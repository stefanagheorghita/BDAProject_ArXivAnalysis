hamming weight function linear code currently know secondary construction technique linear code mainly include puncture shortening extend paper propose novel method secondary construction linear code base weight function specifically develop general framework construct new linear code set codeword give code have fix hamming weight analyze dimension number weight weight distribution construct code establish connection extendability original code partial weight distribution derive code new tool framework enable establish upper bound minimum weight weight code characterize weight code attain bound divisibility property concern parameter weight code derive propose method generate new family linear code provide powerful approach explore intrinsic combinatorial geometric structure exist code
error correct code algebraic surface error correct code define important parameter code explain parameter new code construct algebraic surface study particular code result blow point briefly study code result rule surface cover code result rule surface curve genus completely analyze code discover well direct product reed solomon code similar length rule surface genus curve study class completely analyze case family code find comparable performance direct product code reed solomon code goppa code work surface high genus curve remain work direction understand fully result code code result blow point surface study obtain necessary parameter construct infinite family code include paper give explicit formula curve point previously know certain combination field size genus upper bound know optimal example
