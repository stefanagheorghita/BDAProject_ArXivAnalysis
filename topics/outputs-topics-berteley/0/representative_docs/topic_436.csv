"large-amplitude steady gravity water waves with general vorticity and critical layers. we consider two-dimensional steady periodic gravity waves on water of finite depth with a prescribed but arbitrary vorticity distribution. the water surface is allowed to be overhanging and no assumptions regarding the absence of stagnation points and critical layers are made. using conformal mappings and a new reformulation of bernoulli's equation, we uncover an equivalent formulation as ""identity plus compact,"" which is amenable to rabinowitz's global bifurcation theorem. this allows us to construct a global connected set of solutions, bifurcating from laminar flows with a flat surface. moreover, a nodal analysis is carried out for these solutions under a certain spectral assumption involving the vorticity function. lastly, downstream waves are investigated in more detail."
dispersion equation for water waves with vorticity and stokes waves on flows with counter-currents. the two-dimensional free-boundary problem of steady periodic waves with vorticity is considered for water of finite depth. we investigate how flows with small-amplitude stokes waves on the free surface bifurcate from a horizontal parallel shear flow in which counter-currents may be present. two bifurcation mechanisms are described: for waves with fixed bernoulli's constant and fixed wavelength. in both cases the corresponding dispersion equations serve for defining wavelengths from which stokes waves bifurcate. sufficient conditions guaranteeing the existence of roots of these equations are obtained. two particular vorticity distributions are considered in order to illustrate general results.
"unstable surface waves in running water. we consider the stability of periodic gravity free-surface water waves traveling downstream at a constant speed over a shear flow of finite depth. in case the free surface is flat, a sharp criterion of linear instability is established for a general class of shear flows with inflection points and the maximal unstable wave number is found. comparison to the rigid-wall setting testifies that free surface has a destabilizing effect. for a class of unstable shear flows, the bifurcation of nontrivial periodic traveling waves of small-amplitude is demonstrated at any wave number. we show the linear instability of small nontrivial waves bifurcated at an unstable wave number of the background shear flow. the proof uses a new formulation of the linearized water-wave problem and a perturbation argument. an example of the background shear flow of unstable small-amplitude periodic traveling waves is constructed for an arbitrary vorticity strength and for an arbitrary depth, illustrating that vorticity has a subtle influence on the stability of water waves."
