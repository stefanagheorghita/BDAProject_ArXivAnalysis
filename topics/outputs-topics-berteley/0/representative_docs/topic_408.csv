"on the higher-spin spectrum in large n chern-simons vector models. chern-simons gauge theories coupled to massless fundamental scalars or fermions define interesting non-supersymmetric 3d cfts that possess approximate higher-spin symmetries at large n. in this paper, we compute the scaling dimensions of the higher-spin operators in these models, to leading order in the 1/n expansion and exactly in the 't hooft coupling. we obtain these results in two independent ways: by using conformal symmetry and the classical equations of motion to fix the structure of the current non-conservation, and by a direct feynman diagram calculation. the full dependence on the 't hooft coupling can be restored by using results that follow from the weakly broken higher-spin symmetry. this analysis also allows us to obtain some explicit results for the non-conserved, parity-breaking structures that appear in planar three-point functions of the higher-spin operators. at large spin, we find that the anomalous dimensions grow logarithmically with the spin, in agreement with general expectations. this logarithmic behavior disappears in the strong coupling limit, where the anomalous dimensions turn into those of the critical o(n) or gross-neveu models, in agreement with the conjectured 3d bosonization duality."
"matrix models of fuzzy field theories. we briefly review the connection between the fuzzy field theories and matrix models and describe the main features of the models that appear. we summarize the different approaches to their analysis, some of the recent results and the challenges to be addressed in the future."
"chern-simons theory with vector fermion matter. we study three dimensional conformal field theories described by u(n) chern-simons theory at level k coupled to massless fermions in the fundamental representation. by solving a schwinger-dyson equation in lightcone gauge, we compute the exact planar free energy of the theory at finite temperature on r^2 as a function of the 't hooft coupling lambda=n/k. employing a dimensional reduction regularization scheme, we find that the free energy vanishes at |lambda|=1; the conformal theory does not exist for |lambda|>1. we analyze the operator spectrum via the anomalous conservation relation for higher spin currents, and in particular show that the higher spin currents do not develop anomalous dimensions at leading order in 1/n. we present an integral equation whose solution in principle determines all correlators of these currents at leading order in 1/n and present explicit perturbative results for all three point functions up to two loops. we also discuss a lightcone hamiltonian formulation of this theory where a w-infinity algebra arises. the maximally supersymmetric version of our theory is abj model with one gauge group taken to be u(1), demonstrating that a pure higher spin gauge theory arises as a limit of string theory."
