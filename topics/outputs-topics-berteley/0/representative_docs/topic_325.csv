special representations of weyl groups: a positivity property. we show that the irreducible representation of the asymptotic hecke algebra corresponding to a special representation of a weyl group admits a basis with strong positivity properties.
"double affine hecke algebras and 2-dimensional local fields. we give an interpretation of the double affine hecke algebra of cherednik as the (suitably regularized) algebra of double cosets of a group g by a subgroup j, extending the well known interpretations of finite and affine hecke algebras. in this interpretation, g consists of k-points of a split reductive group where k is a 2-dimensional local field such as q_p((t)) or f_q((t_1))((t_2)), and j is a certain analog of the iwahori subgroup."
"skew hecke algebras. let $g$ be a finite group, $h \le g$ a subgroup, $r$ a commutative ring, $a$ an $r$-algebra, and $\alpha$ an action of $g$ on $a$ by $r$-algebra automorphisms. we study the associated \emph{skew hecke algebra} $\mathcal{h}_{r}(g,h,a,\alpha)$, which is the convolution algebra of $h$-invariant functions from $g/h$ to $a$. we prove for skew hecke algebras a number of common generalisations of results about skew group algebras and results about hecke algebras of finite groups. we show that skew hecke algebras admit a certain double coset decomposition. we construct an isomorphism from $\mathcal{h}_{r}(g,h,a,\alpha)$ to the algebra of $g$-invariants in the tensor product $a \otimes \mathrm{end}_{r} ( \mathrm{ind}_{h}^{g} r )$. we show that if $|h|$ is a unit in $a$, then $\mathcal{h}_{r}(g,h,a,\alpha)$ is isomorphic to a corner ring inside the skew group algebra $a \rtimes g$. alongside our main results, we show that the construction of skew hecke algebras is compatible with certain group-theoretic operations, restriction and extension of scalars, certain cocycle perturbations of the action, gradings and filtrations, and the formation of opposite algebras. the main results are illustrated in the case where $g = s_3$, $h = s_2$, and $\alpha$ is the natural permutation action of $s_3$ on the polynomial algebra $r[x_1,x_2,x_3]$."
