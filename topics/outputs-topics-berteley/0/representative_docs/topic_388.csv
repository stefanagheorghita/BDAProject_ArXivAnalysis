"on the solution existence of nonconvex quadratic programming problems in hilbert spaces. in this paper, we consider the quadratic programming problems under finitely many convex quadratic constraints in hilbert spaces. by using the legendre property of quadratic forms or the compactness of operators in the presentations of quadratic forms, we establish some sufficient conditions for the solution existence of the considered problems. as special cases, we obtain some existence solution results for the quadratic programming problems under linear constraints in hilbert spaces."
"on semidefinite descriptions for convex hulls of quadratic programs. quadratically constrained quadratic programs (qcqps) are a highly expressive class of nonconvex optimization problems. while qcqps are np-hard in general, they admit a natural convex relaxation via the standard semidefinite program (sdp) relaxation. in this paper we study when the convex hull of the epigraph of a qcqp coincides with the projected epigraph of the sdp relaxation. we present a sufficient condition for convex hull exactness and show that this condition is further necessary under an additional geometric assumption. the sufficient condition is based on geometric properties of $\gamma$, the cone of convex lagrange multipliers, and its relatives $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma^\circ$."
"compact mixed-integer programming relaxations in quadratic optimization. we present a technique for producing valid dual bounds for nonconvex quadratic optimization problems. the approach leverages an elegant piecewise linear approximation for univariate quadratic functions due to yarotsky, formulating this (simple) approximation using mixed-integer programming (mip). notably, the number of constraints, binary variables, and auxiliary continuous variables used in this formulation grows logarithmically in the approximation error. combining this with a diagonal perturbation technique to convert a nonseparable quadratic function into a separable one, we present a mixed-integer convex quadratic relaxation for nonconvex quadratic optimization problems. we study the strength (or sharpness) of our formulation and the tightness of its approximation. further, we show that our formulation represents feasible points via a gray code. we close with computational results on problems with quadratic objectives and/or constraints, showing that our proposed method i) across the board outperforms existing mip relaxations from the literature, and ii) on hard instances produces better bounds than exact solvers within a fixed time budget."
