"the thermal memory of reionization history. the recent measurement by wmap of a large electron scattering optical depth tau_e = 0.17 +- 0.04 is consistent with a simple model of reionization in which the intergalactic medium (igm) is ionized at redshift z ~ 15, and remains highly ionized thereafter. here, we show that existing measurements of the igm temperature from the lyman-alpha forest at z ~ 2 - 4 rule out this ``vanilla'' model. under reasonable assumptions about the ionizing spectrum, as long as the universe is reionized before z = 10, and remains highly ionized thereafter, the igm reaches an asymptotic thermal state which is too cold compared to observations. to simultaneously satisfy the cmb and forest constraints, the reionization history must be complex: reionization begins early at z >~ 15, but there must have been significant (order unity) changes in fractions of neutral hydrogen and/or helium at 6 < z < 10, and/or singly ionized helium at 4 < z < 10. we describe a physically motivated reionization model that satisfies all current observations. we also explore the impact of a stochastic reionization history and show that a late epoch of (heii --> heiii) reionization induces a significant scatter in the igm temperature, but the scatter diminishes with time quickly. finally, we provide an analytic formula for the thermal asymptote, and discuss possible additional heating mechanisms that might evade our constraints."
"a measurement of small scale structure in the 2.2 < z < 4.2 lyman-alpha forest. the amplitude of fluctuations in the ly-a forest on small spatial scales is sensitive to the temperature of the igm and its spatial fluctuations. the temperature of the igm and its spatial variations contain important information about hydrogen and helium reionization. we present a new measurement of the small-scale structure in the ly-a forest from 40 high resolution, high signal-to-noise, vlt spectra at z=2.2-4.2. we convolve each ly-a forest spectrum with a suitably chosen wavelet filter, which allows us to extract the amount of small-scale structure in the forest as a function of position across each spectrum. we compare these measurements with high resolution hydrodynamic simulations of the ly-a forest which track more than 2 billion particles. this comparison suggests that the igm temperature close to the cosmic mean density (t_0) peaks near z=3.4, at which point it is greater than 20,000 k at 2-sigma confidence. the temperature at lower redshift is consistent with the fall-off expected from adiabatic cooling ($t_0 \propto (1+z)^2$), after the peak temperature is reached near z=3.4. at z=4.2 our results favor a temperature of t_0 = 15-20,000 k. however, owing mostly to uncertainties in the mean transmitted flux at this redshift, a cooler igm model with t_0 = 10,000 k is only disfavored at the 2-sigma level here, although such cool igm models are strongly discrepant with the z ~ 3-3.4 measurement. we do not detect large spatial fluctuations in the igm temperature at any redshift covered by our data set. the simplest interpretation of our measurements is that heii reionization completes sometime near z ~ 3.4, although statistical uncertainties are still large [abridged]."
"on modeling and measuring the temperature of the z~5 igm. the temperature of the low-density intergalactic medium (igm) at high redshift is sensitive to the timing and nature of hydrogen and heii reionization, and can be measured from lyman-alpha forest absorption spectra. since the memory of intergalactic gas to heating during reionization gradually fades, measurements as close as possible to reionization are desirable. in addition, measuring the igm temperature at sufficiently high redshifts should help to isolate the effects of hydrogen reionization since heii reionization starts later, at lower redshift. motivated by this, we model the igm temperature at z>5 using semi-numeric models of patchy reionization. we construct mock lyman-alpha forest spectra from these models and consider their observable implications. we find that the small-scale structure in the lyman-alpha forest is sensitive to the temperature of the igm even at redshifts where the average absorption in the forest is as high as 90%. we forecast the accuracy at which the z~5 igm temperature can be measured using existing samples of high resolution quasar spectra, and find that interesting constraints are possible. for example, an early reionization model in which reionization ends at z~10 should be distinguishable -- at high statistical significance -- from a lower redshift model where reionization completes at z~6. we discuss improvements to our modeling that may be required to robustly interpret future measurements."
