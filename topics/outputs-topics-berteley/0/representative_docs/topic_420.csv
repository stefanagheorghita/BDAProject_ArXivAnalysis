"on the complexity of hazard-free circuits. the problem of constructing hazard-free boolean circuits dates back to the 1940s and is an important problem in circuit design. our main lower-bound result unconditionally shows the existence of functions whose circuit complexity is polynomially bounded while every hazard-free implementation is provably of exponential size. previous lower bounds on the hazard-free complexity were only valid for depth 2 circuits. the same proof method yields that every subcubic implementation of boolean matrix multiplication must have hazards. these results follow from a crucial structural insight: hazard-free complexity is a natural generalization of monotone complexity to all (not necessarily monotone) boolean functions. thus, we can apply known monotone complexity lower bounds to find lower bounds on the hazard-free complexity. we also lift these methods from the monotone setting to prove exponential hazard-free complexity lower bounds for non-monotone functions. as our main upper-bound result we show how to efficiently convert a boolean circuit into a bounded-bit hazard-free circuit with only a polynomially large blow-up in the number of gates. previously, the best known method yielded exponentially large circuits in the worst case, so our algorithm gives an exponential improvement. as a side result we establish the np-completeness of several hazard detection problems."
"improved lower bounds for monotone q-multilinear boolean circuits. a monotone boolean circuit is composed of or gates, and gates and input gates corresponding to the input variables and the boolean constants. it is $q$-multilinear if for each its output gate $o$ and for each prime implicant $s$ of the function computed at $o$, the arithmetic version of the circuit resulting from the replacement of or and and gates by addition and multiplication gates, respectively, computes a polynomial at $o$ which contains a monomial including the same variables as $s$ and each of the variables in $s$ has degree at most $q$ in the monomial. first, we study the complexity of computing semi-disjoint bilinear boolean forms in terms of the size of monotone $q$-multilinear boolean circuits. in particular, we show that any monotone $1$-multilinear boolean circuit computing a semi-disjoint boolean form with $p$ prime implicants includes at least $p$ and gates. we also show that any monotone $q$-multilinear boolean circuit computing a semi-disjoint boolean form with $p$ prime implicants has $\omega(\frac p {q^4})$ size. next, we study the complexity of the monotone boolean function $isol_{k,n}$ that verifies if a $k$-dimensional boolean matrix has at least one $1$ in each line (e.g., each row and column when $k=2$), in terms of monotone $q$-multilinear boolean circuits. we show that that any $\sigma_3$ monotone boolean circuit for $isol_{k,n}$ has an exponential in $n$ size or it is not $(k-1)$-multilinear."
"and and/or or: uniform polynomial-size circuits. we investigate the complexity of uniform or circuits and and circuits of polynomial-size and depth. as their name suggests, or circuits have or gates as their computation gates, as well as the usual input, output and constant (0/1) gates. as is the norm for boolean circuits, our circuits have multiple sink gates, which implies that an or circuit computes an or function on some subset of its input variables. determining that subset amounts to solving a number of reachability questions on a polynomial-size directed graph (which input gates are connected to the output gate?), taken from a very sparse set of graphs. however, it is not obvious whether or not this (restricted) reachability problem can be solved, by say, uniform ac^0 circuits (constant depth, polynomial-size, and, or, not gates). this is one reason why characterizing the power of these simple-looking circuits in terms of uniform classes turns out to be intriguing. another is that the model itself seems particularly natural and worthy of study. our goal is the systematic characterization of uniform polynomial-size or circuits, and and circuits, in terms of known uniform machine-based complexity classes. in particular, we consider the languages reducible to such uniform families of or circuits, and and circuits, under a variety of reduction types. we give upper and lower bounds on the computational power of these language classes. we find that these complexity classes are closely related to tallynl, the set of unary languages within nl, and to sets reducible to tallynl. specifically, for a variety of types of reductions (many-one, conjunctive truth table, disjunctive truth table, truth table, turing) we give characterizations of languages reducible to or circuit classes in terms of languages reducible to tallynl classes. then, some of these or classes are shown to coincide, and some are proven to be distinct. we give analogous results for and circuits. finally, for many of our or circuit classes, and analogous and circuit classes, we prove whether or not the two classes coincide, although we leave one such inclusion open."
