"optimal projection guided transfer hashing for image retrieval. recently, learning to hash has been widely studied for image retrieval thanks to the computation and storage efficiency of binary codes. for most existing learning to hash methods, sufficient training images are required and used to learn precise hashing codes. however, in some real-world applications, there are not always sufficient training images in the domain of interest. in addition, some existing supervised approaches need a amount of labeled data, which is an expensive process in term of time, label and human expertise. to handle such problems, inspired by transfer learning, we propose a simple yet effective unsupervised hashing method named optimal projection guided transfer hashing (gth) where we borrow the images of other different but related domain i.e., source domain to help learn precise hashing codes for the domain of interest i.e., target domain. besides, we propose to seek for the maximum likelihood estimation (mle) solution of the hashing functions of target and source domains due to the domain gap. furthermore,an alternating optimization method is adopted to obtain the two projections of target and source domains such that the domain hashing disparity is reduced gradually. extensive experiments on various benchmark databases verify that our method outperforms many state-of-the-art learning to hash methods. the implementation details are available at https://github.com/liuji93/gth."
"online hashing with similarity learning. online hashing methods usually learn the hash functions online, aiming to efficiently adapt to the data variations in the streaming environment. however, when the hash functions are updated, the binary codes for the whole database have to be updated to be consistent with the hash functions, resulting in the inefficiency in the online image retrieval process. in this paper, we propose a novel online hashing framework without updating binary codes. in the proposed framework, the hash functions are fixed and a parametric similarity function for the binary codes is learnt online to adapt to the streaming data. specifically, a parametric similarity function that has a bilinear form is adopted and a metric learning algorithm is proposed to learn the similarity function online based on the characteristics of the hashing methods. the experiments on two multi-label image datasets show that our method is competitive or outperforms the state-of-the-art online hashing methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency for multi-label image retrieval."
"hashing on nonlinear manifolds. learning based hashing methods have attracted considerable attention due to their ability to greatly increase the scale at which existing algorithms may operate. most of these methods are designed to generate binary codes preserving the euclidean similarity in the original space. manifold learning techniques, in contrast, are better able to model the intrinsic structure embedded in the original high-dimensional data. the complexities of these models, and the problems with out-of-sample data, have previously rendered them unsuitable for application to large-scale embedding, however. in this work, how to learn compact binary embeddings on their intrinsic manifolds is considered. in order to address the above-mentioned difficulties, an efficient, inductive solution to the out-of-sample data problem, and a process by which non-parametric manifold learning may be used as the basis of a hashing method is proposed. the proposed approach thus allows the development of a range of new hashing techniques exploiting the flexibility of the wide variety of manifold learning approaches available. it is particularly shown that hashing on the basis of t-sne outperforms state-of-the-art hashing methods on large-scale benchmark datasets, and is very effective for image classification with very short code lengths. the proposed hashing framework is shown to be easily improved, for example, by minimizing the quantization error with learned orthogonal rotations. in addition, a supervised inductive manifold hashing framework is developed by incorporating the label information, which is shown to greatly advance the semantic retrieval performance."
