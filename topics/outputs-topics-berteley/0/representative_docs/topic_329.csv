"bounds on the dynamics of periodic quantum walks and emergence of the gapless and gapped dirac equation. we study the dynamics of discrete-time quantum walk using quantum coin operations, $\hat{c}(\theta_1)$ and $\hat{c}(\theta_2)$ in time-dependent periodic sequence. for the two-period quantum walk with the parameters $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ in the coin operations we show that the standard deviation [$\sigma_{\theta_1, \theta_2} (t)$] is the same as the minimum of standard deviation obtained from one of the one-period quantum walks with coin operations $\theta_1$ or $\theta_2$, $\sigma_{\theta_1, \theta_2}(t) = \min \{\sigma_{\theta_1}(t), \sigma_{\theta_2}(t) \}$. our numerical result is analytically corroborated using the dispersion relation obtained from the continuum limit of the dynamics. using the dispersion relation for one- and two-period quantum walks, we present the bounds on the dynamics of three- and higher period quantum walks. we also show that the bounds for the two-period quantum walk will hold good for the split-step quantum walk which is also defined using two coin operators using $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$. unlike the previous known connection of discrete-time quantum walks with the massless dirac equation where coin parameter $\theta=0$, here we show the recovery of the massless dirac equation with non-zero $\theta$ parameters contributing to the intriguing interference in the dynamics in a totally non-relativistic situation. we also present the effect of periodic sequence on the entanglement between coin and position space."
"quantum walks with an anisotropic coin ii: scattering theory. we perform the scattering analysis of the evolution operator of quantum walks with an anisotropic coin, and we prove a weak limit theorem for their asymptotic velocity. the quantum walks that we consider include one-defect models, two-phase quantum walks, and topological phase quantum walks as special cases. our analysis is based on an abstract framework for the scattering theory of unitary operators in a two-hilbert spaces setting, which is of independent interest."
"a quantum walk on the half line with a particular initial state. quantum walks are considered to be quantum counterparts of random walks.they show us impressive probability distributions which are different from those of random walks.that fact has been precisely proved in terms of mathematics and some of the results were reported as limit theorems.when we analyze quantum walks, some conventional methods are used for the computations.especially, the fourier analysis has played a role to do that.it is, however, compatible with some types of quantum walks (e.g. quantum walks on the line with a spatially homogeneous dynamics) and can not well work on the derivation of limit theorems for all the quantum walks.in this paper we try to obtain a limit theorem for a quantum walk on the half line by the usage of the fourier analysis.substituting a quantum walk on the line for it, we will lead to a possibility that the fourier analysis is useful to compute a limit distribution of the quantum walk on the half line."
