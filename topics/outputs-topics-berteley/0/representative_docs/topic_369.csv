"room-temperature terahertz anomalous hall effect in weyl antiferromagnet mn$_3$sn thin films. antiferromagnetic spin motion at terahertz (thz) frequencies attracts growing interests for fast spintronics, however their smaller responses to external field inhibit device application. recently the noncollinear antiferromagnet mn$_3$sn, a weyl semimetal candidate, was reported to show large anomalous hall effect (ahe) at room temperature comparable to ferromagnets. dynamical aspect of such large responses is an important issue to be clarified for future thz data processing. here the thz anomalous hall conductivity in mn$_3$sn thin films is investigated by polarization-resolved spectroscopy. large anomalous hall conductivity re $\sigma_{xy} (\omega) \sim$ 20 $\rm{\omega^{-1} cm^{-1}}$ at thz frequencies is clearly observed as polarization rotation. in contrast, im $\sigma_{xy} (\omega)$ is small up to a few thz, showing that the ahe remains dissipationless over a large frequency range. a peculiar temperature dependence corresponding to the breaking/recovery of symmetry in the spin texture is also discussed. observation of the thz ahe at room temperature demonstrates the ultrafast readout for the antiferromagnetic spintronics using mn$_3$sn and will also open new avenue for studying nonequilibrium dynamics in weyl antiferromagnets."
"altermagnetic splitting of magnons in hematite ($\alpha$-fe$_2$o$_3$). we develop a four-sublattice spin-wave theory for the $g$-wave altermagnet candidate hematite ($\alpha$-fe$_2$o$_3$), considering both its easy-axis phase below and its weak ferromagnetic phase above the morin temperature. a key question is whether the defining altermagnetic feature - magnon spin splitting (also called chirality or polarization splitting) due to nonrelativistic time-reversal symmetry breaking - remains intact when relativistic corrections, which contribute to hematite's magnetic order, are included. using a detailed symmetry analysis supported by density functional theory, we show that capturing the magnon splitting within a heisenberg model requires exchange interactions extending at least to the 13th neighbor. we find an altermagnetic band splitting of approximately 2 mev, which contrasts with the total band width of about 100 mev. to evaluate the experimental observability of this splitting, we analyze relativistic corrections to the magnon spectrum in both magnetic phases. we show that spin-orbit coupling - manifesting as magnetocrystalline anisotropies and the dzyaloshinskii-moriya interaction (dmi) - does not obscure the key altermagnetic features. these findings indicate that inelastic neutron scattering can directly probe altermagnetic magnon splitting in hematite. we also discuss implications for magnon transport, particularly magnonic contributions to the thermal hall effect (which requires spin-orbit coupling) and to spin splitter effects (which do not). notably, we predict a third-order nonlinear magnon spin splitter effect. this result suggests that the $g$-wave magnon spin splitting in hematite enables transverse heat-to-spin conversion without requiring an external magnetic field."
"spontaneous anomalous hall effect arising from an unconventional compensated magnetic phase in a semiconductor. the anomalous hall effect, commonly observed in metallic magnets, has been established to originate from the time-reversal symmetry breaking by an internal macroscopic magnetization in ferromagnets or by a non-collinear magnetic order. here we observe a spontaneous anomalous hall signal in the absence of an external magnetic field in an epitaxial film of mnte, which is a semiconductor with a collinear antiparallel magnetic ordering of mn moments and a vanishing net magnetization. the anomalous hall effect arises from an unconventional phase with strong time-reversal symmetry breaking and alternating spin polarization in real-space crystal structure and momentum-space electronic structure. the anisotropic crystal environment of magnetic mn atoms due to the non-magnetic te atoms is essential for establishing the unconventional phase and generating the anomalous hall effect."
