"imbalanced malware classification: an approach based on dynamic classifier selection. in recent years, the rise of cyber threats has emphasized the need for robust malware detection systems, especially on mobile devices. malware, which targets vulnerabilities in devices and user data, represents a substantial security risk. a significant challenge in malware detection is the imbalance in datasets, where most applications are benign, with only a small fraction posing a threat. this study addresses the often-overlooked issue of class imbalance in malware detection by evaluating various machine learning strategies for detecting malware in android applications. we assess monolithic classifiers and ensemble methods, focusing on dynamic selection algorithms, which have shown superior performance compared to traditional approaches. in contrast to balancing strategies performed on the whole dataset, we propose a balancing procedure that works individually for each classifier in the pool. our empirical analysis demonstrates that the knop algorithm obtained the best results using a pool of random forest. additionally, an instance hardness assessment revealed that balancing reduces the difficulty of the minority class and enhances the detection of the minority class (malware). the code used for the experiments is available at https://github.com/jvss2/machine-learning-empirical-evaluation."
"android inter-app communication threats, solutions, and challenges. researchers and commercial companies have made a lot of efforts on detecting malware in android platform. however, a recent malware threat, app collusion, makes malware detection challenging. in app collusion, two or more apps collaborate to perform malicious actions by communicating with each other, which makes single app analysis insufficient. in this paper, we first introduce android security mechanism and communication channels used by android applications. then we summarize the security vulnerabilities and potential threats introduced by app communication. finally, we discuss state of art researches and challenges on app collusion detection."
"a survey on the detection of android malicious apps. android-based smart devices are exponentially growing, and due to the ubiquity of the internet, these devices are globally connected to the different devices/networks. its popularity, attractive features, and mobility make malware creator to put a number of malicious apps in the market to disrupt and annoy the victims. although to identify the malicious apps, time-to-time various techniques are proposed. however, it appears that malware developers are always ahead of the anti-malware group, and the proposed techniques by the anti-malware groups are not sufficient to counter the advanced malicious apps. therefore, to understand the various techniques proposed/used for the identification of android malicious apps, in this paper, we present a survey conducted by us on the work done by the researchers in this field."
