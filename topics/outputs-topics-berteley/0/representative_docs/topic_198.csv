"a dividing line within simple unstable theories. we give the first (zfc) dividing line in keisler's order among the unstable theories, specifically among the simple unstable theories. that is, for any infinite cardinal $\lambda$ for which there is $\mu < \lambda \leq 2^\mu$, we construct a regular ultrafilter d on $\lambda$ such that (i) for any model $m$ of a stable theory or of the random graph, $m^\lambda/d$ is $\lambda^+$-saturated but (ii) if $th(n)$ is not simple or not low then $n^\lambda/d$ is not $\lambda^+$-saturated. the non-saturation result relies on the notion of flexible ultrafilters. to prove the saturation result we develop a property of a class of simple theories, called qr1, generalizing the fact that whenever $b$ is a set of parameters in some sufficiently saturated model of the random graph, $|b| = \lambda$ and $\mu < \lambda \leq 2^\mu$, then there is a set $a$ with $|a| = \mu$ such that any non-algebraic $p \in s(b)$ is finitely realized in $a$. in addition to giving information about simple unstable theories, our proof reframes the problem of saturation of ultrapowers in several key ways. we give a new characterization of good filters in terms of ""excellence,"" a measure of the accuracy of the quotient boolean algebra. we introduce and develop the notion of {moral} ultrafilters on boolean algebras. we prove a so-called ""separation of variables"" result which shows how the problem of constructing ultrafilters to have a precise degree of saturation may be profitably separated into a more set-theoretic stage, building an excellent filter, followed by a more model-theoretic stage: building moral ultrafilters on the quotient boolean algebra, a process which highlights the complexity of certain patterns, arising from first-order formulas, in certain boolean algebras."
"an axiomatic approach to higher order set theory. higher order set theory has been a topic of interest for some time, with recent efforts focused on the strength of second order set theories [kw16]. in this paper we strive to present one 'theory of collections' that allows for a formal consideration of 'countable higher order set theory'. we will see that this theory is equiconsistent with $zfc$ plus the existence of a countable collection of inaccessible cardinals. we will also see that this theory serves as a canonical foundation for some parts of mathematics not covered by standard set/class theories (e.g. $zfc$ or $mk$), such as category theory."
"mechanizing set theory: cardinal arithmetic and the axiom of choice.. fairly deep results of zermelo-frenkel (zf) set theory have been mechanized using the proof assistant isabelle. the results concern cardinal arithmetic and the axiom of choice (ac). a key result about cardinal multiplication is k*k = k, where k is any infinite cardinal. proving this result required developing theories of orders, order-isomorphisms, order types, ordinal arithmetic, cardinals, etc.; this covers most of kunen, set theory, chapter i. furthermore, we have proved the equivalence of 7 formulations of the well-ordering theorem and 20 formulations of ac; this covers the first two chapters of rubin and rubin, equivalents of the axiom of choice, and involves highly technical material. the definitions used in the proofs are largely faithful in style to the original mathematics."
