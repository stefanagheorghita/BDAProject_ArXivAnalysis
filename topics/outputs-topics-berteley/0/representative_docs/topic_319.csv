iterative coupling of mixed and discontinuous galerkin methods for poroelasticity. we analyze an iterative coupling of mixed and discontinuous galerkin methods for numerical modelling of coupled flow and mechanical deformation in porous media. the iteration is based on an optimized fixed-stress split along with a discontinuous variational time discretization. for the spatial discretization of the subproblem of flow mixed finite element techniques are applied. the discretization of the subproblem of mechanical deformation uses discontinuous galerkin methods. they have shown their ability to eliminate locking that sometimes arises in numerical algorithms for poroelasticity and causes nonphysical pressure oscillations.
"a coupled multipoint stress -- multipoint flux mixed finite element method for the biot system of poroelasticity. we present a mixed finite element method for a five-field formulation of the biot system of poroelasticity that reduces to a cell-centered pressure-displacement system on simplicial and quadrilateral grids. a mixed stress-displacement-rotation formulation for elasticity with weak stress symmetry is coupled with a mixed velocity-pressure darcy formulation. the spatial discretization is based on combining the multipoint stress mixed finite element (msmfe) method for elasticity and the multipoint flux mixed finite element (mfmfe) method for darcy flow. it uses the lowest order brezzi-douglas-marini mixed finite element spaces for the poroelastic stress and darcy velocity, piecewise constant displacement and pressure, and continuous piecewise linear or bilinear rotation. a vertex quadrature rule is applied to the velocity, stress, and stress-rotation bilinear forms, which block-diagonalizes the corresponding matrices and allows for local velocity, stress, and rotation elimination. this leads to a cell-centered positive-definite system for pressure and displacement at each time step. we perform error analysis for the semidiscrete and fully discrete formulations, establishing first order convergence for all variables in their natural norms. the numerical tests confirm the theoretical convergence rates and illustrate the locking-free property of the method."
"domain decomposition and partitioning methods for mixed finite element discretizations of the biot system of poroelasticity. we develop non-overlapping domain decomposition methods for the biot system of poroelasticity in a mixed form. the solid deformation is modeled with a mixed three-field formulation with weak stress symmetry. the fluid flow is modeled with a mixed darcy formulation. we introduce displacement and pressure lagrange multipliers on the subdomain interfaces to impose weakly continuity of normal stress and normal velocity, respectively. the global problem is reduced to an interface problem for the lagrange multipliers, which is solved by a krylov space iterative method. we study both monolithic and split methods. in the monolithic method, a coupled displacement-pressure interface problem is solved, with each iteration requiring the solution of local biot problems. we show that the resulting interface operator is positive definite and analyze the convergence of the iteration. we further study drained split and fixed stress biot splittings, in which case we solve separate interface problems requiring elasticity and darcy solves. we analyze the stability of the split formulations. numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the convergence of the domain decomposition methods and compare their accuracy and efficiency."
