magnetic field at the center of a vortex: a new criterion for the classification of the superconductors. magnetic response of a superconductor depends on the thermodynamic stability of vortex in the material. here we show that the vortex stability has a close relation with the ratio of the magnetic field at the vortex core center to the thermodynamic critical field. this finding provides a new criterion for the classification of the superconductors according to their magnetic responses.
"electronic structure of a single vortex in d-wave superconductor revisited. the present work deals with the study of d-wave superconductor in presence of a single vortex placed at the centre of the 2d lattice using the $t-t'-j$ model within the renormalized mean field theory. it is found that the in absence of the vortex the ground state has a d-wave configuration. in presence of the vortex, the superconducting order parameter, above the critical doping, drops to a low non zero value within a few lattice points from the vortex (that is within the the vortex core) and beyond it converges to the constant value in absence of vortex. we observe that above the critical doping things are consistent with the experimental results while there is an anomalous rise in the superconducting order parameter at very low doping within the vortex core. this we feel is because of antiferromagnetic ordering taking place within the vortex core at low doping."
"perspective: challenges and transformative opportunities in superconductor vortex physics. in superconductors, the motion of vortices introduces unwanted dissipation that is disruptive to applications. fortunately, material defects can immobilize vortices, acting as vortex pinning centers, which engenders dramatic improvements in superconductor material properties and device operation. this has motivated decades of research into developing methods of tailoring the disorder landscape in superconductors to increase the strength of vortex pinning. yet efficacious materials engineering still alludes us. the electromagnetic properties of real (disordered) superconducting materials cannot yet be reliably predicted, such that designing superconductors for applications remains a largely inefficient process of trial and error. this is ultimately due to large gaps in our knowledge of vortex dynamics: the field is challenged by the extremely complex interplay between vortex elasticity, vortex-vortex interactions, and material disorder. in this perspective, we review obstacles and recent successes in understanding and controlling vortex dynamics in superconducting materials and devices. we further identify major open questions and discuss opportunities for transformative research in the field. this includes improving our understanding of vortex creep, determining and reaching the ceiling for the critical current, advanced microscopy to garner accurate structure-property relationships, frontiers in predictive simulations and the benefits of artificial intelligence, as well as controlling and exploiting vortices in quantum information applications."
