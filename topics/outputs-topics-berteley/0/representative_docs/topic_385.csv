"non-magnetic impurities in two dimensional superconductors. a numerical approach to disordered 2d superconductors described by bcs mean field theory is outlined. the energy gap and the superfluid density at zero temperature and the quasiparticle density of states are studied. the method involves approximate self-consistent solutions of the bogolubov-de$\,$gennes equations on finite square lattices. where comparison is possible, the results of standard analytic approaches to this problem are reproduced. detailed modeling of impurity effects is practical using this approach. the {\it range} of the impurity potential is shown to be of {\it quantitative importance} in the case of strong potential scatterers. we discuss the implications for experiments, such as the rapid suppression of superconductivity by zn doping in copper-oxide superconductors."
"impurity strength-temperature phase diagram with phase crystals and competing time-reversal symmetry breaking states in nodal $d$-wave superconductors. phase crystals are a class of nonuniform superconducting ground states characterized by spontaneous phase gradients of the superconducting order parameter. these phase gradients nonlocally drive periodic currents and magnetic fields, thus breaking both time-reversal symmetry and continuous translational symmetry. the phase crystal instability is generally triggered by negative and inhomogeneous superfluid stiffness. several scenarios have been identified that can realize phase crystals, especially flat bands at specific edges of unconventional nodal superconductors. motivated by omnipresent disorder in all materials, we employ the ${t}$-matrix approach within the quasiclassical theory of superconductivity to study the emergence of phase crystals at edges of a nodal $d$-wave superconductor. we quantify the full phase diagram as a function of the impurity scattering energy and the temperature, with full self-consistency in the impurity self energies, the superconducting order parameter, and the vector potential. we find that the phase crystal survives even up to $\sim 40-50\%$ of the superconducting critical impurity strength in both the born and unitary scattering limits. finally, we show how mesoscopic finite-size effects induce a competition with a state still breaking time-reversal symmetry but with translationally invariant edge currents."
"impurity scattering in superconductors. we present some of the recent theoretical studies on the impurity effects in conventional superconductors, such as magnetic and ordinary impurity effects in dirty and weak localization limits, and describe successfully unexplained experimental results. we find that the critical sheet resistance for the suppression of superconductivity in thin films depends on superconductor, and point out that impurity dopings in high t_c superconductors cause a metal-insulator transition and thereby suppress t_c."
