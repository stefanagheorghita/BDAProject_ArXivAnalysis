"josephson junctions in narrow thin-film strips. we study the field dependence of the maximum supercurrent in narrow edge-type thin-film josephson junctions. it is assumed that the junction extends across thin-film strip of width w that is much less than the pearl length; the film thickness is much less than the london penetration depth. we calculate the maximum supercurrent within nonlocal josephson electrodynamics, which takes into account the stray fields affecting tunneling currents. in the case when w is much less than the thin-film josephson length, the phase difference along the junction depends only on the junction geometry and the applied field, but is independent of the josephson critical current density, i.e., it is universal. zeros of the maximum supercurrent are equidistant only in large fields (unlike the case of junctions with bulk banks); they are spaced by a field that is much smaller than the one of bulk junctions. peaks of the maximum supercurrent decrease inversely proportional to the square root of the applied field, i.e., slower than 1/h for the bulk."
"josephson effect in thin-film superconductor/insulator/superconductor junctions with misaligned in-plane magnetic fields. we study a tunnel junction consisting of two thin-film s-wave superconductors separated by a thin, insulating barrier in the presence of misaligned in-plane exchange fields. we find an interesting interplay between the superconducting phase difference and the relative orientation of the exchange fields, manifested in the josephson current across the junction. specifically, this may be written $i_\text{j}^\text{c} = (i_0+i_m ~ \cos\phi) \sin\delta\theta$, where i_0 and i_m are constants, and $\phi$ is the relative orientation of the exchange fields while $\delta\theta$ is the superconducting phase difference. similar results have recently been obtained in other s/i/s junctions coexisting with helimagnetic or ferromagnetic order. we calculate the superconducting order parameter self-consistently, and investigate quantitatively the effect which the misaligned exchange fields constitute on the josephson current, to see if i_m may have an appreciable effect on the josephson current. it is found that i_0 and i_m become comparable in magnitude at sufficiently low temperatures and fields close to the critical value, in agreement with previous work. from our analytical results, it then follows that the josephson current in the present system may be controlled in a well-defined manner by a rotation of the exchange fields on both sides of the junction. we discuss a possible experimental realization of this proposition."
anomalous proximity effect in underdoped ybacuo josephson junctions. josephson junctions were photogenerated in underdoped thin films of the yba$_2$cu$_3$o$_{6+x}$ family using a near-field scanning optical microscope. the observation of the josephson effect for separations as large as 100 nm between two wires indicates the existence of an anomalously large proximity effect and show that the underdoped insulating material in the gap of the junction is readily perturbed into the superconducting state. the critical current of the junctions was found to be consistent with the conventional josephson relationship. this result constrains the applicability of so(5) theory to explain the phase diagram of high critical temperature superconductors.
