"star-forming cloud complexes in the central molecular zone of ngc 253. we report 350 and 230 ghz observations of molecular gas and dust in the starburst nucleus of ngc 253 at 20-40 pc (1""-2"") resolution. the data contain co(3-2), hcn(4-3), co(2-1), 13co(2-1), c18o(2-1), and continuum at 0.87 mm and 1.3 mm toward the central kiloparsec. the co(2-1) size of the galaxy's central molecular zone (cmz) is measured to be about 300 pc x 100 pc at the half maximum of intensity. five clumps of dense and warm gas stand out in the cmz at arcsecond resolution, and they are associated with compact radio sources due to recent massive star formation. they contribute one third of the co emission in the central 300 pc and have 12co peak brightness temperatures around 50 k, molecular gas column densities on the order of 10^{4} msun pc^{-2}, gas masses on the order of 10^{7} msun in the size scale of 20 pc, volume-averaged gas densities of n(h2) ~ 4000 cm^{-3}, and high hcn-to-co ratios suggestive of higher fractions of dense gas than in the surrounding environment. it is suggested that these are natal molecular cloud complexes of massive star formation. the cmz of ngc 253 is also compared with that of our galaxy in co(2-1) at the same 20 pc resolution. their overall gas distributions are strikingly similar. the five molecular cloud complexes appear to be akin to such molecular complexes as sgr a, sgr b2, sgr c, and the l=1.3deg cloud in the galactic center. on the other hand, the starburst cmz in ngc 253 has higher temperatures and higher surface (and presumably volume) densities than its non-starburst cousin."
"dense cloud formation and star formation in a barred galaxy. we investigate the properties of massive, dense clouds formed in a barred galaxy and their possible relation to star formation, performing a two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulation with the gravitational potential obtained from the 2mass data from the barred spiral galaxy, m83. since the environment for cloud formation and evolution in the bar region is expected to be different from that in the spiral arm region, barred galaxies are a good target to study the environmental effects on cloud formation and the subsequent star formation. our simulation uses for an initial 80 myr an isothermal flow of non-self gravitating gas in the barred potential, then including radiative cooling, heating and self-gravitation of the gas for the next 40 myr, during which dense clumps are formed. we identify many cold, dense gas clumps for which the mass is more than $10^4m_{\odot}$ (a value corresponding to the molecular clouds) and study the physical properties of these clumps. the relation of the velocity dispersion of the identified clump's internal motion with the clump size is similar to that observed in the molecular clouds of our galaxy. we find that the virial parameters for clumps in the bar region are larger than that in the spiral arm region. from our numerical results, we estimate star formation in the bar and spiral arm regions by applying the simple model of krumholtz and mckee (2005). the mean relation between star formation rate and gas surface density agrees well with the observed kennicutt-schmidt relation. the sfe in the bar region is $\sim 60 %$ of the spiral arm region. this trend is consistent with observations of barred galaxies."
"dense gas is not enough: environmental variations in the star formation efficiency of dense molecular gas at 100pc scales in m51. it remains unclear what sets the efficiency with which molecular gas transforms into stars. here we present a new vla map of the spiral galaxy m51 in 33ghz radio continuum, an extinction-free tracer of star formation, at 3"" scales (~100pc). we combined this map with interferometric pdbi/noema observations of co(1-0) and hcn(1-0) at matched resolution for three regions in m51 (central molecular ring, northern and southern spiral arm segments). while our measurements roughly fall on the well-known correlation between total infrared and hcn luminosity, bridging the gap between galactic and extragalactic observations, we find systematic offsets from that relation for different dynamical environments probed in m51, e.g. the southern arm segment is more quiescent due to low star formation efficiency (sfe) of the dense gas, despite having a high dense gas fraction. combining our results with measurements from the literature at 100pc scales, we find that the sfe of the dense gas and the dense gas fraction anti-correlate and correlate, respectively, with the local stellar mass surface density. this is consistent with previous kpc-scale studies. in addition, we find a significant anti-correlation between the sfe and velocity dispersion of the dense gas. finally, we confirm that a correlation also holds between star formation rate surface density and the dense gas fraction, but it is not stronger than the correlation with dense gas surface density. our results are hard to reconcile with models relying on a universal gas density threshold for star formation and suggest that turbulence and galactic dynamics play a major role in setting how efficiently dense gas converts into stars."
