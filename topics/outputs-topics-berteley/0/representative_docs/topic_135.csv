"regularity of the solution to 1-d fractional order diffusion equations. in this article we investigate the solution of the steady-state fractional diffusion equation on a bounded domain in $\real^{1}$. from an analysis of the underlying model problem, we postulate that the fractional diffusion operator in the modeling equations is neither the riemann-liouville nor the caputo fractional differential operators. we then find a closed form expression for the kernel of the fractional diffusion operator which, in most cases, determines the regularity of the solution. next we establish that the jacobi polynomials are pseudo eigenfunctions for the fractional diffusion operator. a spectral type approximation method for the solution of the steady-state fractional diffusion equation is then proposed and studied."
"fractional maps as maps with power-law memory. the study of systems with memory requires methods which are different from the methods used in regular dynamics. systems with power-law memory in many cases can be described by fractional differential equations, which are integro-differential equations. to study the general properties of nonlinear fractional dynamical systems we use fractional maps, which are discrete nonlinear systems with power-law memory derived from fractional differential equations. to study fractional maps we use the notion of $\alpha$-families of maps depending on a single parameter $\alpha > 0$ which is the order of the fractional derivative in a nonlinear fractional differential equation describing a system experiencing periodic kicks. $\alpha$-families of maps represent a very general form of multi-dimensional nonlinear maps with power-law memory, in which the weight of the previous state at time $t_i$ in defining the present state at time $t$ is proportional to $(t-{t_i})^{\alpha-1}$. they may be applicable to studying some systems with memory such as viscoelastic materials, electromagnetic fields in dielectric media, hamiltonian systems, adaptation in biological systems, human memory, etc. using the fractional logistic and standard $\alpha$-families of maps as examples we demonstrate that the phase space of nonlinear fractional dynamical systems may contain periodic sinks, attracting slow diverging trajectories, attracting accelerator mode trajectories, chaotic attractors, and cascade of bifurcations type trajectories %with some new properties. whose properties are different from properties of attractors in regular dynamical systems."
"on initial conditions for fractional delay differential equations. derivatives of fractional order are introduced in different ways: as left-inverse of the fractional integral or by generalizing the limit of the difference quotient defining integer-order derivatives. although the two approaches lead (under standard smoothness assumptions) to equivalent operators, the first one does not involve the function at the left of the initial point where, instead, the latter forces the function to assume selected values. with fractional delay differential equations new problems arise: the presence of the delay imposes to assign the solution not just at the initial point but on an entire interval. due to the freedom in the choice of the initial function, some inconsistencies with the values forced by the fractional derivative are possible and the operators may no longer be equivalent. in this paper we discuss the initialization of fractional delay differential equations, we investigate the effects of the initial condition not only on the solution but also on the fractional operator as well and we study the difference between solutions obtained by incorporating or not the initial function in the memory of the fractional derivative. the exact solution of a family of linear equations is obtained by the laplace transform whilst numerical methods are used to solve nonlinear problems; the different results are therefore shown and commented."
