"photoacoustic digital brain: numerical modelling and image reconstruction via deep learning. photoacoustic tomography (pat) is a newly developed medical imaging modality, which combines the advantages of pure optical imaging and ultrasound imaging, owning both high optical contrast and deep penetration depth. very recently, pat is studied in human brain imaging. nevertheless, while ultrasound waves are passing through the human skull tissues, the strong acoustic attenuation and aberration will happen, which causes photoacoustic signals' distortion. in this work, we use 10 magnetic resonance angiography (mra) human brain volumes, and manually segment them to obtain the 2d human brain numerical phantoms for pat. the numerical phantoms contain six kinds of tissues which are scalp, skull, white matter, gray matter, blood vessel and cerebral cortex. for every numerical phantom, optical properties are assigned to every kind of tissues. then, monte-carlo based optical simulation is deployed to obtain the photoacoustic initial pressure. then, we made two k-wave simulation cases: one takes inhomogeneous medium and uneven sound velocity into consideration, and the other not. then we use the sensor data of the former one as the input of u-net, and the sensor data of the latter one as the output of u-net to train the network. we randomly choose 7 human brain pa sinograms as the training dataset and 3 human brain pa sinograms as the testing set. the testing result shows that our method could correct the skull acoustic aberration and obtain the blood vessel distribution inside the human brain satisfactorily."
"an optimized ultrasound detector for photoacoustic breast tomography. photoacoustic imaging has proven to be able to detect vascularization-driven optical absorption contrast associated with tumors. in order to detect breast tumors located a few centimeter deep in tissue, a sensitive ultrasound detector is of crucial importance for photoacoustic mammography. further, because the expected photoacoustic frequency bandwidth (a few mhz to tens of khz) is inversely proportional to the dimensions of light absorbing structures (0.5 to 10+ mm), proper choices of materials and their geometries, and proper considerations in design have to be made for optimal photoacoustic detectors. in this study, we design and evaluate a specialized ultrasound detector for photoacoustic mammography. based on the required detector sensitivity and its frequency response, a selection of active material and matching layers and their geometries is made leading to a functional detector models. by iteration between simulation of detector performances, fabrication and experimental characterization of functional models an optimized implementation is made and evaluated. the experimental results of the designed first and second functional detectors matched with the simulations. in subsequent bare piezoelectric samples the effect of lateral resonances was addressed and their influence minimized by sub-dicing the samples. consequently, using simulations, the final optimized detector could be designed, with a center frequency of 1 mhz and a -6 db bandwidth of ~80%. the minimum detectable pressure was measured to be 0.5 pa, which will facilitate deeper imaging compared to the currrent systems. the detector should be capable of detecting vascularized tumors with resolution of 1-2 mm. further improvements by proper electrical grounding and shielding and implementation of this design into an arrayed detector will pave the way for clinical applications of photoacoustic mammography."
"a numerical model for the study of photoacoustic imaging of brain tumours. photoacoustic imaging has shown great promise for medical imaging, where optical energy absorption by blood haemoglobin is used as the contrast mechanism. a numerical method was developed for the in-silico assessment of the photoacoustic image reconstruction of the brain. image segmentation techniques were used to prepare a digital phantom from mr images. light transport through brain tissue was modelled using a finite element approach. the resulting acoustic pressure was then estimated by pulsed photoacoustics considerations. the forward acoustic wave propagation was modelled by the linearized coupled first order wave equations and solved by an acoustic k-space method. since skull bone is an elastic solid and strongly attenuates ultrasound (due to both scattering and absorption), a k-space method was developed for elastic media. to model scattering effects, a new approach was applied based on propagation in random media. in addition, absorption effects were incorporated using a power law. finally, the acoustic pressure was reconstructed using the k-space time reversal technique. the simulations were ran in 3d to produce the photoacoustic tomogram of a brain tumour. the results demonstrate the convergence of the models, and their suitability for investigating the photoacoustic imaging process."
