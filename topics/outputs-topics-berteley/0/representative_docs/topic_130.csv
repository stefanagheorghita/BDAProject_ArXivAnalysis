"multidark simulations: the story of dark matter halo concentrations and density profiles. accurately predicting structural properties of dark matter halos is one of the fundamental goals of modern cosmology. we use the new suite of multidark cosmological simulations to study the evolution of dark matter halo density profiles, concentrations, and velocity anisotropies. the multidark simulations cover a large range of masses 1e10-1e15msun and volumes upto 50gpc**3. the total number of dark matter halos in all the simulations exceeds 60 billion. we find that in order to understand the structure of dark matter halos and to make ~1% accurate predictions for density profiles, one needs to realize that halo concentration is more complex than the traditional ratio of the virial radius to the core radius in the nfw profile. for massive halos the averge density profile is far from the nfw shape and the concentration is defined by both the core radius and the shape parameter alpha in the einasto approximation. combining results from different redshifts, masses and cosmologies, we show that halos progress through three stages of evolution. (1) they start as rare density peaks that experience very fast and nearly radial infall. this radial infall brings mass closer to the center producing a high concentrated halo. here, the halo concentration increases with the increasing halo mass and the concentration is defined by the alpha parameter with nearly constant core radius. later halos slide into (2) the plateau regime where the accretion becomes less radial, but frequent mergers still affect even the central region. now the concentration does not depend on halo mass. (3) once the rate of accretion slows down, halos move into the domain of declining concentration-mass relation because new accretion piles up mass close to the virial radius while the core radius is staying constant. we provide accurate analytical fits to the numerical results for halo density profiles and concentrations."
"dark matter halos from the inside out. the balance of evidence indicates that individual galaxies and groups or clusters of galaxies are embedded in enormous distributions of cold, weakly interacting dark matter. these dark matter 'halos' provide the scaffolding for all luminous structure in the universe, and their properties comprise an essential part of the current cosmological model. i review the internal properties of dark matter halos, focussing on the simple, universal trends predicted by numerical simulations of structure formation. simulations indicate that halos should all have roughly the same spherically-averaged density profile and kinematic structure, and predict simple distributions of shape, formation history and substructure in density and kinematics, over an enormous range of halo mass and for all common variants of the concordance cosmology. i describe observational progress towards testing these predictions by measuring masses, shapes, profiles and substructure in real halos, using baryonic tracers or gravitational lensing. an important property of simulated halos (possibly the most important property) is their dynamical 'age', or degree of internal relaxation. the age of a halo may have almost as much effect as its mass in determining the state of its baryonic contents, so halo ages are also worth trying to measure observationally. i review recent gravitational lensing studies of galaxy clusters which should measure substructure and relaxation in a large sample of individual cluster halos, producing quantitative measures of age that are well-matched to theoretical predictions. the age distributions inferred from these studies will lead to second-generation tests of the cosmological model, as well as an improved understanding of cluster assembly and the evolution of galaxies within clusters."
"the role of galaxy formation in the structure and dynamics of dark matter halos. the structure and dynamics of dark matter halos, as predicted by the hierarchical clustering scenario, are at odds with the properties inferred from the observations at galactic scales. my thesis addresses this problem by taking an evolutionary approach. i analysed in detail the many and different observational evidences of a discrepancy the predicted halo equilibrium state and the one inferred from the measurable properties of disk galaxies, as well as of the scaling relations existing between the angular momentum, geometry and mass distribution of the luminous and dark components, and realized that they all seem to point towards the same conclusion: the baryons hosted inside the halo, by collapsing and assembling to form the galaxy, perturb the halo equilibrium structure and made it evolve into new configurations. from the theoretical point of view, the behaviour of dark matter halos as collisionless systems of particles makes their equilibrium structure and mass distribution extremely sensitive to perturbations of their inner dynamics. the galaxy formation occurring inside the halos is a tremendous event, and the dynamical coupling between the baryons and the dark matter during the protogalaxy collapse represents a perturbation of the halo dynamical structure large enough to trigger a halo evolution, according to the relative mass and angular momentum of the two components. my conclusion is that the structure and dynamics of dark matter halos, as well as the origin of the connection between the halo and galaxy properties, are to be understood in in terms of a joint evolution of the baryonic and dark components, originating at the epoch of the collapse and formation of the galaxy."
