"mean-field games with common poissonian noise: a maximum principle approach. the theory of mean-field games is interested in the behaviour of interacting particle systems in which the individual interaction between particles (players) decreases as the size of the population increases. in recent years, it was introduced an interesting structure for this type of games, assuming a correlated continuous source of randomness, which are called mean-field games with common noise. in this paper, we extend this concept and provide a precise definition of a mean-field game with common poissoninan noise and its equilibrium. that is, a common self-exciting poissonian structure is considered within the dynamics of the population. then, we address the problem of optimization for jump-diffusions with random environments that lies within the definition of the mfg, and develop a stochastic version of the pontryagin's maximum principle to obtain a set of necessary conditions that an optimal control must satisfy. under additional convexity assumptions it is also shown that these conditions are also sufficient."
"a quadratic mean field games model for the langevin equation. we consider a mean field games model where the dynamics of the agents is given by a controlled langevin equation and the cost is quadratic. a change of variables, introduced in [9], transforms the mean field games system into a system of two coupled kinetic fokker-planck equations. we prove an existence result for the latter system, obtaining consequently existence of a solution for the mean field games system."
"a probabilistic approach to extended finite state mean field games. we develop a probabilistic approach to continuous-time finite state mean field games. based on an alternative description of continuous-time markov chain by means of semimartingale and the weak formulation of stochastic optimal control, our approach not only allows us to tackle the mean field of states and the mean field of control in the same time, but also extend the strategy set of players from markov strategies to closed-loop strategies. we show the existence and uniqueness of nash equilibrium for the mean field game, as well as how the equilibrium of mean field game consists of an approximative nash equilibrium for the game with finite number of players under different assumptions of structure and regularity on the cost functions and transition rate between states."
