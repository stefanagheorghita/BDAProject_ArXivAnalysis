"defect configuration of an active nematic around a circular obstacle. nematic liquid crystal is a complex fluid whose constituents have an anisotropic shape and exhibit orientational order. a class of active matter which exhibits orientational order, e.g., cell populations, is called active nematic. a singularity of the orientational field, called a topological defect, is a robust structure which cannot be removed by continuum deformations. this robustness plays an important role in, e.g., the process of morphogenesis. to enhance the understanding of the behavior of active nematic, it is important to understand the behavior of topological defects. in this paper, we study the configuration of topological defects of a two-dimensional active nematic around a circular obstacle. in the case of a passive nematic liquid crystal, the equilibrium configuration of defects can be easily identified by the method of image charges. in the case of an active nematic, however, one must take account of the flow field generated by active constituents, and the problem of identifying the defect configuration becomes complicated. in this study, we perform numerical simulations and investigate how the stationary defect configuration deviates from the passive case. furthermore, we carry out a theoretical calculation based on an analytical expression relating the defect velocity with the force exerted on the defect. our theoretical calculation qualitatively reproduces the simulation results. our study may be applied to describing the behaviour of e.g. cell populations in the presence of obstacles, and has the potential to benefit related fields, e.g., developmental biology."
"topological defects and geometric memory across the nematic-smectic a liquid crystal phase transition. we study transformations of self-organized defect arrays at the nematic-smectic a liquid crystal phase transition, and show that these defect configurations are correlated, or ""remembered"", across the phase transition. a thin film of thermotropic liquid crystal is subjected to hybrid anchoring by an air interface and a water substrate, and viewed under polarized optical microscopy. upon heating from smectic-a to nematic, a packing of focal conic domains melts into a dense array of boojums---nematic surface defects---which then coarsens by pair-annihilation. with the aid of landau-de gennes numerical modeling, we elucidate the topological and geometrical rules underlying this transformation. in the transition from nematic to smectic-a, we show that focal conic domain packings are organized over large scales in patterns that retain a geometric memory of the nematic boojum configuration, which can be recovered with remarkable fidelity."
"active nematic-isotropic interfaces on flat surfaces: effects of anchoring, ordering field and activity. a surface in contact with the isotropic phase of a passive liquid crystal can induce nematic order over distances that range from microscopic to macroscopic when the nematic-isotropic interface undergoes an orientational-wetting transition. if the nematic is active, what happens to the interface? does it propagate and, if it does, is its structure different from the passive one? in this paper, we address these questions. we investigate how the active nematic-isotropic interface is affected by the anchoring strength of the surface, the bulk ordering field and the activity. we find that while passive interfaces are one-dimensional the active ones exhibit two dynamical regimes: a passive-like regime and a propagating regime where the interfaces propagate until the entire domain is active nematic. active interfaces break the translational symmetry within the interfacial plane above a threshold activity, where the active nematic fluctuations, which are ultimately responsible for the emergence of an active turbulent nematic phase, drive non-steady dynamical interfacial regimes."
