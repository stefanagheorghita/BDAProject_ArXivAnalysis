"anderson localization in dissipative lattices. anderson localization predicts that wave spreading in disordered lattices can come to a complete halt, providing a universal mechanism for {dynamical localization}. in the one-dimensional hermitian anderson model with uncorrelated diagonal disorder, there is a one-to-one correspondence between dynamical localization and spectral localization, i.e. the exponential localization of all the hamiltonian eigenfunctions. this correspondence can be broken when dealing with disordered dissipative lattices. recently, it has been shown that when the system exchanges particles with the surrounding environment and random fluctuations of the dissipation are introduced, spectral localization is observed but without dynamical localization. such previous studies considered lattices with mixed conservative (hamiltonian) and dissipative dynamics, and were restricted to a semiclassical analysis. however, anderson localization in purely dissipative lattices, displaying an entirely lindbladian dynamics, remains largely unexplored. here we consider the purely-dissipative anderson model in the framework of a lindblad master equation and show that, akin to the semiclassical models with conservative hopping and random dissipation, one observes dynamical delocalization in spite of strong spectral localization of all eigenstates of the liouvillian superoperator. this result is very distinct than delocalization observed in the anderson model with dephasing effects, where dynamical delocalization arises from the delocalization of the stationary state of the liouvillian superoperator."
"localization of non-interacting electrons in thin layered disordered systems. localization of electronic states in disordered thin layered systems with b layers is studied within the anderson model of localization using the transfer-matrix method and finite-size scaling of the inverse of the smallest lyapunov exponent. the results support the one-parameter scaling hypothesis for disorder strengths w studied and b=1,...,6. the obtained results for the localization length are in good agreement with both the analytical results of the self-consistent theory of localization and the numerical scaling studies of the two-dimensional anderson model. the localization length near the band center grows exponentially with b for fixed w but no localization-delocalization transition takes place."
"anderson localization induced by structural disorder. we examine the onset of anderson localization in three-dimensional systems with structural disorder in the form of lattice irregularities and in the absence of any on-site disordered potential. analyzing two models with distinct types of lattice regularities, we show that the anderson localization transition occurs when the strength of the structural disorder is smoothly increased. performing finite-size scaling analysis of the results, we show that the transition belongs to the same universality class as regular anderson localization induced by onsite disorder. our work identifies a new class of structurally disordered lattice models in which destructive interference of matter waves may inhibit transport and lead to a transition between metallic and localized phases."
