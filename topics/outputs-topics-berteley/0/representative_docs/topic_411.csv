subfactors and planar algebras. an inclusion of ii$_1$ factors $n \subset m$ with finite jones index gives rise to a powerful set of invariants that can be approached successfully in a number of different ways. we describe jones' pictorial description of the standard invariant of a subfactor as a so-called planar algebra and show how this point of view leads to new structure results for subfactors.
"new hyperfinite subfactors with infinite depth. we construct new hyperfinite subfactors with temperley-lieb-jones (tlj) standard invariant and jones indices between $4$ and $3 + \sqrt{5}$. our subfactors occur at all indices between $4$ and $5$ at which finite depth, hyperfinite subfactors exist. the presence of hyperfinite subfactors with tlj standard invariant, and hence of infinite depth, at these special indices comes as a surprise. in particular, we obtain the first example of a hyperfinite subfactor with ``trivial'' (i.e. tlj) standard invariant and integer index $>4$, namely with index $5$. this is achieved by constructing explicit families of nondegenerate commuting squares of multi-matrix algebras based on exotic inclusion graphs with appropriate norms. we employ our graph planar algebra embedding theorem [bc25], a result of kawahigashi [kaw23] and other techniques to determine that the resulting commuting square subfactors have indeed tlj standard invariant. we also show the existence of a hyperfinite subfactor with trivial standard invariant and index $3 + \sqrt{5}$. it is interesting that this index features at least two distinct infinite depth, irreducible hyperfinite subfactors and several finite depth ones as well. our work leads to the conjecture that every jones index $>4$ of an irreducible, hyperfinite (finite depth) subfactor can be realized by one with tlj standard invariant."
"graph planar algebra embeddings and infinite depth subfactors. subfactors of the hyperfinite ii$_1$ factor with ''exotic'' properties can be constructed from nondegenerate commuting squares of multi-matrix algebras. we show that the subfactor planar algebra of these commuting square subfactors necessarily embeds into jones' graph planar algebra associated to one of the inclusion graphs in the commuting square. this leads to a powerful obstruction for the standard invariant of the subfactor, and we use it to give an example of a hyperfinite subfactor with temperley-lieb-jones standard invariant and index $\frac{5+\sqrt{13}}{2}$, i.e. the index of the haagerup subfactor. we are led to a conjecture pertaining to jones indices of irreducible, hyperfinite subfactors."
