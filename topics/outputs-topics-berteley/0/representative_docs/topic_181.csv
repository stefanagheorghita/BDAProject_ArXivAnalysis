"constraints on the origins of the galactic neutrino flux. galactic and extragalactic objects in the universe are sources of high-energy neutrinos {that may contribute to the astrophysical neutrino signal seen by icecube.} recently, a study done using cascade-like events seen by icecube reported neutrino emission from the galactic plane with $>$4$\sigma$ significance. in this work, we put a lower limit on the number of galactic sources required to explain this emission. to achieve this, we {use} a simulation package created to simulate point sources in the galaxy along with the neutrino and gamma-ray flux emissions originating from them. along with {using} past icecube discovery potential curves, we also account for eddington bias effects due to poisson fluctuations in the number of detected neutrino events.{we present a toy monte carlo simulation to show that there should be at least 8 sources, each with luminosities $1.6 \times 10^{35}$erg/s responsible for the galactic neutrino emission. } our results constrain the number of individual point-like emission regions, which applies both to discrete astrophysical sources and to individual points of diffuse emission."
"exploring the universe with neutrinos: recent results from icecube. in 2013, the icecube neutrino observatory located at the geographic south pole detected evidence for a diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux above ~60 tev. to this day, icecube has operated with full detector configuration for more than 6 years. the observed astrophysical neutrino flux has been confirmed with > 6$\sigma$ significance with both events starting within the detector (all flavor) and events traversing through the earth ($\nu_{\mu}$ charged-current). somewhat equal flavor ratio of astrophysical neutrinos is expected at earth assuming standard thorough oscillation. a search for tau neutrinos has been carried out but yielded null result. no neutrino sources have been found to contribute significantly to the diffuse flux at this point. in this paper, we will review the current status of the astrophysical neutrino flux, discuss the quest for neutrino point sources and overview the proposed design and physics potentials of the future icecube-gen2."
"search for astrophysical tau neutrinos with icecube. high-energy (tev-pev) cosmic neutrinos are expected to be produced in extremely energetic astrophysical sources such as active galactic nuclei. the icecube neutrino observatory at the south pole has recently detected a diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux. while the flux is consistent with all flavors of neutrinos being present, identification of tau neutrinos within the flux is yet to occur. although tau neutrino production is thought to be low at the source, an equal fraction of neutrinos are expected at earth due to averaged neutrino oscillations over astronomical distances. above a few hundred tev, tau neutrinos become resolvable in icecube with negligible background from cosmic-ray induced atmospheric neutrinos. identification of tau neutrinos within the observed flux is crucial to precise measurement of its flavor content, which could serve to test fundamental neutrino properties over extremely long baselines, and possibly shed light on new physics beyond the standard model. we present the analysis method and results from a recent search for astrophysical tau neutrinos in three years of icecube data."
