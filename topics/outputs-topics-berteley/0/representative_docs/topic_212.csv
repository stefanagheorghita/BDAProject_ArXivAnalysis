"multiple scattering limit in optical microscopy. optical microscopy offers a unique insight of biological structures with a sub-micrometer resolution and a minimum invasiveness. however, the inhomogeneities of the specimen itself can induce multiple scattering of light and optical aberrations which limit the observation to depths close to the surface. to predict quantitatively the penetration depth in microscopy, we theoretically derive the single-to-multiple scattering ratio in reflection. from this key quantity, the multiple scattering limit is deduced for various microscopic imaging techniques such as confocal microscopy, optical coherence tomography and related methods."
"phase-sensitive fluorescent imaging with coherent reconstruction. optical imaging plays a critical role in advancing our understanding of three dimensional dynamics of biological systems. coherent imaging (ci) methods exploit spatial phase information, encoded through propagation of coherent signal light emerging from a specimen, to extract a three-dimensional representation of the object from a single high-speed measurement. until now, ci methods could not be applied to incoherent light, severely limiting their ability to image the most powerful biological probes available - fluorescent molecules - with sufficient speed and volume to observe important processes, such as neural processing in live specimens. we introduce a new imaging technique that transfers the spatial propagation phase of coherent illumination light to incoherent fluorescent light emission. the transfer of propagation phase allows ci techniques to be applied to fluorescent light imaging, and leads to large increases in imaging speed and depth of field. with this advance, biological imaging of fluorescent molecules is significantly expanded."
"full-wave simulations of tomographic optical imaging inside scattering media. label-free tomographic optical imaging inside scattering media is important for medical diagnosis, biological science, colloidal physics, and device inspection. an outstanding challenge is that the ground-truth structure is often unknown, so one cannot rigorously assess and compare different imaging schemes. here we demonstrate full-wave simulations of tomographic optical imaging deep inside scattering media, which provide not only the ground truth but also the flexibility to tailor the structure and the convenience of comparing different imaging schemes in the same virtual setup with minimal cost. we model reflectance confocal microscopy, optical coherence tomography, optical coherence microscopy, interferometric synthetic aperture microscopy, and the recently proposed scattering matrix tomography for imaging nanoparticle targets embedded in a large scattering medium. the ground truth enables the identification of artifacts that would typically be mistaken as being correct while setting a rigorous and uniform standard across different methods. this work shows how full-wave simulations can fill the gaps of experiments for studying imaging inside scattering media."
