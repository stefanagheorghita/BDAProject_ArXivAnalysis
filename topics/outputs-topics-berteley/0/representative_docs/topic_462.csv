"query-specific variable depth pooling via query performance prediction towards reducing relevance assessment effort. due to the massive size of test collections, a standard practice in ir evaluation is to construct a 'pool' of candidate relevant documents comprised of the top-k documents retrieved by a wide range of different retrieval systems - a process called depth-k pooling. a standard practice is to set the depth (k) to a constant value for each query constituting the benchmark set. however, in this paper we argue that the annotation effort can be substantially reduced if the depth of the pool is made a variable quantity for each query, the rationale being that the number of documents relevant to the information need can widely vary across queries. our hypothesis is that a lower depth for the former class of queries and a higher depth for the latter can potentially reduce the annotation effort without a significant change in retrieval effectiveness evaluation. we make use of standard query performance prediction (qpp) techniques to estimate the number of potentially relevant documents for each query, which is then used to determine the depth of the pool. our experiments conducted on standard test collections demonstrate that this proposed method of employing query-specific variable depths is able to adequately reflect the relative effectiveness of ir systems with a substantially smaller annotation effort."
"evaluating elements of web-based data enrichment for pseudo-relevance feedback retrieval. in this work, we analyze a pseudo-relevance retrieval method based on the results of web search engines. by enriching topics with text data from web search engine result pages and linked contents, we train topic-specific and cost-efficient classifiers that can be used to search test collections for relevant documents. building upon attempts initially made at trec common core 2018 by grossman and cormack, we address questions of system performance over time considering different search engines, queries, and test collections. our experimental results show how and to which extent the considered components affect the retrieval performance. overall, the analyzed method is robust in terms of average retrieval performance and a promising way to use web content for the data enrichment of relevance feedback methods."
"evaluation of query generators for entity search engines. dynamic web applications such as mashups need efficient access to web data that is only accessible via entity search engines (e.g. product or publication search engines). however, most current mashup systems and applications only support simple keyword searches for retrieving data from search engines. we propose the use of more powerful search strategies building on so-called query generators. for a given set of entities query generators are able to automatically determine a set of search queries to retrieve these entities from an entity search engine. we demonstrate the usefulness of query generators for on-demand web data integration and evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of query generators for a challenging real-world integration scenario."
