"detecting isolated stellar-mass black holes in the absence of microlensing parallax effect. gravitational microlensing can detect isolated stellar-mass black holes (bhs), which are believed to be the dominant form of galactic bhs according to population synthesis models. previous searches for bh events in microlensing data focused on long-timescale events with significant microlensing parallax detections. here we show that, although bh events preferentially have long timescales, the microlensing parallax amplitudes are so small that in most cases the parallax signals cannot be detected statistically significantly. we then identify ogle-2006-blg-044 to be a candidate bh event because of its long timescale and small microlensing parallax. our findings have implications to future bh searches in microlensing data."
"an extrasolar planet census with a space-based microlensing survey. a space-based gravitational microlensing exoplanet survey will provide a statistical census of exoplanets with masses down to 0.1 earth-masses and orbital separations ranging from 0.5au to infinity. this includes analogs to all the solar system's planets except for mercury, as well as most types of planets predicted by planet formation theories. such a survey will provide results on the frequency of planets around all types of stars except those with short lifetimes. close-in planets with separations < 0.5 au are invisible to a space-based microlensing survey, but these can be found by kepler. other methods, including ground-based microlensing, cannot approach the comprehensive statistics on the mass and semi-major axis distribution of extrasolar planets that a space-based microlensing survey will provide. the terrestrial planet sensitivity of a ground-based microlensing survey is limited to the vicinity of the einstein radius at 2-3 au, and space-based imaging is needed to identify and determine the mass of the planetary host stars for the vast majority of planets discovered by microlensing. thus, a space-based microlensing survey is likely to be the only way to gain a comprehensive understanding of the nature of planetary systems, which is needed to understand planet formation and habitability. the proposed microlensing planet finder (mpf) mission is an example of a space-based microlensing survey that can accomplish these objectives with proven technology and a cost that fits comfortably under the nasa discovery program cost cap."
"microlensing planets in the light of the second data release of gaia. extrasolar planets found by gravitational microlensing often require assumptions on the source star distance and relative proper motion. only in a few cases has it been possible to confirm these findings with space-based observations or high-resolution follow-up. 20 planetary microlensing events can be positionally cross-matched with the second gaia data release containing parallax and proper motion measurements. in this work we subject all microlensing planets listed in nasa's exoplanet archive to an initial consistency check by comparing them with gaia data release 2 measurements. the resulting list is supposed to serve as a reference for the observers in the microlensing community. gravitational microlensing can constrain the physical parameters lens mass and lens distance based on fit parameters, such as the event timescale, the microlensing parallax, and the source star crossing time. if some of these parameters are not available, one needs to resort to indirect means of assessing the events, often involving a galactic model. in this work, we seek to make an initial assessment of those parameters solely based on gaia dr2. we find that 19 of 20 planetary events are consistent within $2\,\sigma$ of their published lens and source distances, whereas 9 of them agree with their published source magnitude within $0.2\,\mathrm{mag}$. the only event that does not seem to be compatible with the reported distance, is well-constrained and provides plausible distance estimates."
