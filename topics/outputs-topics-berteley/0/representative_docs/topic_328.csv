sentiment/subjectivity analysis survey for languages other than english. subjective and sentiment analysis have gained considerable attention recently. most of the resources and systems built so far are done for english. the need for designing systems for other languages is increasing. this paper surveys different ways used for building systems for subjective and sentiment analysis for languages other than english. there are three different types of systems used for building these systems. the first (and the best) one is the language specific systems. the second type of systems involves reusing or transferring sentiment resources from english to the target language. the third type of methods is based on using language independent methods. the paper presents a separate section devoted to arabic sentiment analysis.
"sentiment analysis based on deep learning: a comparative study. the study of public opinion can provide us with valuable information. the analysis of sentiment on social networks, such as twitter or facebook, has become a powerful means of learning about the users' opinions and has a wide range of applications. however, the efficiency and accuracy of sentiment analysis is being hindered by the challenges encountered in natural language processing (nlp). in recent years, it has been demonstrated that deep learning models are a promising solution to the challenges of nlp. this paper reviews the latest studies that have employed deep learning to solve sentiment analysis problems, such as sentiment polarity. models using term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) and word embedding have been applied to a series of datasets. finally, a comparative study has been conducted on the experimental results obtained for the different models and input features"
"learning to extract cross-domain aspects and understanding sentiments using large language models. aspect-based sentiment analysis (asba) is a refined approach to sentiment analysis that aims to extract and classify sentiments based on specific aspects or features of a product, service, or entity. unlike traditional sentiment analysis, which assigns a general sentiment score to entire reviews or texts, absa focuses on breaking down the text into individual components or aspects (e.g., quality, price, service) and evaluating the sentiment towards each. this allows for a more granular level of understanding of customer opinions, enabling businesses to pinpoint specific areas of strength and improvement. the process involves several key steps, including aspect extraction, sentiment classification, and aspect-level sentiment aggregation for a review paragraph or any other form that the users have provided. absa has significant applications in areas such as product reviews, social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and market research. by leveraging techniques from natural language processing (nlp) and machine learning, absa facilitates the extraction of valuable insights, enabling companies to make data-driven decisions that enhance customer satisfaction and optimize offerings. as absa evolves, it holds the potential to greatly improve personalized customer experiences by providing a deeper understanding of sentiment across various product aspects. in this work, we have analyzed the strength of llms for a complete cross-domain aspect-based sentiment analysis with the aim of defining the framework for certain products and using it for other similar situations. we argue that it is possible to that at an effectiveness of 92\% accuracy for the aspect based sentiment analysis dataset of semeval-2015 task 12."
