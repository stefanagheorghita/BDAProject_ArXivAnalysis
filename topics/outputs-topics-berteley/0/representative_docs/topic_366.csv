"detecting and grouping identical objects for region proposal and classification. often multiple instances of an object occur in the same scene, for example in a warehouse. unsupervised multi-instance object discovery algorithms are able to detect and identify such objects. we use such an algorithm to provide object proposals to a convolutional neural network (cnn) based classifier. this results in fewer regions to evaluate, compared to traditional region proposal algorithms. additionally, it enables using the joint probability of multiple instances of an object, resulting in improved classification accuracy. the proposed technique can also split a single class into multiple sub-classes corresponding to the different object types, enabling hierarchical classification."
"learning structure-aware semantic segmentation with image-level supervision. compared with expensive pixel-wise annotations, image-level labels make it possible to learn semantic segmentation in a weakly-supervised manner. within this pipeline, the class activation map (cam) is obtained and further processed to serve as a pseudo label to train the semantic segmentation model in a fully-supervised manner. in this paper, we argue that the lost structure information in cam limits its application in downstream semantic segmentation, leading to deteriorated predictions. furthermore, the inconsistent class activation scores inside the same object contradicts the common sense that each region of the same object should belong to the same semantic category. to produce sharp prediction with structure information, we introduce an auxiliary semantic boundary detection module, which penalizes the deteriorated predictions. furthermore, we adopt smoothness loss to encourage prediction inside the object to be consistent. experimental results on the pascal-voc dataset illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution."
"pixelwise instance segmentation with a dynamically instantiated network. semantic segmentation and object detection research have recently achieved rapid progress. however, the former task has no notion of different instances of the same object, and the latter operates at a coarse, bounding-box level. we propose an instance segmentation system that produces a segmentation map where each pixel is assigned an object class and instance identity label. most approaches adapt object detectors to produce segments instead of boxes. in contrast, our method is based on an initial semantic segmentation module, which feeds into an instance subnetwork. this subnetwork uses the initial category-level segmentation, along with cues from the output of an object detector, within an end-to-end crf to predict instances. this part of our model is dynamically instantiated to produce a variable number of instances per image. our end-to-end approach requires no post-processing and considers the image holistically, instead of processing independent proposals. therefore, unlike some related work, a pixel cannot belong to multiple instances. furthermore, far more precise segmentations are achieved, as shown by our state-of-the-art results (particularly at high iou thresholds) on the pascal voc and cityscapes datasets."
