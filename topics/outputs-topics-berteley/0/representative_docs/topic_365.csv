"quantum spin liquid ground state in a rare-earth triangular antiferromagnet smta$_7$o$_{19}$. the rare-earth-based geometrically frustrated triangular magnets have attracted considerable attention due to the intricate interplay between strong spin-orbit coupling and the crystal electric field (cef), which often leads to effective spin-1/2 degrees of freedom and therefore promotes strong quantum fluctuations at low temperatures, thus offering an excellent route to stabilize a quantum spin liquid (qsl) ground state. we have investigated the ground state magnetic properties of a polycrystalline sample of $\text{smta}_7\text{o}_{19}$ which we propose to have a gapless qsl ground state by employing powder x-ray diffraction (xrd), x-ray absorption spectroscopy (xas), dc and ac-magnetic susceptibility, $m$ vs. $h$ isotherm, specific heat, and muon spin rotation/relaxation measurements ($\mu$sr) down to 30 mk. the combined structural and electronic studies reveal the formation of an edge-sharing equilateral triangular lattice of sm$^{3+}$ ions in $ab$ plane. the dc, ac magnetic susceptibility, and heat capacity measurements reveal that $\text{smta}_7\text{o}_{19}$ does not exhibit any long-range magnetic ordering transition down to 50 mk. the zero-field (zf)-$\mu$sr study strongly refutes the long-range magnetically ordered ground state and/or any partial spin-freezing down to at least 30 mk. the zf-muon-spin relaxation rate is weakly temperature dependent between 50 and 20 k, rapidly increases below $\sim$20 k and saturates at low temperatures between 2 k and 30 mk, which has been attributed to a characteristic signature of qsl systems. further, our longitudinal-field (lf)-$\mu$sr measurements at 0.1 k reveal a dynamic nature of the magnetic ground state. in addition, our high-field specific heat data suggest a gapless nature of spin excitations in this compound."
"honeycomb-structure rui3, a new quantum material related to {\alpha}-rucl3. the kitaev model predicts that quantum spin liquids (qsls) will form at low temperatures under certain special conditions, and materials hosting the qsl state are frequently sought. the layered honeycomb lattice material {\alpha}-rucl3 has emerged as a prime candidate for displaying the kitaev qsl state. here we describe a new polymorph of rui3 with a layered honeycomb lattice structure, synthesized at moderately high pressures and stable under ambient conditions. preliminary characterization reveals metallic, paramagnetic behavior, the absence of long-range magnetic order down to 0.35 k and an unusually large t-linear contribution to the heat capacity at low temperatures. we propose that this rui3 phase, with a layered honeycomb lattice and strong spin-orbit coupling, provides a new route for the characterization of quantum materials."
"scale-invariant magnetic anisotropy in rucl$_3$ at high magnetic fields. in rucl$_3$, inelastic neutron scattering and raman spectroscopy reveal a continuum of non-spin-wave excitations that persists to high temperature, suggesting the presence of a spin liquid state on a honeycomb lattice. in the context of the kitaev model, magnetic fields introduce finite interactions between the elementary excitations, and thus the effects of high magnetic fields - comparable to the spin exchange energy scale - must be explored. here we report measurements of the magnetotropic coefficient - the second derivative of the free energy with respect to magnetic field orientation - over a wide range of magnetic fields and temperatures. we find that magnetic field and temperature compete to determine the magnetic response in a way that is independent of the large intrinsic exchange interaction energy. this emergent scale-invariant magnetic anisotropy provides evidence for a high degree of exchange frustration that favors the formation of a spin liquid state in rucl$_3$."
