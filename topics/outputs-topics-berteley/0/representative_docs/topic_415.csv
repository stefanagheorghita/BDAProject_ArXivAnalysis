"measures of maximal entropy for suspension flows. we study suspension flows defined over sub-shifts of finite type with continuous roof functions. we prove the existence of suspension flows with uncountably many ergodic measures of maximal entropy. more generally, we prove that any suspension flow defined over a sub-shift of finite type can be perturbed (by an arbitrarily small perturbation) so that the resulting flow has uncountably many ergodic measures of maximal entropy, and that the same can be arranged so that the new flow has a unique measure of maximal entropy."
"nonhyperbolic step skew-products: ergodic approximation. we study transitive step skew-product maps modeled over a complete shift of $k$, $k\ge2$, symbols whose fiber maps are defined on the circle and have intermingled contracting and expanding regions. these dynamics are genuinely nonhyperbolic and exhibit simultaneously ergodic measures with positive, negative, and zero exponents. we introduce a set of axioms for the fiber maps and study the dynamics of the resulting skew-product. these axioms turn out to capture the key mechanisms of the dynamics of nonhyperbolic robustly transitive maps with compact central leaves. focusing on the nonhyperbolic ergodic measures (with zero fiber exponent) of these systems, we prove that such measures are approximated in the weak$\ast$ topology and in entropy by hyperbolic ones. we also prove that they are in the intersection of the convex hulls of the measures with positive fiber exponent and with negative fiber exponent. our methods also allow us to perturb hyperbolic measures. we can perturb a measure with negative exponent directly to a measure with positive exponent (and vice-versa), however we lose some amount of entropy in this process. the loss of entropy is determined by the difference between the lyapunov exponents of the measures."
"measures of maximal entropy for suspension flows over the full shift. we consider suspension flows with continuous roof function over the full shift $\sigma$ on a finite alphabet. for any positive entropy subshift of finite type $y \subset \sigma$, we explictly construct a roof function such that the measure(s) of maximal entropy for the suspension flow over $\sigma$ are exactly the lifts of the measure(s) of maximal entropy for $y$. in the case when $y$ is transitive, this gives a unique measure of maximal entropy for the flow which is not fully supported. if $y$ has more than one transitive component, all with the same entropy, this gives explicit examples of suspension flows over the full shift with multiple measures of maximal entropy. this contrasts with the case of a h\""older continuous roof function where it is well known the measure of maximal entropy is unique and fully supported."
