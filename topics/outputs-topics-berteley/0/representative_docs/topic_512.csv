"laser cooling to quantum degeneracy. we report on bose-einstein condensation (bec) in a gas of strontium atoms, using laser cooling as the only cooling mechanism. the condensate is formed within a sample that is continuously doppler cooled to below 1\muk on a narrow-linewidth transition. the critical phase-space density for bec is reached in a central region of the sample, in which atoms are rendered transparent for laser cooling photons. the density in this region is enhanced by an additional dipole trap potential. thermal equilibrium between the gas in this central region and the surrounding laser cooled part of the cloud is established by elastic collisions. condensates of up to 10^5 atoms can be repeatedly formed on a timescale of 100ms, with prospects for the generation of a continuous atom laser."
"accessing the topological mott insulator in cold atom quantum simulators with realistic rydberg dressing. the interplay between many-body interactions and the kinetic energy gives rise to rich phase diagrams hosting, among others, interaction-induced topological phases. these phases are characterized by both a local order parameter and a global topological invariant, and can exhibit exotic ground states such as self-trapped polarons and interaction-induced edge states. in this work, we investigate a realistic scenario for the quantum simulation of such systems using cold rydberg-dressed atoms in optical lattices. we consider spinless fermions on a checkerboard lattice, interacting via the tunable-range effective potential induced by the rydberg dressing. we perform a detailed analysis of the phase diagram at half- and incommensurate fillings, in the mean-field approximation. we furthermore study the stability of the phases with respect to temperature within the mean-field approximation and with respect to quantum fluctuations using the density matrix renormalization group method. finally, we propose an implementation protocol, and in particular identify attainable regimes of experimental parameters in which the topological properties of the model become accessible. our work, thereby, opens a realistic pathway to the outstanding experimental observation of this predicted phase in state-of-the-art cold atom quantum simulators."
"coherence and linewidth of a continuously pumped atom laser at finite temperature. a continuous wave atom laser formed by the outcoupling of atoms from a trapped bose-einstein condensate (bec) potentially has a range of metrological applications. however, in order for the device to be truly continuous, a mechanism to replenish the atoms in the bec is required. here we calculate the temporal coherence properties of a continuously pumped atom laser beam outcoupled from a trapped bose-einstein condensate which is replenished from a reservoir at finite temperature. we find that the thermal fluctuations of the condensate can significantly decrease the temporal coherence of the output beam due to atomic interactions between the trapped bec and the beam, and this can impact the metrological usefulness of the device. we demonstrate that a raman outcoupling scheme imparting a sufficient momentum kick to the atom laser beam can lead to a significantly reduced linewidth."
