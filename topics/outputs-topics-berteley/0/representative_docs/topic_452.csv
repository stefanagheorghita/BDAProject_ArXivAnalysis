extremal betti numbers of some classes of binomial edge ideals. let $g$ be a cycle or a complete bipartite graph. we show that the binomial edge ideal $j_{g}$ and its initial ideal with respect to the lexicographic order have the same extremal betti number.
"(generalized) binomial edge ideals and their regularity. in this article, we survey the recent results on the castelnuovo-mumford regularity of binomial edge ideals and generalized binomial edge ideals. we also generalize some of the known upper bounds for binomial edge ideals to the case of generalized binomial edge ideals."
"splittings of monomial ideals. we provide some new conditions under which the graded betti numbers of a monomial ideal can be computed in terms of the graded betti numbers of smaller ideals, thus complementing eliahou and kervaire's splitting approach. as applications, we show that edge ideals of graphs are splittable, and we provide an iterative method for computing the betti numbers of the cover ideals of cohen-macaulay bipartite graphs. finally, we consider the frequency with which one can find particular splittings of monomial ideals and raise questions about ideals whose resolutions are characteristic-dependent."
