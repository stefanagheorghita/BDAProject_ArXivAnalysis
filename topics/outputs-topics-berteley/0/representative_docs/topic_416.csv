"quenched poisson processes for random subshifts of finite type. in this paper we study the quenched distributions of hitting times for a class of random dynamical systems. we prove that hitting times to dynamically defined cylinders converge to a poisson point process under the law of random equivariant measures with super-polynomial decay of correlations. in particular, we apply our results to uniformly aperiodic random subshifts of finite type equipped with random invariant gibbs measures. we emphasize that we make no assumptions about the mixing property of the marginal measure."
"scaling limits of stationary determinantal shot-noise fields. we consider a shot-noise field defined on a stationary determinantal point process on $\mathbb{r}^d$ associated with i.i.d. amplitudes and a bounded response function, for which we investigate the scaling limits as the intensity of the point process goes to infinity. specifically, we show that the centralized and suitably scaled shot-noise field converges in finite dimensional distributions to i) a gaussian random field when the amplitudes have the finite second moment and ii) an $\alpha$-stable random field when the amplitudes follow a regularly varying distribution with index $-\alpha$ for $\alpha\in(1,2)$. we first prove the corresponding results for the shot-noise field defined on a homogeneous poisson point process and then extend them to the one defined on a stationary determinantal point process."
"brownian loops, layering fields and imaginary gaussian multiplicative chaos. we study vertex-like operators built from the brownian loop soup in the limit as the loop soup intensity tends to infinity. more precisely, following camia, gandolfi and kleban (nuclear physics b 902, 2016), we take a brownian loop soup in a planar domain and assign a random sign to each loop. we then consider random fields defined by taking, at every point of the domain, the exponential of a purely imaginary constant times the sum of the signs associated to the loops that wind around that point. as smaller loops are included in the count, that sum diverges logarithmically with the diameter of the loops, but we show that a suitable renormalization procedure allows to define the fields in an appropriate sobolev space. subsequently, we let the intensity of the loop soup tend to infinity and prove that these vertex-like fields tend to a conformally covariant random field which can be expressed as an explicit functional of the imaginary gaussian multiplicative chaos with covariance kernel given by the brownian loop measure. besides using properties of the brownian loop soup and the brownian loop measure, a main tool in our analysis is an explicit wiener-it\^{o} chaos expansion of linear functionals of vertex-like fields."
