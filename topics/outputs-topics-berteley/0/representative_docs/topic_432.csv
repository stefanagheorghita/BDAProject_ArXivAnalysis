"a new susceptible-infectious (si) model with endemic equilibrium. the focus of this article is on the dynamics of a new susceptible-infected model which consists of a susceptible group ($s$) and two different infectious groups ($i_1$ and $i_2$). once infected, an individual becomes a member of one of these infectious groups which have different clinical forms of infection. in addition, during the progress of the illness, an infected individual in group $i_1$ may pass to the infectious group $i_2$ which has a higher mortality rate. in this study, positiveness of the solutions for the model is proved. stability analysis of species extinction, $i_1$-free equilibrium and endemic equilibrium as well as disease-free equilibrium is studied. relation between the basic reproduction number of the disease and the basic reproduction number of each infectious stage is examined. the model is investigated under a specific condition and its exact solution is obtained."
"qualitative properties of spatial epidemiological models. we study the qualitative properties of a spatial diffusive heterogeneous sir model, that appears in mathematical epidemiology to describe the spread of an infectious disease in a population. the model we consider consists in a system of parabolic pdes. in the first part of the paper, we give a criterion that ensures whether or not an epidemic propagates in a given population. we show how the features of the disease and of the population (rates of infection and of recovery, localisation and diffusivity of individuals) influence the propagation of the epidemic. in particular, we prove that there are situations where ""slowing down"" the individuals can trigger an epidemic that would not propagate otherwise. in the second part of the paper, we show how the spatial diffusive sir model qualitatively differs from the usual, purely temporal, sir model."
"moderate deviations and extinction of an epidemic. consider an epidemic model with a constant flux of susceptibles, in a situation where the corresponding deterministic epidemic model has a unique stable endemic equilibrium. for the associated stochastic model, whose law of large numbers limit is the deterministic model, the disease free equilibrium is an absorbing state, which is reached soon or later by the process. however, for a large population size, i.e. when the stochastic model is close to its deterministic limit, the time needed for the stochastic perturbations to stop the epidemic may be enormous. in this paper, we discuss how the central limit theorem, moderate and large deviations allow us to give estimates of the extinction time of the epidemic, depending upon the size of the population."
