"evolving boolean regulatory networks with variable gene expression times. the time taken for gene expression varies not least because proteins vary in length considerably. this paper uses an abstract, tuneable boolean regulatory network model to explore gene expression time variation. in particular, it is shown how non-uniform expression times can emerge under certain conditions through simulated evolution. that is, gene expression time variance appears beneficial in the shaping of the dynamical behaviour of the regulatory network without explicit consideration of protein function."
"noise-based switches and amplifiers for gene expression. the regulation of cellular function is often controlled at the level of gene transcription. such genetic regulation usually consists of interacting networks, whereby gene products from a single network can act to control their own expression or the production of protein in another network. engineered control of cellular function through the design and manipulation of such networks lies within the constraints of current technology. here we develop a model describing the regulation of gene expression, and elucidate the effects of noise on the formulation. we consider a single network derived from bacteriophage $\lambda$, and construct a two-parameter deterministic model describing the temporal evolution of the concentration of $\lambda$ repressor protein. bistability in the steady-state protein concentration arises naturally, and we show how the bistable regime is enhanced with the addition of the first operator site in the promotor region. we then show how additive and multiplicative external noise can be used to regulate expression. in the additive case, we demonstrate the utility of such control through the construction of a protein switch, whereby protein production is turned ``on'' and ``off'' using short noise pulses. in the multiplicative case, we show that small deviations in the transcription rate can lead to large fluctuations in the production of protein, and describe how these fluctuations can be used to amplify protein production significantly. these novel results suggest that an external noise source could be used as a switch and/or amplifier for gene expression. such a development could have important implications for gene therapy."
"an artificial chemistry implementation of a gene regulatory network. gene regulatory networks are networks of interactions in biological organisms responsible for determining the production levels of proteins and peptides. proteins are workers of a cell factory, and their production defines the goal of a cell and its development. various attempts have been made to model such networks both to understand these biological systems better and to use inspiration from understanding them to solve computational problems. in this work, a biologically more realistic model for gene regulatory networks is proposed, which incorporates cellular automata and artificial chemistry to model the interactions between regulatory proteins called the transcription factors and the regulatory sites of genes. the result of this work shows complex dynamics close to what can be observed in nature. here, an analysis of the impact of the initial states of the system on the produced dynamics is performed, showing that such evolvable models can be directed towards producing desired protein dynamics."
