"structure of symplectic lie groups and momentum map. we describe the structure of the lie groups endowed with a left-invariant symplectic form, called symplectic lie groups, in terms of semi-direct products of lie groups, symplectic reduction and principal bundles with affine fiber. this description is particularly nice if the group is hamiltonian, that is, if the left canonical action of the group on itself is hamiltonian. the principal tool used for our description is a canonical affine structure associated with the symplectic form. we also characterize the hamiltonian symplectic lie groups among the connected symplectic lie groups. we specialize our principal results to the cases of simply connected hamiltonian symplectic nilpotent lie groups or frobenius symplectic lie groups. finally we pursue the study of the classical affine lie group as a symplectic lie group. msc classes 53d20,70g65 key words:symplectic lie groups,hamiltonian lie groups, symplectic reduction,symplectic double extension."
"on manifolds with infinitely many fillable contact structures. we introduce the notion of asymptotically finitely generated contact structures, which states essentially that the symplectic homology in a certain degree of any filling of such contact manifolds is uniformly generated by only finitely many reeb orbits. this property is used to generalize a famous result by ustilovsky: we show that in a large class of manifolds (including all unit cotangent bundles and all weinstein fillable contact manifolds with torsion first chern class) each carries infinitely many exactly fillable contact structures. these are all different from the ones constructed recently by lazarev. along the way, the construction of symplectic homology is made more general. moreover, we give a detailed exposition of cieliebak's invariance theorem for subcritical handle attaching, where we provide explicit hamiltonians for the squeezing on the handle."
"contact homology of $s^1$-bundles over some symplectically reduced orbifolds. in this paper, we compute contact homology of some quasi-regular contact structures, which admit hamiltonian actions of reeb type of lie groups. we will discuss the toric contact case, (where the torus is of reeb type), and the case of homogeneous contact manifolds. in both of these cases the quotients by the reeb action are k\""ahler and admit perfect morse-bott functions via the moment map. it turns out that the contact homology depends only on the homology of the symplectic base and the bundle data of the contact manifolds as a circle bundle over the base. moreover we can identify the relevant holomorphic spheres in the bases which lift to gradient trajectories of the action functional on the loop space of the symplectization of m. in order to include all toric contact manifolds we extend a result of bourgeois to the case of circle bundles over symplectic orbifolds. in particular we are able to distinguish contact structures on many contact manifolds all in the same first chern class of $2n$-dimensional plane distributions."
