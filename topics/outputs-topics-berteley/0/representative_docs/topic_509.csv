"differential inequalities and univalent functions. let ${\mathcal m}$ be the class of analytic functions in the unit disk $\id$ with the normalization $f(0)=f'(0)-1=0$, and satisfying the condition $$\left |z^2\left (\frac{z}{f(z)}\right )''+ f'(z)\left(\frac{z}{f(z)} \right)^{2}-1\right |\leq 1, \quad z\in \id. $$ functions in $\mathcal{m}$ are known to be univalent in $\id$. in this paper, it is shown that the harmonic mean of two functions in ${\mathcal m}$ are closed, that is, it belongs again to ${\mathcal m}$. this result also holds for other related classes of normalized univalent functions. a number of new examples of functions in $\mathcal{m}$ are shown to be starlike in $\id$. however we conjecture that functions in $\mathcal{m}$ are not necessarily starlike, as apparently supported by other examples."
"bounds for the second hankel determinant of certain univalent functions. the estimates for the second hankel determinant a_2a_4-a_3^2 of analytic function f(z)=z+a_2 z^2+a_3 z^3+...b for which either zf'(z)/f(z) or 1+zf""(z)/f'(z) is subordinate to certain analytic function are investigated. the estimates for the hankel determinant for two other classes are also obtained. in particular, the estimates for the hankel determinant of strongly starlike, parabolic starlike, lemniscate starlike functions are obtained."
"hankel determinant of type $h_{2}(3)$ for inverse functions of some classes of univalent functions with missing second coefficient. in this paper we determine the upper bounds of $|h_{2}(3)|$ for the inverse functions of functions of some classes of univalent functions, where $h_{2}(3)(f)=a_{3}a_{5}-a_{4}^{2}$ is the hankel determinant of a special type."
