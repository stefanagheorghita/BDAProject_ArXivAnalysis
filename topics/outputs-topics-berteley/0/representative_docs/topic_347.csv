"on homotopy braids. homotopy braid group is the subject of the paper. first, linearity of homotopy braid group over the integers is proved. then we prove that the group homotopy braid group on three strands is torsion free."
"a stable classification of lefschetz fibrations. we study the classification of lefschetz fibrations up to stabilization by fiber sum operations. we show that for each genus there is a `universal' fibration f^0_g with the property that, if two lefschetz fibrations over s^2 have the same euler-poincare characteristic and signature, the same numbers of reducible singular fibers of each type, and admit sections with the same self-intersection, then after repeatedly fiber summing with f^0_g they become isomorphic. as a consequence, any two compact integral symplectic 4-manifolds with the same values of (c_1^2, c_2, c_1.[w], [w]^2) become symplectomorphic after blowups and symplectic sums with f^0_g."
"four-manifolds admitting hyperelliptic broken lefschetz fibrations. we introduce hyperelliptic simplified (more generally, directed) broken lefschetz fibrations, which is a generalization of hyperelliptic lefschetz fibrations. we construct involutions on the total spaces of such fibrations of genus $g\geq 3$ and extend these involutions to the four-manifolds obtained by blowing up the total spaces. the extended involutions induce double branched coverings over blown up sphere bundles over the sphere. we also show that the regular fiber of such a fibration of genus $g\geq 3$ represents a non-trivial rational homology class of the total space."
