"enhancing mortality prediction in cardiac arrest icu patients through meta-modeling of structured clinical data from mimic-iv. accurate early prediction of in-hospital mortality in intensive care units (icus) is essential for timely clinical intervention and efficient resource allocation. this study develops and evaluates machine learning models that integrate both structured clinical data and unstructured textual information, specifically discharge summaries and radiology reports, from the mimic-iv database. we used lasso and xgboost for feature selection, followed by a multivariate logistic regression trained on the top features identified by both models. incorporating textual features using tf-idf and bert embeddings significantly improved predictive performance. the final logistic regression model, which combined structured and textual input, achieved an auc of 0.918, compared to 0.753 when using structured data alone, a relative improvement 22%. the analysis of the decision curve demonstrated a superior standardized net benefit in a wide range of threshold probabilities (0.2-0.8), confirming the clinical utility of the model. these results underscore the added prognostic value of unstructured clinical notes and support their integration into interpretable feature-driven risk prediction models for icu patients."
"a machine learning framework for interpretable predictions in patient pathways: the case of predicting icu admission for patients with symptoms of sepsis. proactive analysis of patient pathways helps healthcare providers anticipate treatment-related risks, identify outcomes, and allocate resources. machine learning (ml) can leverage a patient's complete health history to make informed decisions about future events. however, previous work has mostly relied on so-called black-box models, which are unintelligible to humans, making it difficult for clinicians to apply such models. our work introduces patway-net, an ml framework designed for interpretable predictions of admission to the intensive care unit (icu) for patients with symptoms of sepsis. we propose a novel type of recurrent neural network and combine it with multi-layer perceptrons to process the patient pathways and produce predictive yet interpretable results. we demonstrate its utility through a comprehensive dashboard that visualizes patient health trajectories, predictive outcomes, and associated risks. our evaluation includes both predictive performance - where patway-net outperforms standard models such as decision trees, random forests, and gradient-boosted decision trees - and clinical utility, validated through structured interviews with clinicians. by providing improved predictive accuracy along with interpretable and actionable insights, patway-net serves as a valuable tool for healthcare decision support in the critical case of patients with symptoms of sepsis."
"hypergraph convolutional networks for fine-grained icu patient similarity analysis and risk prediction. the intensive care unit (icu) is one of the most important parts of a hospital, which admits critically ill patients and provides continuous monitoring and treatment. various patient outcome prediction methods have been attempted to assist healthcare professionals in clinical decision-making. existing methods focus on measuring the similarity between patients using deep neural networks to capture the hidden feature structures. however, the higher-order relationships are ignored, such as patient characteristics (e.g., diagnosis codes) and their causal effects on downstream clinical predictions. in this paper, we propose a novel hypergraph convolutional network that allows the representation of non-pairwise relationships among diagnosis codes in a hypergraph to capture the hidden feature structures so that fine-grained patient similarity can be calculated for personalized mortality risk prediction. evaluation using a publicly available eicu collaborative research database indicates that our method achieves superior performance over the state-of-the-art models on mortality risk prediction. moreover, the results of several case studies demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of the model decisions."
