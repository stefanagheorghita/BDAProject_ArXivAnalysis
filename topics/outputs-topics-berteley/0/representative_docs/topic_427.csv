"generalized torsion elements in infinite groups. a group element is called generalized torsion if a finite product of its conjugates is equal to the identity. we show that in a finitely generated abelian-by-finite group, an element is generalized torsion if and only if its image in the abelianization is torsion. we also prove a quantitative version with sharp bounds to the generalized exponent of these groups. in particular, we provide many examples of finitely presentable torsion-free groups in which all elements are generalized torsion. we also discuss positive generalized identities in abelian-by-finite groups and related classes."
"automorphisms of p-compact groups and their root data. we construct a model for the space of automorphisms of a connected p-compact group in terms of the space of automorphisms of its maximal torus normalizer and its root datum. as a consequence we show that any homomorphism to the outer automorphism group of a p-compact group can be lifted to a group action, analogous to a classical theorem of de siebenthal for compact lie groups. the model of this paper is used in a crucial way in our paper ``the classification of 2-compact groups'', where we prove the conjectured classification of 2-compact groups and determine their automorphism spaces."
"algebraic groups over free and hyperbolic groups. we define an algebraic group over a group $g$ to be a variety - that is, a subset of $g^d$ defined by equations over $g$ - endowed with a group law whose coordinates can be expressed as word maps. in the case where $g$ is a torsion-free hyperbolic group and the underlying variety is irreducible we give a complete description of all algebraic groups."
