"a stabilizer framework for contextual subspace vqe and the noncontextual projection ansatz. quantum chemistry is a promising application for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (nisq) devices. however, quantum computers have thus far not succeeded in providing solutions to problems of real scientific significance, with algorithmic advances being necessary to fully utilise even the modest nisq machines available today. we discuss a method of ground state energy estimation predicated on a partitioning the molecular hamiltonian into two parts: one that is noncontextual and can be solved classically, supplemented by a contextual component that yields quantum corrections obtained via a variational quantum eigensolver (vqe) routine. this approach has been termed contextual subspace vqe (cs-vqe), but there are obstacles to overcome before it can be deployed on nisq devices. the problem we address here is that of the ansatz - a parametrized quantum state over which we optimize during vqe. it is not initially clear how a splitting of the hamiltonian should be reflected in our cs-vqe ans\""atze. we propose a 'noncontextual projection' approach that is illuminated by a reformulation of cs-vqe in the stabilizer formalism. this defines an ansatz restriction from the full electronic structure problem to the contextual subspace and facilitates an implementation of cs-vqe that may be deployed on nisq devices. we validate the noncontextual projection ansatz using a quantum simulator, with results obtained herein for a suite of trial molecules."
"evaluating the impact of noise on the performance of the variational quantum eigensolver. quantum computers are expected to be highly beneficial for chemistry simulations, promising significant improvements in accuracy and speed. the most prominent algorithm for chemistry simulations on nisq devices is the variational quantum eigensolver (vqe). it is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm which calculates the ground state energy of a hamiltonian based on parametrized quantum circuits, while a classical optimizer is used to find optimal parameter values. however, quantum hardware is affected by noise, and it needs to be understood to which extent it can degrade the performance of the vqe algorithm. in this paper, we study the impact of noise on the example of the hydrogen molecule. first, we compare the vqe performance for a set of various optimizers, from which we find nft to be the most suitable one. next, we quantify the effect of different noise sources by systematically increasing their strength. the noise intensity is varied around values common to superconducting devices of ibm q, and curve fitting is used to model the relationship between the obtained energy values and the noise magnitude. since the amount of noise in a circuit highly depends on its architecture, we perform our studies for different ansatzes, including both hardware-efficient and chemistry-inspired ones."
"the variational quantum eigensolver: a review of methods and best practices. the variational quantum eigensolver (or vqe) uses the variational principle to compute the ground state energy of a hamiltonian, a problem that is central to quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics. conventional computing methods are constrained in their accuracy due to the computational limits. the vqe may be used to model complex wavefunctions in polynomial time, making it one of the most promising near-term applications for quantum computing. finding a path to navigate the relevant literature has rapidly become an overwhelming task, with many methods promising to improve different parts of the algorithm. despite strong theoretical underpinnings suggesting excellent scaling of individual vqe components, studies have pointed out that their various pre-factors could be too large to reach a quantum computing advantage over conventional methods. this review aims to provide an overview of the progress that has been made on the different parts of the algorithm. all the different components of the algorithm are reviewed in detail including representation of hamiltonians and wavefunctions on a quantum computer, the optimization process, the post-processing mitigation of errors, and best practices are suggested. we identify four main areas of future research:(1) optimal measurement schemes for reduction of circuit repetitions; (2) large scale parallelization across many quantum computers;(3) ways to overcome the potential appearance of vanishing gradients in the optimization process, and how the number of iterations required for the optimization scales with system size; (4) the extent to which vqe suffers for quantum noise, and whether this noise can be mitigated. the answers to these open research questions will determine the routes for the vqe to achieve quantum advantage as the quantum computing hardware scales up and as the noise levels are reduced."
