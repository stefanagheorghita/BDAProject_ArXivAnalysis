"error-correction performance of regular ring-linear ldpc codes over lee channels. most low-density parity-check (ldpc) code constructions are considered over finite fields. in this work, we focus on regular ldpc codes over integer residue rings and analyze their performance with respect to the lee metric. their error-correction performance is studied over two channel models, in the lee metric. the first channel model is a discrete memoryless channel, whereas in the second channel model an error vector is drawn uniformly at random from all vectors of a fixed lee weight. it is known that the two channel laws coincide in the asymptotic regime, meaning that their marginal distributions match. for both channel models, we derive upper bounds on the block error probability in terms of a random coding union bound as well as sphere packing bounds that make use of the marginal distribution of the considered channels. we estimate the decoding error probability of regular ldpc code ensembles over the channels using the marginal distribution and determining the expected lee weight distribution of a random ldpc code over a finite integer ring. by means of density evolution and finite-length simulations, we estimate the error-correction performance of selected ldpc code ensembles under belief propagation decoding and a low-complexity symbol message passing decoding algorithm and compare the performances. the analysis developed in this paper may serve to design regular ldpc codes over integer residue rings for storage and cryptographic application."
"design of ldpc code ensembles with fast convergence properties. the design of low-density parity-check (ldpc) code ensembles optimized for a finite number of decoder iterations is investigated. our approach employs exit chart analysis and differential evolution to design such ensembles for the binary erasure channel and additive white gaussian noise channel. the error rates of codes optimized for various numbers of decoder iterations are compared and it is seen that in the cases considered, the best performance for a given number of decoder iterations is achieved by codes which are optimized for this particular number. the design of generalized ldpc (gldpc) codes is also considered, showing that these structures can offer better performance than ldpc codes for low-iteration-number designs. finally, it is illustrated that ldpc codes which are optimized for a small number of iterations exhibit significant deviations in terms of degree distribution and weight enumerators with respect to ldpc codes returned by more conventional design tools."
"low-complexity ldpc codes with near-optimum performance over the bec. recent works showed how low-density parity-check (ldpc) erasure correcting codes, under maximum likelihood (ml) decoding, are capable of tightly approaching the performance of an ideal maximum-distance-separable code on the binary erasure channel. such result is achievable down to low error rates, even for small and moderate block sizes, while keeping the decoding complexity low, thanks to a class of decoding algorithms which exploits the sparseness of the parity-check matrix to reduce the complexity of gaussian elimination (ge). in this paper the main concepts underlying ml decoding of ldpc codes are recalled. a performance analysis among various ldpc code classes is then carried out, including a comparison with fixed-rate raptor codes. the results show that ldpc and raptor codes provide almost identical performance in terms of decoding failure probability vs. overhead."
