"promoting cooperation in the public goods game using artificial intelligent agents. the tragedy of the commons illustrates a fundamental social dilemma where individual rational actions lead to collectively undesired outcomes, threatening the sustainability of shared resources. strategies to escape this dilemma, however, are in short supply. in this study, we explore how artificial intelligence (ai) agents can be leveraged to enhance cooperation in public goods games, moving beyond traditional regulatory approaches to using ai as facilitators of cooperation. we investigate three scenarios: (1) mandatory cooperation policy for ai agents, where ai agents are institutionally mandated always to cooperate; (2) player-controlled agent cooperation policy, where players evolve control over ai agents' likelihood to cooperate; and (3) agents mimic players, where ai agents copy the behavior of players. using a computational evolutionary model with a population of agents playing public goods games, we find that only when ai agents mimic player behavior does the critical synergy threshold for cooperation decrease, effectively resolving the dilemma. this suggests that we can leverage ai to promote collective well-being in societal dilemmas by designing ai agents to mimic human players."
"evolution of cooperation among mobile agents. we study the effects of mobility on the evolution of cooperation among mobile players, which imitate collective motion of biological flocks and interact with neighbors within a prescribed radius $r$. adopting the prisoner's dilemma game and the snowdrift game as metaphors, we find that cooperation can be maintained and even enhanced for low velocities and small payoff parameters, when compared with the case that all agents do not move. but such enhancement of cooperation is largely determined by the value of $r$, and for modest values of $r$, there is an optimal value of velocity to induce the maximum cooperation level. besides, we find that intermediate values of $r$ or initial population densities are most favorable for cooperation, when the velocity is fixed. depending on the payoff parameters, the system can reach an absorbing state of cooperation when the snowdrift game is played. our findings may help understanding the relations between individual mobility and cooperative behavior in social systems."
"stability of pairwise social dilemma games: destructive agents, constructive agents, and their joint effects. destructive agents, who opt out of the game and indiscriminately harm others, paradoxically foster cooperation, representing an intriguing variant of the voluntary participation strategy. yet, their impact on cooperation remains inadequately understood, particularly in the context of pairwise social dilemma games and in comparison to their counterparts, constructive agents, who opt out of the game but indiscriminately benefit others. furthermore, little is known about the combined effects of both agent types on cooperation dynamics. using replicator dynamics in infinite and well-mixed populations, we find that, contrary to their role in facilitating cooperation in multiplayer games, destructive agents fail to encourage cooperation in pairwise social dilemmas. instead, they destabilize and may even replace defection in the prisoners' dilemma and stag-hunt games. similarly, in the chicken game, they can destabilize or replace the mixed equilibrium of cooperation and defection, and they undermine cooperation in the harmony game. conversely, constructive agents, when their payoffs exceed their contributions to opponents, can exhibit effects similar to destructive agents. however, if their payoffs are lower, while they destabilize defection in prisoners' dilemma and stag-hunt games, they do not disrupt the cooperation equilibrium in harmony games and have a negligible impact on the coexistence of cooperation in chicken games. the combination of destructive and constructive agents does not facilitate cooperation but instead generates complex evolutionary dynamics, including bi-stable, tri-stable, and quad-stable states, with outcomes contingent on their relative payoffs and game types. these results, taken together, enhance our understanding of the impact of the voluntary participation mechanism on cooperation, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of its influence."
