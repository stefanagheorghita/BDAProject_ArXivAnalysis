"stochastic maximum principle for a pdes with noise and control on the boundary. in this paper we prove necessary conditions for optimality of a stochastic control problem for a class of stochastic partial differential equations that is controlled through the boundary. this kind of problems can be interpreted as a stochastic control problem for an evolution system in an hilbert space. the regularity of the solution of the adjoint equation, that is a backward stochastic equation in infinite dimension, plays a crucial role in the formulation of the maximum principle."
"characterization of optimal feedback for stochastic linear quadratic control problems. one of the fundamental issues in control theory is to design feedback controls. it is well-known that, the purpose of introducing riccati equations in the deterministic case is to provide the desired feedback controls for linear quadratic control problems. to date, the same problem in the stochastic setting is only partially well-understood. in this paper, we establish the equivalence between the existence of optimal feedback controls for the stochastic linear quadratic control problems with random coefficients and the solvability of the corresponding backward stochastic riccati equations in a suitable sense. we also give a counterexample showing the nonexistence of feedback controls to a solvable stochastic linear quadratic control problem. this is a new phenomenon in the stochastic setting, significantly different from its deterministic counterpart."
"existence of an optimal control for stochastic systems with nonlinear cost functional. we consider a stochastic control problem which is composed of a controlled stochastic differential equation, and whose associated cost functional is defined through a controlled backward stochastic differential equation. under appropriate convexity assumptions on the coefficients of the forward and the backward equations we prove the existence of an optimal control on a suitable reference stochastic system. the proof is based on an approximation of the stochastic control problem by a sequence of control problems with smooth coefficients, admitting an optimal feedback control. the quadruplet formed by this optimal feedback control and the associated solution of the forward and the backward equations is shown to converge in law, at least along a subsequence. the convexity assumptions on the coefficients then allow to construct from this limit an admissible control process which, on an appropriate reference stochastic system, is optimal for our stochastic control problem."
