"anisotropic spin-blockade leakage current in a ge hole double quantum dot. group iv quantum dot hole spin systems, exhibiting strong spin-orbit coupling, provide platforms for various qubit architectures. the rapid advancement of solid-state technologies has significantly improved qubit quality, including the time scales characterizing electrical operation, relaxation, and dephasing. at this stage of development, understanding the relations between the underlying spin-orbit coupling and experimental parameters, such as quantum dot geometry and external electric and magnetic fields, has become a priority. here we focus on a ge hole double quantum dot in the pauli spin blockade regime and present a complete analysis of the leakage current under an out-of-plane magnetic field. by considering a model of anisotropic in-plane confinement and $k^3$-rashba spin-orbit coupling, we determine the behaviour of the leakage current as a function of detuning, magnetic field magnitude, interdot distance, and individual dot ellipticities. we identify regions in which the leakage current can be suppressed by quantum dot geometry designs. most importantly, by rotating one of the quantum dots, we observe that the quantum dot shape induces a strongly anisotropic leakage current. these findings provide guidelines for probing the spin-orbit coupling, enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio, and improving the precision of pauli spin blockade readout in hole qubit architectures."
"coulomb-induced dynamic correlations in a double nanosystem. time-dependent transport through two capacitively coupled quantum dots is studied in the framework of the generalized master equation. the coulomb interaction is included within the exact diagonalization method. each dot is connected to two leads at different times, such that a steady state is established in one dot before the coupling of the other dot to its leads. by appropriately tuning the bias windows on each dot we find that in the final steady state the transport may be suppressed or enhanced. these two cases are explained by the redistribution of charge on the many-body states built on both dots. we also predict and analyze the transient mutual charge sensing of the dots."
spin transitions in a small si quantum dot. we have studied the magnetic field dependence of the ground state energies in a small si quantum dot. at low fields the first five electrons are added in a spin-up -- spin-down sequence minimizing the total spin. this sequence does not hold for larger number of electrons in the dot. at high fields the dot undergoes transitions between states with different spins driven entirely by zeeman energy. we identify some features that can be attributed to transitions between different spin configurations preserving the total spin of the dot. for a few peaks we observed large linear shifts that correspond to the change of the spin of the dot by 3/2. such a change requires that an electron in the dot flips its spin during every tunneling event.
