"predicting sports scoring dynamics with restoration and anti-persistence. professional team sports provide an excellent domain for studying the dynamics of social competitions. these games are constructed with simple, well-defined rules and payoffs that admit a high-dimensional set of possible actions and nontrivial scoring dynamics. the resulting gameplay and efforts to predict its evolution are the object of great interest to both sports professionals and enthusiasts. in this paper, we consider two online prediction problems for team sports:~given a partially observed game who will score next? and ultimately who will win? we present novel interpretable generative models of within-game scoring that allow for dependence on lead size (restoration) and on the last team to score (anti-persistence). we then apply these models to comprehensive within-game scoring data for four sports leagues over a ten year period. by assessing these models' relative goodness-of-fit we shed new light on the underlying mechanisms driving the observed scoring dynamics of each sport. furthermore, in both predictive tasks, the performance of our models consistently outperforms baselines models, and our models make quantitative assessments of the latent team skill, over time."
"scoring dynamics across professional team sports: tempo, balance and predictability. despite growing interest in quantifying and modeling the scoring dynamics within professional sports games, relative little is known about what patterns or principles, if any, cut across different sports. using a comprehensive data set of scoring events in nearly a dozen consecutive seasons of college and professional (american) football, professional hockey, and professional basketball, we identify several common patterns in scoring dynamics. across these sports, scoring tempo---when scoring events occur---closely follows a common poisson process, with a sport-specific rate. similarly, scoring balance---how often a team wins an event---follows a common bernoulli process, with a parameter that effectively varies with the size of the lead. combining these processes within a generative model of gameplay, we find they both reproduce the observed dynamics in all four sports and accurately predict game outcomes. these results demonstrate common dynamical patterns underlying within-game scoring dynamics across professional team sports, and suggest specific mechanisms for driving them. we close with a brief discussion of the implications of our results for several popular hypotheses about sports dynamics."
"graph neural networks to predict sports outcomes. predicting outcomes in sports is important for teams, leagues, bettors, media, and fans. given the growing amount of player tracking data, sports analytics models are increasingly utilizing spatially-derived features built upon player tracking data. however, player-specific information, such as location, cannot readily be included as features themselves, since common modeling techniques rely on vector input. accordingly, spatially-derived features are commonly constructed in relation to anchor objects, such as the distance to a ball or goal, through global feature aggregations, or via role-assignment schemes, where players are designated a distinct role in the game. in doing so, we sacrifice inter-player and local relationships in favor of global ones. to address this issue, we introduce a sport-agnostic graph-based representation of game states. we then use our proposed graph representation as input to graph neural networks to predict sports outcomes. our approach preserves permutation invariance and allows for flexible player interaction weights. we demonstrate how our method provides statistically significant improvements over the state of the art for prediction tasks in both american football and esports, reducing test set loss by 9% and 20%, respectively. additionally, we show how our model can be used to answer ""what if"" questions in sports and to visualize relationships between players."
