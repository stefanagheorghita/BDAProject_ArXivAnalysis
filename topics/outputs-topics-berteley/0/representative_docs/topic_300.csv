"quantum hooks and mirror symmetry for flag varieties. given a flag variety $fl(n;r_1, \dots , r_\rho)$, there is natural ring morphism from the symmetric polynomial ring in $r_1$ variables to the quantum cohomology of the flag variety. in this paper, we show that for a large class of partitions $\lambda$, the image of $s_\lambda$ under the ring homomorphism is a schubert class which is described by partitioning $\lambda$ into a quantum hook (or $q$-hook) and a tuple of smaller partitions. we use this result to show that the pl\""ucker coordinate mirror of the flag variety describes quantum cohomology relations. this gives new insight into the structure of this superpotential, and the relation between superpotentials of flag varieties and those of grassmannians (where the superpotential was introduced by marsh--rietsch)."
"a geometric definition of schubert polynomials and dual schubert polynomials for classical lie groups. in this paper, we first discuss the topological properties of projective stiefel manifolds, we compute their cohomology rings and classify their cohomology endomorphisms; then by embedding the flag manifold of a classical lie group into its corresponding infinite dimensional projective stiefel manifold(which is homotopic to the product of infinite dimensional complex projective space $\mathbb{c}p^{\infty}$), we define the schubert polynomials and dual schubert polynomials. finally we discuss the property and the computation of these polynomials."
"quantum double schubert polynomials, quantum schubert polynomials and vafa-intriligator formula. we study the algebraic aspects of equivariant quantum cohomology algebra of the flag manifold. we introduce and study the quantum double schubert polynomials, which are the lascoux-schutzenberger type representatives of the equivariant quantum cohomology classes. our approach is based on the quantum cauchy identity. we define also quantum schubert polynomials as the gram-schmidt orthogonalization of some set of monomials with respect to the scalar product, defined by the grothendieck residue. using quantum cauchy identity, we prove that quantum schubert polynomials are the specialization of quantum double schubert polynomials with second set of variables equals to zero, and as a corollary obtain a simple formula for the quantum schubert polynomials. we also prove the higher genus analog of vafa-intriligator's formula for the flag manifolds and study the quantum residues generating function. we introduce the extended ehresman-bruhat order on the symmetric group and formulate the equivariant quantum pieri rule."
