"unravelling physics beyond the standard model with classical and quantum anomaly detection. much hope for finding new physics phenomena at microscopic scale relies on the observations obtained from high energy physics experiments, like the ones performed at the large hadron collider (lhc). however, current experiments do not indicate clear signs of new physics that could guide the development of additional beyond standard model (bsm) theories. identifying signatures of new physics out of the enormous amount of data produced at the lhc falls into the class of anomaly detection and constitutes one of the greatest computational challenges. in this article, we propose a novel strategy to perform anomaly detection in a supervised learning setting, based on the artificial creation of anomalies through a random process. for the resulting supervised learning problem, we successfully apply classical and quantum support vector classifiers (csvc and qsvc respectively) to identify the artificial anomalies among the sm events. even more promising, we find that employing an svc trained to identify the artificial anomalies, it is possible to identify realistic bsm events with high accuracy. in parallel, we also explore the potential of quantum algorithms for improving the classification accuracy and provide plausible conditions for the best exploitation of this novel computational paradigm."
"end-to-end particle and event identification at the large hadron collider with cms open data. from particle identification to the discovery of the higgs boson, deep learning algorithms have become an increasingly important tool for data analysis at the large hadron collider (lhc). we present an innovative end-to-end deep learning approach for jet identification at the compact muon solenoid (cms) experiment at the lhc. the method combines deep neural networks with low-level detector information, such as calorimeter energy deposits and tracking information, to build a discriminator to identify different particle species. using two physics examples as references: electron vs. photon discrimination and quark vs. gluon discrimination, we demonstrate the performance of the end-to-end approach on simulated events with full detector geometry as available in the cms open data. we also offer insights into the importance of the information extracted from various sub-detectors and describe how end-to-end techniques can be extended to event-level classification using information from the whole cms detector."
"calorimetry with deep learning: particle simulation and reconstruction for collider physics. using detailed simulations of calorimeter showers as training data, we investigate the use of deep learning algorithms for the simulation and reconstruction of particles produced in high-energy physics collisions. we train neural networks on shower data at the calorimeter-cell level, and show significant improvements for simulation and reconstruction when using these networks compared to methods which rely on currently-used state-of-the-art algorithms. we define two models: an end-to-end reconstruction network which performs simultaneous particle identification and energy regression of particles when given calorimeter shower data, and a generative network which can provide reasonable modeling of calorimeter showers for different particle types at specified angles and energies. we investigate the optimization of our models with hyperparameter scans. furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of the reconstruction model to shower inputs from other detector geometries, specifically atlas-like and cms-like geometries. these networks can serve as fast and computationally light methods for particle shower simulation and reconstruction for current and future experiments at particle colliders."
