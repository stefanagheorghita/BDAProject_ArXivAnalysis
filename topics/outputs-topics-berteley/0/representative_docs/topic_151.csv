"polymer release out of a spherical vesicle through a pore. translocation of a polymer out of curved surface or membrane is studied via mean first passage time approach. membrane curvature gives rise to a constraint on polymer conformation, which effectively drives the polymer to the outside of membrane where the available volume of polymer conformational fluctuation is larger. considering a polymer release out of spherical vesicle, polymer translocation time $\tau$ is changed to the scaling behavior $\tau\sim l^2$ for $r<r_g$, from $\tau\sim l^3$ for $r\gg r_g$, where $l$ is the polymer contour length and $r$, $r_g$ are vesicle radius and polymer radius of gyration respectively. also the polymer capture into a spherical budd is studied and possible apparatus for easy capture is suggested."
"pressure driven flow of polymer solutions in nanoscale slit pores. polymer solutions subject to pressure driven flow and in nanoscale slit pores are systematically investigated using the dissipative particle dynamics approach. we investigated the effect of molecular weight, polymer concentration and flow rate on the profiles across the channel of the fluid and polymer velocities, polymers density, and the three components of the polymers radius of gyration. we found that the mean streaming fluid velocity decreases as the polymer molecular weight or/and polymer concentration is increased, and that the deviation of the velocity profile from the parabolic profile is accentuated with increase in polymer molecular weight or concentration. we also found that the distribution of polymers conformation is highly anisotropic and non-uniform across the channel. the polymer density profile is also found to be non-uniform, exhibiting a local minimum in the center-plane followed by two symmetric peaks. we found a migration of the polymer chains either from or towards the walls. for relatively long chains, as compared to the thickness of the slit, a migration towards the walls is observed. however, for relatively short chains, a migration away from the walls is observed."
"conformational landscape of long semiflexible linear and ring polymers near attractive surfaces. conformations of a crowded neutral semiflexible polymer under confinement near an attractive wall are studied via coarse-grained simulations. we study the effects of the interplay of the length of the polymer, bending rigidity, and the repulsive crowder density on such equilibrium semiflexible polymer conformations. the length of the polymer dictates the number of distinct conformations of the adsorbed semiflexible polymer, suggesting that previous studies of short polymers are limited. the crowder density is shown to effectively reduce the bending rigidity of the polymers and at the highest crowder density considered, a crumpled wall-adsorbed polymer conformation is seen regardless of the semiflexibility. in addition, we study the role of the topology of the semiflexible polymer by comparing the results of linear semiflexible polymers with those of ring polymers. the conformational landscape of crowded ring polymers shows less diversity than that of a linear polymer and crowders are seen to affect the ring polymers differently than their linear counterparts."
