"unitary tetrahedron quantum gates. quantum simulations of many-body systems using 2-qubit yang-baxter gates offer a benchmark for quantum hardware. this can be extended to the higher dimensional case with $n$-qubit generalisations of yang-baxter gates called $n$-simplex operators. such multi-qubit gates potentially lead to shallower and more efficient quantum circuits as well. finding them amounts to identifying unitary solutions of the $n$-simplex equations, the building blocks of higher dimensional integrable systems. these are a set of highly non-linear and over determined system of equations making it notoriously hard to solve even when the local hilbert spaces are spanned by qubits. we systematically overcome this for higher simplex operators constructed using two methods: from clifford algebras and by lifting yang-baxter operators. the $n=3$ or the tetrahedron case is analyzed in detail. for the qubit case our methods produce 13 inequivalent families of unitary tetrahedron operators. 12 of these families are obtained by appending the 5 unitary families of 4 by 4 constant yang-baxter operators of dye-hietarinta, with a single qubit operator. as applications, universal sets of single, two and three qubit gates are realized using such unitary tetrahedron operators. the ideas presented in this work can be naturally extended to the higher simplex cases."
"matrix factorization for solutions of the yang-baxter equation. we study solutions of the yang-baxter equation on a tensor product of an arbitrary finite-dimensional and an arbitrary infinite-dimensional representations of the rank one symmetry algebra. we consider the cases of the lie algebra sl_2, the modular double (trigonometric deformation) and the sklyanin algebra (elliptic deformation). the solutions are matrices with operator entries. the matrix elements are differential operators in the case of sl_2, finite-difference operators with trigonometric coefficients in the case of the modular double or finite-difference operators with coefficients constructed out of jacobi theta functions in the case of the sklyanin algebra. we find a new factorized form of the rational, trigonometric, and elliptic solutions, which drastically simplifies them. we show that they are products of several simply organized matrices and obtain for them explicit formulae."
"majorana fermions solve the tetrahedron equations as well as higher simplex equations. yang-baxter equations define quantum integrable models. the tetrahedron and higher simplex equations are multi-dimensional generalizations. finding the solutions of these equations is a formidable task. in this work we develop a systematic method - constructing higher simplex operators [solutions of corresponding simplex equations] from lower simplex ones. we call it lifting. by starting from solutions of yang-baxter equations we can construct solutions of the tetrahedron equation and simplex equation in any dimension. we then generalize this by starting from a solution of any lower simplex equation and lifting it [construct solution] to another simplex equation in higher dimension. this process introduces several constraints among the different lower simplex operators that are lifted to form the higher simplex operators. we show that braided yang-baxter operators [solutions of yang-baxter equations independent of spectral parameters] constructed using majorana fermions satisfy these constraints, thus solving the higher simplex equations. as a consequence these solutions help us understand the action of an higher simplex operator on majorana fermions. apart from these we show that solutions constructed using dirac (complex) fermions and clifford algebras also satisfy these constraints. furthermore it is observed that the clifford solutions give rise to positive boltzmann weights resulting in the possibility of physical statistical mechanics models in higher dimensions. finally we also show that anti-yang-baxter operators [solutions of yang-baxter-like equations with a negative sign on the right hand side] can also be lifted to higher simplex solutions."
