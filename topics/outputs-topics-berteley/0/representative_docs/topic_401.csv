"the fully covariant energy momentum stress tensor for gravity and the einstein equation in general relativity. we give a fully covariant energy momentum stress tensor for the gravitational field which is easily physically motivated, and which leads to a very general derivation of the einstein equation for gravity. we do not need to assume any property of the surce matter fields' energy momentum stress tensor other than symmetry. we give a physical motivation for this choice using laser light pressure. as a consequence of our derivation, the energy momentum stress tensor for the total source matter and fields must be divergence free, when spacetime is 4 dimensional. moreoverr, if the total source matter fields are assumed to be divergence free, then either spacetime is dimension 4 or the spacetime has constant scalar curvature."
"extension of kodama vector and quasilocal quantities in three-dimensional axisymmetric spacetimes. spherically symmetric spacetimes admit the so-called kodama vector, which provides a locally conserved current and a preferred time even for dynamical spacetime without any time translation symmetry. a charge associated with this conserved current leads to a quasilocal mass which agrees with the misner-sharp mass. in three dimensions, spherically symmetric spacetimes correspond to axisymmetric ones, while axisymmetry allows spacetimes to be rotating with angular momentum. we extend the notion of the kodama vector to axisymmetric rotating spacetimes in three dimensions. we also define a quasilocal mass taking into account angular momentum in three-dimensional axisymmetric spacetimes."
"behavior of quasilocal mass under conformal transformations. we show that in a generic scalar-tensor theory of gravity, the ``referenced'' quasilocal mass of a spatially bounded region in a classical solution is invariant under conformal transformations of the spacetime metric. we first extend the brown-york quasilocal formalism to such theories to obtain the ``unreferenced'' quasilocal mass and prove it to be conformally invariant. the appropriate reference term in this case is defined by generalizing the hawking-horowitz prescription, which was originally proposed for general relativity. for such a choice of reference term, the referenced quasilocal mass for a general spacetime solution is obtained. this expression is shown to be a conformal invariant provided the conformal factor is a monotonic function of the scalar field. we apply this expression to the case of static spherically symmetric solutions with arbitrary asymptotics to obtain the referenced quasilocal mass of such solutions. finally, we demonstrate the conformal invariance of our quasilocal mass formula by applying it to specific cases of four-dimensional charged black hole spacetimes, of both the asymptotically flat and non-flat kinds, in conformally related theories."
