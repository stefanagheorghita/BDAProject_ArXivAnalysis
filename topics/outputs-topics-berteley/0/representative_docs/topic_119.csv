"a universal banach space with a $k$-unconditional basis. for a constant $k\geq 1$ let $\mathfrak{b}_k$ be the class of pairs $(x,(\mathbf e_n)_{n\in\omega})$ consisting of a banach space $x$ and an unconditional schauder basis $(\mathbf e_n)_{n\in\omega}$ for $x$, having the unconditional basic constant $k_u\leq k$. such pairs are called $k$-based banach spaces. a based banach space $x$ is rational if the unit ball of any finite-dimensional subspace spanned by finitely many basic vectors is a polyhedron whose vertices have rational coordinates in the schauder basis of $x$. using the technique of fra\""iss\'e theory, we construct a rational $k$-based banach space $\big(\mathbb u_k,(\mathbf e_n)_{n\in\omega}\big)$ which is $\mathfrak{ri}_k$-universal in the sense that each basis preserving isometry $f:\lambda\to\mathbb u_k$ defined on a based subspace $\lambda$ of a finite-dimensional rational $k$-based banach space $a$ extends to a basis preserving isometry $\bar f:a\to\mathbb u_k$ of the based banach space $a$. we also prove that the $k$-based banach space $\mathbb u_k$ is almost $\mathfrak{fi}_1$-universal in the sense that any base preserving $\varepsilon$-isometry $f:\lambda\to\mathbb u_k$ defined on a based subspace $\lambda$ of a finite-dimensional $1$-based banach space $a$ extends to a base preserving $\varepsilon$-isometry $\bar f:a\to\mathbb u_k$ of the based banach space $a$. on the other hand, we show that no almost $\mathfrak{fi}_k$-universal based banach space exists for $k>1$. the banach space $\mathbb u_k$ is isomorphic to the complementably universal banach space for the class of banach spaces with an unconditional schauder basis, constructed by pe\l czy\'nski in 1969."
"asymptotic infinite-dimensional theory of banach spaces. in this paper structure of infinite dimensional banach spaces is studied by using an asymptotic approach based on stabilization at infinity of finite dimensional subspaces which appear everywhere far away. this leads to notions of asymptotic structures and asymptotic versions of a given banach space. as an example of application of this approach, a class of asymptotic $l_p$-spaces is introduced and investigated in detail. some properties of this class, as duality and complementation, are analogous to properties of classical $l_p$ spaces, although the latter is more ``regular'' than its classical counterpart; in contrast, the property exhibited in the uniqueness theorem is very different than for spaces $l_p$."
"embedding into banach spaces with finite dimensional decompositions. this paper deals with the following types of problems: assume a banach space $x$ has some property (p). can it be embedded into some banach space $z$ with a finite dimensional decomposition having property (p), or more generally, having a property related to (p)? secondly, given a class of banach spaces, does there exist a banach space in this class, or in a closely related one, which is universal for this class?"
