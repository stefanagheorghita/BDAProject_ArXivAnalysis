"an {\it ab initio} relativistic coupled-cluster theory of dipole and quadrupole polarizabilities: applications to a few alkali atoms and alkaline earth ions. we present a general approach within the relativistic coupled-cluster theory framework to calculate exactly the first order wave functions due to any rank perturbation operators. using this method, we calculate the static dipole and quadrupole polarizabilities in some alkali atoms and alkaline earth-metal ions. this may be a good test of the present theory for different rank and parity interaction operators. this shows a wide range of applications including precise calculations of both parity and cp violating amplitudes due to rank zero and rank one weak interaction hamiltonians. we also give contributions from correlation effects and discuss them in terms of lower order many-body perturbation theory."
"hf trimer: 12d fully coupled quantum calculations of hf-stretch excited intramolecular and intermolecular vibrational states using contracted bases of intramolecular and intermolecular eigenstates. we present the computational methodology which for the first time allows rigorous twelve-dimensional (12d) quantum calculations of the coupled intramolecular and intermolecular vibrational states of hydrogen-bonded trimers of flexible diatomic molecules. its starting point is the approach that we introduced recently for fully coupled 9d quantum calculations of the intermolecular vibrational states of noncovalently bound trimers comprised of diatomics treated as rigid. in this paper it is extended to include the intramolecular stretching coordinates of the three diatomic monomers. the cornerstone of our 12d methodology is the partitioning of the full vibrational hamiltonian of the trimer into two reduced-dimension hamiltonians, one in 9d for the intermolecular degrees of freedom (dofs) and another in 3d for the intramolecular vibrations of the trimer, and a remainder term. these two hamiltonians are diagonalized separately and a fraction of their respective 9d and 3d eigenstates is included in the 12d product contracted basis for both the intra- and intermolecular dofs, in which the matrix of the full 12d vibrational hamiltonian of the trimer is diagonalized. this methodology is implemented in the 12d quantum calculations of the coupled intra- and intermolecular vibrational states of the hydrogen-bonded hf trimer on an {\it ab initio} calculated potential energy surface (pes). they reveal several interesting manifestations of significant coupling between the intra- and intermolecular vibrational modes of (hf)$_3$. the 12d calculations also show that the frequencies of the $v=1,2$ hf stretching states of hf trimer are strongly redshifted in comparison to those of the isolated hf monomer. the agreement between the 12d results and the limited spectroscopic data for hf trimer, while satisfactory, leaves room for improvement and points to the need for a more accurate pes."
"relativistic and electron correlation effects in static dipole polarizabilities for main-group elements. in this study, i compute the static dipole polarizability of main-group elements using the finite-field method combined with relativistic coupled-cluster and configuration interaction simulations. the computational results closely align with the values recommended in the 2018 table of static dipole polarizabilities of neutral elements [mol. phys. 117, 1200 (2019)]. additionally, i investigate the influence of relativistic effects and electron correlation on atomic dipole polarizabilities. specifically, three types of relativistic effects impacting dipole polarizabilities are studied: scalar-relativistic, spin-orbit coupling, and fully relativistic dirac-coulomb effects. the results indicate that scalar-relativistic effects are predominant for atoms in groups 1--2, with minimal influence from spin-orbit coupling effects. conversely, for elements in groups 13--18, scalar-relativistic effects are less significant, while spin-orbit coupling significantly affects elements starting from the fourth row in groups 13--14 and from the fifth row in groups 15--18. in each category of relativistic effects, the impact of electron correlation is evaluated. the results show that electron correlation significantly influences dipole polarizability calculations, particularly for groups 1--2 and 13--14 atoms, but is less significant for groups 15--18 atoms. this study provides a comprehensive and consistent dataset of dipole polarizabilities and contributes to a systematic understanding of the roles of relativistic and electron correlation effects in atomic dipole polarizabilities, serving as a valuable reference for future research."
