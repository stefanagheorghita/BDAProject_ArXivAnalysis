"the intermediate neutron capture process ii.nuclear uncertainties. carbon-enhanced metal-poor (cemp) r/s-stars show surface-abundance distributions characteristic of the so-called intermediate neutron capture process (i-process) of nucleosynthesis. we previously showed that the ingestion of protons in the convective helium-burning region of a low-mass low-metallicity star can explain the surface abundance distribution observed in cemp r/s stars relatively well. such an i-process requires detailed reaction network calculations involving hundreds of nuclei for which reaction rates have not yet been determined experimentally. we investigate the nuclear physics uncertainties affecting the i-process during the agb phase of low-metallicity low-mass stars by propagating the theoretical uncertainties in the radiative neutron capture cross sections, as well as the 13c(a,n)16o reaction rate, and estimating their impact on the surface-abundance distribution. it is found that considering systematic uncertainties on the various nuclear ingredients affecting the radiative neutron capture rates, surface elemental abundances are typically predicted within +/-0.4 dex. the 56 < z < 59 region of the spectroscopically relevant heavy-s elements of ba-la-ce-pr as well as the r-dominated eu element remain relatively unaffected by nuclear uncertainties. in contrast, the inclusion of the direct capture contribution impacts the rates in the neutron-rich a~45, 100, 160, and 200 regions, and the i-process production of the z~45 and 65-70 elements. uncertainties in the photon strength function also impact the overabundance factors by typically 0.2-0.4 dex. nuclear level densities tend to affect abundance predictions mainly in the z=74-79 regions. the uncertainties associated with the neutron-producing reaction 13c(a,n)16o and the unknown beta-decay rates are found to have a low impact on the overall surface enrichment"
"recommendations for monte carlo nucleosynthesis sampling (research note). context: recent reaction rate evaluations include reaction rate uncertainties that have been determined in a statistically meaningful manner. furthermore, reaction rate probability density distributions have been determined and published in the form of lognormal parameters with the specific goal of pursuing monte carlo nucleosynthesis studies. aims: to test and assess different methods of randomly sampling over reaction rate probability densities and to determine the most accurate method for estimating elemental abundance uncertainties. methods: experimental monte carlo reaction rates are first computed for the 22ne+alpha, 20ne(p,g)21na, 25mg(p,g)26al, and 18f(p,alpha)15o reactions, which are used to calculate reference nucleosynthesis yields for 16 nuclei affected by nucleosynthesis in massive stars and classical novae. five different methods of randomly sampling over these reaction rate probability distributions are then developed, tested, and compared with the reference nucleosynthesis yields. results: given that the reaction rate probability density distributions can be described accurately with a lognormal distribution, monte carlo nucleosynthesis variations arising from the parametrised estimates for the reaction rate variations agree remarkably well with those obtained from the true rate samples. most significantly, the most simple parametrisation agrees within just a few percent, meaning that monte carlo nucleosynthesis studies can be performed reliably using lognormal parametrisations of reaction rate probability density functions."
"experimental $^7$be production cross section from the $^7$li(p,n)$^7$be reaction at e$_p = 3.5-13$ mev. the $^7$li(p,n)$^7$be reaction is widely used as neutron source for neutron induced reaction cross section measurements, and for $^7$be radioactive source production. there are two prominent structures in the excitation function, a narrow resonance between $e_\mathrm{p}= 2.2-2.3$ mev, and a broad peak, around $e_\mathrm{p}= 5$ mev. there are tension between the experimental data sets both in the position and the width of this latter structure, as well as in the absolute scale of the data. in the present work the $^7$li(p,n)$^7$be reaction is investigated using the activation technique, with the aim of providing comprehensive cross section data covering the second structure and connecting prior literature data sets. the irradiations were performed with the atomki cyclotron accelerator with pairs of thin foil targets, thus with precisely controlled reaction energy in the range of e$_\mathrm{p} = 3.5-13$ mev. after the irradiations the activity of the samples was measured using a high-purity germanium detector. the energy uncertainty of the new data points is much smaller than in any of the previous works, while the cross section uncertainty is comparable with the most precise literature data. a consistent data set was obtained connecting the most recent and most precise literature data sets. with the new data the absolute magnitude of the $^7$li(p,n)$^7$be reaction cross section is constrained and became more precise."
