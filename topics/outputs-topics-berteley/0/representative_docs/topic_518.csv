"theory of water desalination with intercalation materials. we present porous electrode theory for capacitive deionization (cdi) with electrodes containing nanoparticles that consist of a redox-active intercalation material. a geometry of a desalination cell is considered which consists of two porous electrodes, two flow channels and an anion-exchange membrane, and we use nernst-planck theory to describe ion transport in the aqueous phase in all these layers. a single-salt solution is considered, with unequal diffusion coefficients for anions and cations. similar to previous models for cdi and electrodialysis, we solve the dynamic two-dimensional equations by assuming that flow of water, and thus the advection of ions, is zero in the electrode, and in the flow channel only occurs in the direction along the electrode and membrane. in all layers, diffusion and migration are only considered in the direction perpendicular to the flow of water. electronic as well as ionic transport limitations within the nanoparticles are neglected, and instead the frumkin isotherm (or regular solution model) is used to describe local chemical equilibrium of cations between the nanoparticles and the adjacent electrolyte, as a function of the electrode potential. our model describes the dynamics of key parameters of the cdi process with intercalation electrodes, such as effluent salt concentration, the distribution of intercalated ions, cell voltage, and energy consumption."
"role of charge regulation and flow slip on the ionic conductance of nanopores: an analytical approach. the number of precise conductance measurements in nanopores is quickly growing. in order to clarify the dominant mechanisms at play and facilitate the characterization of such systems for which there is still no clear consensus, we propose an analytical approach to the ionic conductance in nanopores that takes into account (i) electro-osmotic effects, (ii) flow slip at the pore surface for hydrophobic nanopores, (iii) a component of the surface charge density that is modulated by the reservoir $p$h and salt concentration $c_s$ using a simple charge regulation model, and (iv) a fixed surface charge density that is unaffected by $p$h and $c_s$. limiting cases are explored for various ranges of salt concentration and our formula is used to fit conductance experiments found in the literature for carbon nanotubes. this approach permits us to catalog the different possible transport regimes and propose an explanation for the wide variety of currently known experimental behavior for the conductance versus $c_s$."
"ion and water transport in charge-modified graphene nanopores. porous graphene has high mechanical strength and atomic layer thickness, which make it a promising material for material separation and biomolecule sensing. electrostatic interactions between charges in aqueous solution are a kind of strong long-range interaction which may have great influence on the fluid transport through nanopores. here, molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to investigate ion and water transport through a 1.05-nm-in-diameter monolayer graphene nanopore with its edge charge-modified. from the results, it is found that the nanopores are selective to counterions when they are charged. as the charge amount increases, the total ionic currents show an increase-decrease profile while the co-ion currents monotonously decrease. the co-ions rejection can reach 75% and 90% when the nanopores are negatively and positively charged, respectively. cl ions current increases and reaches a plateau, and na+ current decreases with the charge amount in the systems where they act as counterions. besides, the charge modification can enhance the water transport through nanopores obviously. this is mainly due to the ion selection of nanopores. especially, positive charges on the pore edge facilitate the water transport much more than negative charges."
