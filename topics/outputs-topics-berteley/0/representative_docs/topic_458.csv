"topological origin of non-hermitian skin effect in higher dimensions and uniform spectra. the non-hermitian skin effect is an iconic phenomenon characterized by the aggregation of eigenstates near the system boundaries in non-hermitian systems. while extensively studied in one dimension, understanding the skin effect and extending the non-bloch band theory to higher dimensions encounters a formidable challenge, primarily due to infinite lattice geometries or open boundary conditions. this work adopts a point-gap perspective and unveils that non-hermitian skin effect in all spatial dimensions originates from point gaps. we introduce the concept of uniform spectra and reveal that regardless of lattice geometry, their energy spectra are universally given by the uniform spectra, even though their manifestations of skin modes may differ. building on the uniform spectra, we demonstrate how to account for the skin effect with generic lattice cuts and establish the connections of skin modes across different geometric shapes via momentum-basis transformations. our findings highlight the pivotal roles point gaps play, offering a unified understanding of the topological origin of non-hermitian skin effect in all dimensions."
"real-space topological localizer index to fully characterize the dislocation skin effect. the dislocation skin effect exhibits the capacity of topological defects to trap an extensive number of modes in two-dimensional non-hermitian systems. similar to the corresponding skin effects caused by system boundaries, this phenomenon also originates from nontrivial topology. however, finding the relationship between the dislocation skin effect and nonzero topological invariants, especially in disordered systems, can be obscure and challenging. here, we introduce a real-space topological invariant based on the spectral localizer to characterize the skin effect on two-dimensional lattices. we demonstrate that this invariant consistently predicts the occurrence and location of both boundary and dislocation skin effects, offering a unified approach applicable to both ordered and disordered systems. our work demonstrates a general approach that can be utilized to diagnose the topological nature of various types of skin effects, particularly in the absence of translational symmetry when momentum-space descriptions are inapplicable."
"dynamical nonlinear higher-order non-hermitian skin effects and topological trap-skin phase. we study nonreciprocal nonlinear schr\""{o}dinger systems. as a prototype we analyze the hatano-nelson model together with a typical nonlinear term introduced and its generalization to two dimensions. we employ the quench dynamics, where a pulse is given to one site and its time evolution is analyzed. it is found that the skin state is always formed due to the nonreciprocal hopping and hence that the system is topological. however, the structure of the skin state is essentially modified by the nonlinear interaction because it favors a self-trapping. four typically different states emerge as an interplay between these two interactions, depending how the pulse is trapped to the initial site. they are the skin, trap-skin, shifted-trap-skin and embedded-trap-skin states, forming four phases in the one-dimensional model. the phase boundary is determined by a gap in terms of certain phase indicators. on the other hand, we find three phases with the shifted-trap-skin phase being absent in the two-dimensional model."
