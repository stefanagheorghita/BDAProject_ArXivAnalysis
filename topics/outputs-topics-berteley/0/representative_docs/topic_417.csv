"on the mean value property of fractional harmonic functions. as well known, harmonic functions satisfy the mean value property, namely the average of the function over a ball is equal to its value at the center. this fact naturally raises the question on whether this is a characterizing feature of balls, namely whether a set for which all harmonic functions satisfy the mean value property is necessarily a ball. this question was investigated by several authors, and was finally elegantly, completely and positively settled by \""ulk\""u kuran, with an artful use of elementary techniques. this classical problem has been recently fleshed out by giovanni cupini, nicola fusco, ermanno lanconelli and xiao zhong who proved a quantitative stability result for the mean value formula, showing that a suitable ""mean value gap"" (measuring the normalized difference between the average of harmonic functions on a given set and their pointwise value) is bounded from below by the lebesgue measure of the ""gap"" between the set and the ball (and, consequently, by the fraenkel asymmetry of the set). that is, if a domain ""almost"" satisfies the mean value property, then it must be necessarily close to a ball. here we investigate the nonlocal counterparts of these results. in particular we will prove a classification result and a stability result, establishing that: if fractional harmonic functions enjoy a suitable exterior average property for a given domain, then the domain is necessarily a ball, a suitable ""nonlocal mean value gap"" is bounded from below by an appropriate measure of the difference between the set and the ball. differently from the classical case, some of our arguments rely on purely nonlocal properties, with no classical counterpart, such as the fact that ""all functions are locally fractional harmonic up to a small error""."
"scattering matrices for close singular selfadjoint perturbations of unbounded selfadjoint operators. in this paper, we consider an unbounded selfadjoint operator $a$ and its selfadjoint perturbations in the same hilbert space $\mathcal{h}$. as s.albeverio and p. kurosov (2000), we call a selfadjoint operator $a_{1}$ the singular perturbation of $a$ if $a_{1}$ and {a} have different domains $\mathcal{d}(a),\mathcal{d}(a_{1})$ but $a=a_{1}$ on $\mathcal{d}(a)\cap\mathcal{d}(a_{1})$. assuming that $a$ has absolutely continuous spectrum and the difference of resolvents $r_{z}(a_{1}) -r_{z}(a)$ of $a_{1}$ and $a$ for non-real $z$ is a trace class operator we find the explicit expression for the scattering matrix for the pair $a, a_{1}$ through the constituent elements of the krein formula for the resolvents of this pair. as an illustration, we find the scattering matrix for the standardly defined laplace operator in $l_{2}\left(\mathbf{r}_{3}\right)$ and its singular perturbation in the form of an infinite sum of zero-range potentials."
"singular selfadjoint perturbations of unbounded selfadjoint operators. reverse approach. let $a$ and $a_{1}$ are unbounded selfadjoint operators in a hilbert space $\mathcal{h}$. following \cite{ak} we call $a_{1}$ a \textit{singular} perturbation of $a$ if $a$ and $a_{1}$ have different domains $\mathcal{d}(a),\mathcal{d}(a_{1})$ but $\mathcal{d}(a)\cap\mathcal{d}(a_{1})$ is dense in $\mathcal{h}$ and $a=a_{1}$ on $\mathcal{d}(a)\cap\mathcal{d}(a_{1})$. in this note we specify without recourse to the theory of selfadjoint extensions of symmetric operators the conditions under which a given bounded holomorphic operator function in the open upper and lower half-planes is the resolvent of a singular perturbation $a_{1}$ of a given selfadjoint operator $a$. for the special case when $a$ is the standardly defined selfadjoint laplace operator in $\mathbf{l}_{2}(\mathbf{r}_{3})$ we describe using the m.g. krein resolvent formula a class of singular perturbations $a_{1}$, which are defined by special selfadjoint boundary conditions on a finite or spaced apart by bounded from below distances infinite set of points in $\mathbf{r}_{3}$ and also on a bounded segment of straight line embedded into $\mathbf{r}_{3}$ by connecting parameters in the boundary conditions for $a_{1}$ and the independent on $a$ matrix or operator parameter in the krein formula for the pair $a, a_{1}$."
