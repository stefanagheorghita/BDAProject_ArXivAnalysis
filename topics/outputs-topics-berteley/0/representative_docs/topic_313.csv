"young people's burden: requirement of negative co2 emissions. global temperature is a fundamental climate metric highly correlated with sea level, which implies that keeping shorelines near their present location requires keeping global temperature within or close to its preindustrial holocene range. however, global temperature excluding short-term variability now exceeds +1degc relative to the 1880-1920 mean and annual 2016 global temperature was almost +1.3degc. we show that global temperature has risen well out of the holocene range and earth is now as warm as during the prior interglacial, when sea level reached 6-9 meters higher than today. further, earth is out of energy balance with present atmospheric composition, implying more warming is in the pipeline, and we show that the growth rate of greenhouse gas climate forcing has accelerated markedly in the past decade. the rapidity of ice sheet and sea level response to global temperature is difficult to predict but is dependent on the magnitude of warming. targets for limiting global warming should aim to avoid leaving global temperature at eemian or higher levels for centuries. such targets require ""negative emissions"", extraction of co2 from the air. if phasedown of fossil fuel emissions begins soon, improved agricultural and forestry practices may provide much of the extraction, and the magnitude and duration of global temperature excursion above the natural range of the current interglacial could be limited and irreversible impacts minimized. in contrast, continued high emissions place a burden on young people to undertake massive technological co2 extraction to limit climate change and its consequences. proposed methods of extraction have minimal estimated costs of 89-535 trillion dollars this century and have large risks and uncertain feasibility. continued high emissions unarguably sentences young people to a massive, implausible cleanup, growing deleterious climate impacts or both."
"predicting climate change using response theory: global averages and spatial patterns. the provision of accurate methods for predicting the climate response to anthropogenic and natural forcings is a key contemporary scientific challenge. using a simplified and efficient open-source general circulation model of the atmosphere featuring o($10^5$) degrees of freedom, we show how it is possible to approach such a problem using nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. response theory allows one to practically compute the time-dependent measure supported on the pullback attractor of the climate system, whose dynamics is non-autonomous as a result of time-dependent forcings. we propose a simple yet efficient method for predicting - at any lead time and in an ensemble sense - the change in climate properties resulting from increase in the concentration of co$_2$ using test perturbation model runs. we assess strengths and limitations of the response theory in predicting the changes in the globally averaged values of surface temperature and of the yearly total precipitation, as well as in their spatial patterns. the quality of the predictions obtained for the surface temperature fields is rather good, while in the case of precipitation a good skill is observed only for the global average. we also show how it is possible to define accurately concepts like the the inertia of the climate system or to predict when climate change is detectable given a scenario of forcing. our analysis can be extended for dealing with more complex portfolios of forcings and can be adapted to treat, in principle, any climate observable. our conclusion is that climate change is indeed a problem that can be effectively seen through a statistical mechanical lens, and that there is great potential for optimizing the current coordinated modelling exercises run for the preparation of the subsequent reports of the intergovernmental panel for climate change."
"emergent constraints on climate sensitivities. despite major advances in climate science over the last 30 years, persistent uncertainties in projections of future climate change remain. climate projections are produced with increasingly complex models which attempt to represent key processes in the earth system, including atmospheric and oceanic circulations, convection, clouds, snow, sea-ice, vegetation and interactions with the carbon cycle. uncertainties in the representation of these processes feed through into a range of projections from the many state-of-the-art climate models now being developed and used worldwide. for example, despite major improvements in climate models, the range of equilibrium global warming due to doubling carbon dioxide still spans a range of more than three. here we review a promising way to make use of the ensemble of climate models to reduce the uncertainties in the sensitivities of the real climate system. the emergent constraint approach uses the model ensemble to identify a relationship between an uncertain aspect of the future climate and an observable variation or trend in the contemporary climate. this review summarises previous published work on emergent constraints, and discusses the huge promise and potential dangers of the approach. most importantly, it argues that emergent constraints should be based on well-founded physical principles such as the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. it is hoped that this review will stimulate physicists to contribute to the rapidly developing field of emergent constraints on climate projections, bringing to it much needed rigour and physical insights."
