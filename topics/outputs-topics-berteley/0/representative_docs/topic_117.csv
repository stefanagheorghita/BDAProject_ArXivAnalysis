"on the critical coupling of the finite kuramoto model on dense networks. kuramoto model is one of the most prominent models for the synchronization of coupled oscillators. it has long been a research hotspot to understand how natural frequencies, the interaction between oscillators, and network topology determine the onset of synchronization. in this paper, we investigate the critical coupling of kuramoto oscillators on deterministic dense networks, viewed as a natural generalization from all-to-all networks of identical oscillators. we provide a sufficient condition under which the kuramoto model with non-identical oscillators has one unique and stable equilibrium. moreover, this equilibrium is phase cohesive and enjoys local exponential synchronization. we perform numerical simulations of the kuramoto model on random networks and circulant networks to complement our theoretical analysis and provide insights for future research."
"macroscopic quantum synchronization effects. we theoretically describe macroscopic quantum synchronization effects occurring in a network of all-to-all coupled quantum limit-cycle oscillators. the coupling causes a transition to synchronization as indicated by the presence of global phase coherence. we demonstrate that the microscopic quantum properties of the oscillators qualitatively shape the synchronization behavior in a macroscopically large network. specifically, they result in a blockade of collective synchronization that is not expected for classical oscillators. additionally, the macroscopic ensemble shows emergent behavior not present at the level of two coupled quantum oscillators."
"kuramoto oscillators in random networks. by means of numerical analysis conducted with the aid of the computer, the collective synchronization of coupled phase oscillators in the kuramoto model in the connected regime of random networks of various sizes is studied. the oscillators synchronize and achieve phase coherence, and this process is not significantly affected by the level of connectivity of the network. if the probability that two oscillators are coupled is around the network connectivity threshold synchronization still occurs, although in a more attenuated way. if the size of the network is sufficiently large the oscillators have a phase transition."
