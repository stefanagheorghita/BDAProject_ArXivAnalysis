"geometry of epithelial cells provides a robust method for image based inference of stress within tissues. cellular mechanics plays an important role in epithelial morphogenesis, a process wherein cells reshape and rearrange to produce tissue-scale deformations. however, the study of tissue-scale mechanics is impaired by the difficulty of direct measurement of stress in-vivo. alternative, image-based inference schemes aim to estimate stress from snapshots of cellular geometry but are challenged by sensitivity to fluctuations and measurement noise as well as the dependence on boundary conditions. here we overcome these difficulties by introducing a new variational approach - the geometrical variation method (gvm) - which exploits the fundamental duality between stress and cellular geometry that exists in the state of mechanical equilibrium of discrete mechanical networks that approximate cellular tissues. in the geometrical variation method, the two dimensional apical geometry of an epithelial tissue is approximated by a 2d tiling with circular arc polygons (cap) in which the arcs represent intercellular interfaces defined by the balance of local line tension and pressure differentials between adjacent cells. we take advantage of local constraints that mechanical equilibrium imposes on cap geometry to define a variational procedure that extracts the best fitting equilibrium configuration from images of epithelial monolayers. the gvm-based stress inference algorithm has been validated by the comparison of the predicted cellular and mesoscopic scale stress and measured myosin ii patterns in the epithelial tissue during drosophila embryogenesis. gvm prediction of mesoscopic stress tensor correlates at the 80% level with the measured myosin distribution and reveals that most of the myosin ii activity is involved in a static internal force balance within the epithelial layer. lastly, this study provides a practical method for non-destructive estimation of stress in live epithelial tissues."
"relating cell shape and mechanical stress in a spatially disordered epithelium using a vertex-based model. using a popular vertex-based model to describe a spatially disordered planar epithelial monolayer, we examine the relationship between cell shape and mechanical stress at the cell and tissue level. deriving expressions for stress tensors starting from an energetic formulation of the model, we show that the principal axes of stress for an individual cell align with the principal axes of shape, and we determine the bulk effective tissue pressure when the monolayer is isotropic at the tissue level. using simulations for a monolayer that is not under peripheral stress, we fit parameters of the model to experimental data for xenopus embryonic tissue. the model predicts that mechanical interactions can generate mesoscopic patterns within the monolayer that exhibit long-range correlations in cell shape. the model also suggests that the orientation of mechanical and geometric cues for processes such as cell division are likely to be strongly correlated in real epithelia. some limitations of the model in capturing geometric features of xenopus epithelial cells are highlighted."
"jamming and force distribution in growing epithelial tissue. we investigate morphologies of proliferating cellular tissues using a newly developed numerical simulation model for mechanical cell division and migration in 2d. the model is applied to a bimodal mixture consisting of stiff cells with a low growth potential and soft cells with a high growth potential; cancer cells are typically considered to be softer than healthy cells. in an even mixture, the soft cells develop into a tissue matrix and the stiff cells into a dendrite-like network structure. when soft cells are placed inside a tissue consisting of stiff cells (to model cancer growth), the soft cells develop to a fast growing tumor-like structure that gradually evacuates the stiff cell matrix. the model also demonstrates 1) how soft cells orient themselves in the direction of the largest effective stiffness as predicted by the theory of bischofs and schwarz (proc. natl. acad. sci u.s.a., 100, 9274--9279 (2003) and 2) that the orientation and force generation continue a few cell rows behind the soft-stiff interface. with increasing inter-cell friction, tumor growth slows down and cell death occurs. the contact force distribution between cells is demonstrated to be highly sensitive to cell type mixtures and cell-cell interactions, which indicates that local mechanical forces can be useful as a regulator of tissue formation. the results shed new light on established experimental data."
