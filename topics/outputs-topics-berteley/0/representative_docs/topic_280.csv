"micelle formation of diblock copolymers driven by cononsolvency effect. this study utilizes self-consistent field theory to characterize various features of cononsolvency-driven spherical micelles formed by double hydrophilic block copolymers (dhbcs). micelles are observed only at an intermediate cosolvent fraction, forming abruptly at a specific solvent/cosolvent mixing ratio and gradually disappearing with further cosolvent addition. a stronger core-block - cosolvent attractive interaction leads to a lower critical micelle concentration and a higher aggregation number. the density profile of cononsolvency-driven micelles is compared with that of conventional micelles, which form due to core-block - solvent repulsive interactions. in conventional micelles, the core is primarily occupied by polymer segments, whereas in cononsolvency-driven micelles, the core consists mainly of solvents and cosolvents. this fundamental difference can be explained through thermodynamic analysis. conventional micelle formation is driven by the reduction of core-block - solvent contact due to repulsive interactions. in contrast, cononsolvency-driven micelle formation is governed by an increase in core-block - cosolvent contact area, playing the major role to minimize the total free energy-an essential distinction from conventional micelles."
"crystallization in melts and poor-solvent solutions of semiflexible polymers: extensive dpd study. in the present work, crystallization in melts and poor-solvent solutions of semiflexible polymers with different concentration was studied by means of dissipative particle dynamics simulation technique. we use a coarse-grained polymer model trying to catch general principles of crystallization in such systems on large time and length scales. we observe the crystallization process starting from an initial randomly prepared system with different polymer volume fractions in a poor solvent. because the solvent is very poor, the macrophase polymer-solvent separation takes place very fast and is accompanied by partial polymer crystallization. we have found that the overall crystalline fraction at the end of crystallization process decreases upon increasing the polymer volume fraction in the initial randomly prepared system, while the steady-state crystallization speed is almost the same at polymer volume fractions larger than 50\%. at the same time, the average crystallite size differs considerably and has a maximum value in the systems with 90\% polymer volume fraction. we assume that this polymer concentration is an optimal value in a sense of a balance between the amount of polymer material available for increasing crystallite size and chain entanglements preventing crystallites growth and merging."
"structure of colloid-polymer suspensions. we discuss structural correlations in mixtures of free polymer and colloidal particles based on a microscopic, 2-component liquid state integral equation theory. whereas in the case of polymers much smaller than the spherical particles the relevant polymer degree of freedom is the center of mass, for polymers larger than the (nano-) particles conformational rearrangements need to be considered. they have the important consequence that the polymer depletion layer exhibits two widely different length scales, one of the order of the particle radius, the other of the order of the polymer radius or the polymer density screening length in dilute or semidilute concentrations, respectively. their consequences on phase stability and structural correlations are discussed extensively."
