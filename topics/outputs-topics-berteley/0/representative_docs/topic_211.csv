"organisation of signal flow in directed networks. confining an answer to the question whether and how the coherent operation of network elements is determined by the the network structure is the topic of our work. we map the structure of signal flow in directed networks by analysing the degree of edge convergence and the overlap between the in- and output sets of an edge. definitions of convergence degree and overlap are based on the shortest paths, thus they encapsulate global network properties. using the defining notions of convergence degree and overlapping set we clarify the meaning of network causality and demonstrate the crucial role of chordless circles. in real-world networks the flow representation distinguishes nodes according to their signal transmitting, processing and control properties. the analysis of real-world networks in terms of flow representation was in accordance with the known functional properties of the network nodes. it is shown that nodes with different signal processing, transmitting and control properties are randomly connected at the global scale, while local connectivity patterns depart from randomness. grouping network nodes according to their signal flow properties was unrelated to the network's community structure. we present evidence that signal flow properties of small-world-like, real-world networks can not be reconstructed by algorithms used to generate small-world networks. convergence degree values were calculated for regular oriented trees, and its probability density function for networks grown with the preferential attachment mechanism. for erd\h{o}s-r\'enyi graphs we calculated both the probability density function of convergence degrees and of overlaps."
"a directed, bi-populated preferential attachment model with applications to analyzing the glass ceiling effect. preferential attachment, homophily and, their consequences such as the glass ceiling effect have been well-studied in the context of undirected networks. however, the lack of an intuitive, theoretically tractable model of a directed, bi-populated~(i.e.,~containing two groups) network with variable levels of preferential attachment, homophily and growth dynamics~(e.g.,~the rate at which new nodes join, whether the new nodes mostly follow existing nodes or the existing nodes follow them, etc.) has largely prevented such consequences from being explored in the context of directed networks, where they more naturally occur due to the asymmetry of links. to this end, we present a rigorous theoretical analysis of the \emph{directed mixed preferential attachment} model and, use it to analyze the glass ceiling effect in directed networks. more specifically, we derive the closed-form expressions for the power-law exponents of the in- and out- degree distributions of each group~(minority and majority) and, compare them with each other to obtain insights. in particular, our results yield answers to questions such as: \emph{when does the minority group have a heavier out-degree (or in-degree) distribution compared to the majority group? what effect does frequent addition of edges between existing nodes have on the in- and out- degree distributions of the majority and minority groups?}. such insights shed light on the interplay between the structure~(i.e., the in- and out- degree distributions of the two groups) and dynamics~(characterized collectively by the homophily, preferential attachment, group sizes and growth dynamics) of various real-world networks. finally, we utilize the obtained analytical results to characterize the conditions under which the glass ceiling effect emerge in a directed network. our analytical results are supported by detailed numerical results."
"an extended formalism for preferential attachment in heterogeneous complex networks. in this paper we present a framework for the extension of the preferential attachment (pa) model to heterogeneous complex networks. we define a class of heterogeneous pa models, where node properties are described by fixed states in an arbitrary metric space, and introduce an affinity function that biases the attachment probabilities of links. we perform an analytical study of the stationary degree distributions in heterogeneous pa networks. we show that their degree densities exhibit a richer scaling behavior than their homogeneous counterparts, and that the power law scaling in the degree distribution is robust in presence of heterogeneity."
