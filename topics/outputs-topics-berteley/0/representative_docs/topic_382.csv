"distributed space-time interference alignment with moderately-delayed csit. this paper proposes an interference alignment method with distributed and delayed channel state information at the transmitter (csit) for a class of interference networks. the core idea of the proposed method is to align interference signals over time at the unintended receivers in a distributed manner. with the proposed method, achievable trade-offs between the sum of degrees of freedom (sum-dof) and feedback delay of csi are characterized in both the x-channel and three-user interference channel to reveal the impact on how the csi feedback delay affects the sum-dof of the interference networks. a major implication of derived results is that distributed and moderately- delayed csit is useful to strictly improve the sum-dof over the case of no csi at the transmitter in a certain class of interference networks. for a class of x-channels, the results show how to optimally use distributed and moderately-delayed csit to yield the same sum-dof as instantaneous and global csit. further, leveraging the proposed transmission method and the known outer bound results, the sum-capacity of the two-user x-channel with a particular set of channel coefficients is characterized within a constant number of bits."
"achievable dof regions of mimo networks with imperfect csit. we focus on a two-receiver multiple-input-multiple-output (mimo) broadcast channel (bc) and interference channel (ic) with an arbitrary number of antennas at each node. we assume an imperfect knowledge of local channel state information at the transmitters (csit), whose error decays with the signal-to-noise-ratio. with such configuration, we characterize the achievable degrees-of-freedom (dof) regions in both bc and ic, by proposing a rate-splitting approach, which divides each receiver's message into a common part and a private part. compared to the rs scheme designed for the symmetric mimo case, this scheme is suitable for the general asymmetric deployment with an arbitrary number of antennas at each node. in bc, the proposed block 1) employs an unequal power allocation to the private messages of the two receivers, 2) exploits the benefit of having an extra spatial dimension at one receiver, and 3) is carried out with a space-time transmission. these features enable the scheme to yield a greater dof region than trivially extending the scheme designed for the symmetric case. in ic, we modify the scheme proposed for the bc case by applying a linear transformation to the channel matrices. such a linear transformation allows us to identify the signal space where the two transmitted signals interfere with each other and propose a proper power allocation policy. the achievable dof regions are shown to be optimal for some antenna configurations."
"aligned interference neutralization and the degrees of freedom of the 2 user interference channel with instantaneous relay. it is well known that the classical 2 user gaussian interference channel has only 1 degree of freedom (dof), which can be achieved by orthogonal time division among the 2 users. it is also known that the use of conventional relays, which introduce a processing delay of at least one symbol duration relative to the direct paths between sources and destinations, does not increase the dof of the 2 user interference channel. the use of instantaneous relays (relays-without-delay) has been explored for the single user point-to-point setting and it is known that such a relay, even with memoryless forwarding at the relay, can achieve a higher capacity than conventional relays. in this work, we show that the 2 user interference channel with an instantaneous relay, achieves 3/2 dof. thus, an instantaneous relay increases not only the capacity but also the dof of the 2 user interference channel. the achievable scheme is inspired by the aligned interference neutralization scheme recently proposed for the 2x2x2 interference channel. remarkably the dof gain is achieved with memoryless relays, i.e., with relays that have no memory of past received symbols."
