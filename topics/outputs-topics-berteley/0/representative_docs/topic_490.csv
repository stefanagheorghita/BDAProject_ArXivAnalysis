tropical eigenwave and intermediate jacobians. tropical manifolds are polyhedral complexes enhanced with certain kind of affine structure. this structure manifests itself through a particular cohomology class which we call the eigenwave of a tropical manifold. other wave classes of similar type are responsible for deformations of the tropical structure. if a tropical manifold is approximable by a 1-parametric family of complex manifolds then the eigenwave records the monodromy of the family around the tropical limit. with the help of tropical homology and the eigenwave we define tropical intermediate jacobians which can be viewed as tropical analogs of classical intermediate jacobians.
"geometry of tropical extensions of hyperfields. we study the geometry of tropical extensions of hyperfields, including the ordinary, signed and complex tropical hyperfields. we introduce the framework of 'enriched valuations' as hyperfield homomorphisms to tropical extensions, and show that a notable family of them are relatively algebraically closed. our main results are hyperfield analogues of kapranov's theorem and the fundamental theorem of tropical geometry. utilising these theorems, we introduce fine tropical varieties and prove a structure theorem for them in terms of their initial ideals."
"tropical count of curves on abelian varieties. we investigate the problem of counting tropical genus g curves in g-dimensional tropical abelian varieties. for g = 2, 3, we prove that the tropical count matches the count provided by g\""ottsche, bryan-leung, and lange-sernesi in the complex setting."
