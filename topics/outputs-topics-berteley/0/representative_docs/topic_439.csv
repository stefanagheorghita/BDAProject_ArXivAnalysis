"exploring query understanding for amazon product search. online shopping platforms, such as amazon, offer services to billions of people worldwide. unlike web search or other search engines, product search engines have their unique characteristics, primarily featuring short queries which are mostly a combination of product attributes and structured product search space. the uniqueness of product search underscores the crucial importance of the query understanding component. however, there are limited studies focusing on exploring this impact within real-world product search engines. in this work, we aim to bridge this gap by conducting a comprehensive study and sharing our year-long journey investigating how the query understanding service impacts amazon product search. firstly, we explore how query understanding-based ranking features influence the ranking process. next, we delve into how the query understanding system contributes to understanding the performance of a ranking model. building on the insights gained from our study on the evaluation of the query understanding-based ranking model, we propose a query understanding-based multi-task learning framework for ranking. we present our studies and investigations using the real-world system on amazon search."
"evaluating chatbots to promote users' trust -- practices and open problems. chatbots, the common moniker for collaborative assistants, are artificial intelligence (ai) software that enables people to naturally interact with them to get tasks done. although chatbots have been studied since the dawn of ai, they have particularly caught the imagination of the public and businesses since the launch of easy-to-use and general-purpose large language model-based chatbots like chatgpt. as businesses look towards chatbots as a potential technology to engage users, who may be end customers, suppliers, or even their own employees, proper testing of chatbots is important to address and mitigate issues of trust related to service or product performance, user satisfaction and long-term unintended consequences for society. this paper reviews current practices for chatbot testing, identifies gaps as open problems in pursuit of user trust, and outlines a path forward."
"how to align large language models for teaching english? designing and developing llm based-chatbot for teaching english conversation in efl, findings and limitations. this study investigates the design, development, and evaluation of a large language model (llm)-based chatbot for teaching english conversations in an english as a foreign language (efl) context. employing the design and development research (ddr), we analyzed needs, established design principles, and iteratively refined a chatbot through experimenting various llms and alignment methods. through both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we identified the most effective llm and its prompt combination to generate high-quality, contextually appropriate responses. interviews with teachers provided insights into desirable system features, potential educational applications, and ethical considerations in the development and deployment of the chatbots. the design iterations yielded the importance of feedback mechanisms and customizable ai personas. future research should explore adaptive feedback strategies, collaborative approaches with various stakeholders, and the integration of insights from human-computer interaction (hci) and user experience (ux) design. this study contributes to the growing body of research on applying llms in language education, providing insights and recommendations for the design, development, and evaluation of llm-based chatbots for efl conversation practice. as the field evolves, ongoing research and collaboration among educators, ai engineers, and other stakeholders will be essential to harness the potential of these technologies to enhance language learning experiences."
