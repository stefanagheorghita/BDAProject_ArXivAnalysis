"full jet tomography of high-energy nuclear collisions. parton energy loss in the hot qcd medium will manifest itself not only in leading hadron spectra but also in reconstructed jet productions in high-energy nucleus-nucleus collisions. in this paper we report on recent theoretical efforts in studying full jet observables in relativistic heavy-ion collisions by discussing the modifications of jet shapes, inclusive jet cross section and the vector boson accompanied jet production in the presence of the qgp-induced jet quenching."
"nuclear modification of full jets and jet structure in relativistic nuclear collisions. with our coupled jet-fluid model, we study the nuclear modifications of full jets and jet structures for single inclusive jet and $\gamma$-jet events in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. the evolution of full jet showers is studied via a set of coupled transport equations including the effects of collisional energy loss, transverse momentum broadening and medium-induced splitting. the dynamics of the jet energy and momentum deposited into the medium is described by hydrodynamic equations with source terms. our detailed analysis indicates that collisional absorption (energy loss) tends to narrow the jet shape function while transverse momentum kicks and medium-induced radiations broaden the jet transverse profile. also, jet-induced flow plays a significant contribution to jet shape function and dominates at large angles away from the jet axis. the final nuclear modification pattern for the jet shape function is a combined effect from various jet-medium interaction mechanisms. our detailed studies for single inclusive jets and $\gamma$-jets for various kinematics indicate that the nuclear modification of jet shape has strong dependence on jet energy and collision energy, and weak dependence on jet flavor (quark or gluon)."
"suppression of elliptic anisotropy inside jets: a new perspective for jet quenching. particle azimuthal anisotropies inside jets, defined within the momentum plane perpendicular to the jet axis, carry the information of the qcd cascade process for jet formation. in this work, we propose to measure the medium-induced modifications of the elliptic anisotropy inside jets in relativistic heavy-ion collisions to provide novel insight into the jet quenching phenomenon. by simulating the jet propagation in the hot and dense nuclear medium with a linear boltzmann transport model, we observe a de-correlation in the two-particle azimuthal angular distribution for inclusive jet production in aa collisions relative to that in pp collisions, which results in significant suppression of the in-jet elliptic anisotropy coefficient $v_2$. this phenomenon arises from the stochastic and strong interactions with the thermal qgp medium undergone by the jet particles. furthermore, the nuclear modifications of the in-jet $v_2$ are found to be sensitive to the medium properties in the model study, which provide a potential probe for the jet tomography of nuclear matter."
