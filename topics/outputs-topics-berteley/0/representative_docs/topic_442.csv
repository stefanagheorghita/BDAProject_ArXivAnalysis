"scene invariant crowd segmentation and counting using scale-normalized histogram of moving gradients (homg). the problem of automated crowd segmentation and counting has garnered significant interest in the field of video surveillance. this paper proposes a novel scene invariant crowd segmentation and counting algorithm designed with high accuracy yet low computational complexity in mind, which is key for widespread industrial adoption. a novel low-complexity, scale-normalized feature called histogram of moving gradients (homg) is introduced for highly effective spatiotemporal representation of individuals and crowds within a video. real-time crowd segmentation is achieved via boosted cascade of weak classifiers based on sliding-window homg features, while linear svm regression of crowd-region homg features is employed for real-time crowd counting. experimental results using multi-camera crowd datasets show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperform state-of-the-art crowd counting algorithms, as well as achieve very promising crowd segmentation results, thus demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed method for highly-accurate, real-time video-driven crowd analysis."
"cascaded residual density network for crowd counting. crowd counting is a challenging task due to the issues such as scale variation and perspective variation in real crowd scenes. in this paper, we propose a novel cascaded residual density network (crdnet) in a coarse-to-fine approach to generate the high-quality density map for crowd counting more accurately. (1) we estimate the residual density maps by multi-scale pyramidal features through cascaded residual density modules. it can improve the quality of density map layer by layer effectively. (2) a novel additional local count loss is presented to refine the accuracy of crowd counting, which reduces the errors of pixel-wise euclidean loss by restricting the number of people in the local crowd areas. experiments on two public benchmark datasets show that the proposed method achieves effective improvement compared with the state-of-the-art methods."
"jhu-crowd++: large-scale crowd counting dataset and a benchmark method. due to its variety of applications in the real-world, the task of single image-based crowd counting has received a lot of interest in the recent years. recently, several approaches have been proposed to address various problems encountered in crowd counting. these approaches are essentially based on convolutional neural networks that require large amounts of data to train the network parameters. considering this, we introduce a new large scale unconstrained crowd counting dataset (jhu-crowd++) that contains ""4,372"" images with ""1.51 million"" annotations. in comparison to existing datasets, the proposed dataset is collected under a variety of diverse scenarios and environmental conditions. specifically, the dataset includes several images with weather-based degradations and illumination variations, making it a very challenging dataset. additionally, the dataset consists of a rich set of annotations at both image-level and head-level. several recent methods are evaluated and compared on this dataset. the dataset can be downloaded from http://www.crowd-counting.com . furthermore, we propose a novel crowd counting network that progressively generates crowd density maps via residual error estimation. the proposed method uses vgg16 as the backbone network and employs density map generated by the final layer as a coarse prediction to refine and generate finer density maps in a progressive fashion using residual learning. additionally, the residual learning is guided by an uncertainty-based confidence weighting mechanism that permits the flow of only high-confidence residuals in the refinement path. the proposed confidence guided deep residual counting network (cg-drcn) is evaluated on recent complex datasets, and it achieves significant improvements in errors."
