"a lower-than-expected saltation threshold at martian pressure and below. aeolian sediment transport is observed to occur on mars as well as other extraterrestrial environments, generating ripples and dunes as on earth. the search for terrestrial analogues of planetary bedforms, as well as environmental simulation experiments able to reproduce their formation in planetary conditions, are powerful ways to question our understanding of geomorphological processes towards unusual environmental conditions. here, we perform sediment transport laboratory experiments in a closed-circuit wind tunnel placed in a vacuum chamber and operated at extremely low pressures to show that martian conditions belong to a previously unexplored saltation regime. the threshold wind speed required to initiate saltation is only quantitatively predicted by state-of-the art models up to a density ratio between grain and air of $4 \times 10^5$, but unexpectedly falls to much lower values for higher density ratios. in contrast, impact ripples, whose emergence is continuously observed on the granular bed over the whole pressure range investigated, display a characteristic wavelength and propagation velocity essentially independent of pressure. a comparison of these findings with existing models suggests that sediment transport at low reynolds number but high grain-to-fluid density ratio may be dominated by collective effects associated with grain inertia in the granular collisional layer."
"measurements of the aeolian sand transport saturation length. the wavelength at which a dune pattern emerges from a flat sand bed is controlled by the sediment transport saturation length, which is the length needed for the sand flux to adapt to a change of wind strength. the influence of the wind shear velocity on this saturation length and on the subsequent dune initial wavelength has remained controversial. in this letter, we present direct measurements of the saturation length performed in a wind tunnel experiment. in complement, initial dune wavelengths are measured under different wind conditions -- in particular after storms. using the linear stability analysis of dune formation, it is then possible to deduce the saturation length from field data. both direct and indirect measurements agree that the saturation length is almost independent of the wind strength. this demonstrates that, in contrast with erosion, grain inertia is the dominant dynamical mechanism limiting sediment transport saturation."
"a predictive model for bubble-particle collisions in turbulence. the modelling of bubble-particle collisions is crucial to improving the efficiency of industrial processes such as froth flotation. although such systems usually have turbulent flows and the bubbles are typically much larger than the particles, there currently exist no predictive models for this case which consistently include finite-size effects in the interaction with the bubbles as well as inertial effects for the particles simultaneously. as a first step, jiang and krug (j. fluid mech., vol. 1006, 2025, a19) proposed a frozen turbulence approach which captures the collision rate between finite-size bubbles and inertial particles in homogeneous isotropic turbulence using the bubble slip velocity probability density function measured from simulations as an input. in this study, we further develop this approach into a model where the bubble-particle collision rate can be predicted a priori based on the bubble, particle, and turbulence properties. by comparing the predicted collision rate with simulations of bubbles with stokes numbers of 2.8 and 6.3, and particles with stokes numbers ranging from 0.01 to 2 in turbulence with a taylor reynolds number of 64, good agreement is found between model and simulations for froude number $fr \leq 0.25$. beyond this range of bubble stokes number, we propose a criterion for using our model and discuss the model's validity. evaluating our model at typical flotation parameters indicates that particle inertia and settling effects are usually important. generally, smaller bubbles, larger particles, and stronger turbulence increase the overall collision rate."
