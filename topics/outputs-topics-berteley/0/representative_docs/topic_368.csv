"equilibrium points and their linear stability in the planar equilateral restricted four-body problem: a review and new results. in this work, we revisit the planar restricted four-body problem to study the dynamics of an infinitesimal mass under the gravitational force produced by three heavy bodies with unequal masses, forming an equilateral triangle configuration. we unify known results about the existence and linear stability of equilibrium points of this problem which have been obtained earlier, either as relative equilibria or a central configuration of the planar restricted $(3 + 1)$-body problem. it is the first attempt in this direction. a systematic numerical investigation is performed to obtain the resonance curves in the mass space. we use these curves to answer the question about the existing boundary between the domains of linear stability and instability. the characterization of the total number of stable points found inside the stability domain is discussed."
"on the classification of orbits in the three-dimensional copenhagen problem with oblate primaries. the character of motion for the three-dimensional circular restricted three-body problem with oblate primaries is investigated. the orbits of the test particle are classified into four types: non-escaping regular orbits around the primaries, trapped chaotic (or sticky) orbits, escaping orbits that pass over the lagrange saddle points $l_2$ and $l_3$, and orbits that lead the test particle to collide with one of the primary bodies. we numerically explore the motion of the test particle by presenting color-coded diagrams, where the initial conditions are mapped to the orbit type and studied as a function of the total orbital energy, the initial value of the $z$-coordinate and the oblateness coefficient. the fraction of the collision orbits, measured on the color-coded diagrams, show an algebraic dependence on the oblateness coefficient, which can be derived by simple semi-theoretical arguments."
"second-species dynamics in the restricted planar circular three body problem: chaos, final motions and periodic orbits. consider the restricted planar circular three body problem (rpc3bp), which models the motion of a massless particle (asteroid) under the gravitational influence of two massive bodies (the primaries) moving on circular orbits. by considering the ratio between the masses of the primaries to be arbitrarily small, we construct orbits with close encounters with the smaller primary (jupiter) that realize any combination of past and future final motions (in the sense of chazy's), including oscillatory motions. we also obtain arbitrarily large ejection-collision orbits with jupiter and ejection-collision orbits between the two primaries (sun and jupiter), as well as arbitrarily large periodic orbits that pass arbitrarily close to jupiter. our approach combines singular perturbation theory and levi-civita regularization near jupiter, and mcgehee regularization near infinity and near the sun, together with a global analysis that leads to transverse intersections of invariant manifolds."
