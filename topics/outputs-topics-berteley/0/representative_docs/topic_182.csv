"chemical abundances of main-sequence, turn-off, subgiant and red giant stars from apogee spectra i: signatures of diffusion in the open cluster m67. detailed chemical abundance distributions for fourteen elements are derived for eight high-probability stellar members of the solar metallicity old open cluster m67 with an age of $\sim$4 gyr. the eight stars consist of four pairs, with each pair occupying a distinct phase of stellar evolution: two g-dwarfs, two turnoff stars, two g-subgiants, and two red clump k-giants. the abundance analysis uses near-ir high-resolution spectra ($\lambda$1.5 -- 1.7$\mu$m) from the apogee survey and derives abundances for c, n, o, na, mg, al, si, k, ca, ti, v, cr, mn, and fe. our derived stellar parameters and metallicity for 2m08510076+113115 suggest that this star is a solar-twin, exhibiting abundance differences relative to the sun of $\leq$ 0.04 dex for all elements. chemical homogeneity is found within each class of stars ($\sim$0.02 dex), while significant abundance variations ($\sim$0.05 -- 0.20 dex) are found across the different evolutionary phases; the turnoff stars typically have the lowest abundances, while the red clump tend to have the largest. non-lte corrections to the lte-derived abundances are unlikely to explain the differences. a detailed comparison of the derived fe, mg, si, and ca abundances with recently published surface abundances from stellar models that include chemical diffusion, provides a good match between the observed and predicted abundances as a function of stellar mass. such agreement would indicate the detection of chemical diffusion processes in the stellar members of m67."
"characterizing the companion agbs using surface chemical composition of barium stars. barium stars are one of the important probes to understand the origin and evolution of slow neutron-capture process elements in the galaxy. these are extrinsic stars, where the observed s-process element abundances are believed to have an origin in the now invisible companions that produced these elements at their asymptotic giant branch phase of evolution. we have attempted to understand the s-process nucleosynthesis, as well as the physical properties of the companion stars through a detailed comparison of observed elemental abundances of 10 barium stars with the predictions from agb nucleosynthesis models, fruity. for these stars, we have presented estimates of abundances of several elements, c, n, o, na, al, $\alpha$-elements, fe-peak elements and neutron-capture elements rb, sr, y, zr, ba, la, ce, pr, nd, sm and eu. the abundance estimates are based on high resolution spectral analysis. observations of rb in four of these stars have allowed us to put a limit to the mass of the companion agb stars. our analysis clearly shows that the former companions responsible for the surface abundance peculiarities of these stars are low-mass agb stars. kinematic analysis have shown the stars to be members of galactic disk population."
"chemical evolution of r-process elements in stars (ceres) ii. the impact of stellar evolution and rotation on light and heavy elements. context. carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen are the most abundant elements throughout the universe, after hydrogen and helium. studying these elements in low-metallicity stars can provide crucial information on the chemical composition in the early galaxy and possible internal mixing processes that can alter the surface composition of the stars. aims. this work aims to investigate the chemical abundance patterns for cno elements and li in a homogeneously analyzed sample of 52 metal-poor halo giant stars. methods. we used high-resolution spectra with a high signal-to-noise ratio (s/n) to carry out a spectral synthesis to derive detailed c, n, o, and li abundances for a sample of stars with metallicities in the range of -3.58 <= [fe/h] <= -1.79 dex. our study was based on the assumption of one-dimensional (1d) local thermodynamic equilibrium (lte) atmospheres. results. based on carbon and nitrogen abundances, we investigated the deep mixing taking place within stars along the red giant branch (rgb). the individual abundances of carbon decrease towards the upper rgb while nitrogen shows an increasing trend, indicating that carbon has been converted into nitrogen. no signatures of on-cycle processed material were found for the stars in our sample. we computed a set of galactic chemical evolution (gce) models, implementing different sets of massive star yields, both with and without including the effects of stellar rotation on nucleosynthesis. we confirm that stellar rotation is necessary to explain the highest [n/fe] and [n/o] ratios observed in unmixed halo stars. the predicted level of n enhancement varies sensibly in dependence of the specific set of yields that are adopted. for stars with stellar parameters similar to those of our sample, heavy elements such as sr, y, and zr appear to have unchanged abundances despite the stellar evolution mixing processes."
