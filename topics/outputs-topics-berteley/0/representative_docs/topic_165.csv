"achieving data dissemination with security using fiware and intel software guard extensions (sgx). the internet of things (iot) field has gained much attention from industry and academia, being the main subject for numerous research and development projects. frequently, the dense amount of generated data from iot applications is sent to a cloud service, that is responsible for processing and storage. many of these applications demand security and privacy for their data because of their sensitive nature. this is specially true when such data must be processed in entities hosted in public clouds, where the environment in which applications run may not be trusted. some concerns are then raised since it is not trivial to provide the needed protection for these sensitive data. we present a solution that considers the security components of fiware and the intel sgx capabilities. fiware is a platform created to support the development of smart applications, including iot systems, and sgx is the intel solution for trusted execution environment (tee). we propose a new component for key management that, together with other fiware components, can be used to provide privacy, confidentiality, and integrity guarantees for iot data. a case study illustrates how this proposed solution can be employed in a realistic scenario, which allows the dissemination of sensitive data through public clouds without risking privacy issues. the results of the experiments provide evidence that our approach does not harm scalability or availability of the system. in addition, it presents acceptable memory costs when considering the benefit of the privacy guarantees achieved."
"physical and software based fault injection attacks against tees in mobile devices: a systemisation of knowledge. trusted execution environments (tees) are critical components of modern secure computing, providing isolated zones in processors to safeguard sensitive data and execute secure operations. despite their importance, tees are increasingly vulnerable to fault injection (fi) attacks, including both physical methods, such as electromagnetic fault injection (emfi), and software-based techniques. this survey examines these fi methodologies, exploring their ability to disrupt tee operations and expose vulnerabilities in devices ranging from smartphones and iot systems to cloud platforms. the study highlights the evolution and effectiveness of non-invasive techniques, such as emfi, which induce faults through electromagnetic disturbances without physical modifications to hardware, making them harder to detect and mitigate. real-world case studies illustrate the significant risks posed by these attacks, including unauthorised access, privilege escalation, and data corruption. in addition, the survey identifies gaps in existing tee security architectures and emphasises the need for enhanced countermeasures, such as dynamic anomaly detection and updated threat models. the findings underline the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration to address these vulnerabilities, involving researchers, manufacturers, and policymakers. this survey provides actionable insights and recommendations to guide the development of more robust tee architectures in mobile devices, fortify fi resilience, and shape global security standards. by advancing tee security, this research aims to protect critical digital infrastructure and maintain trust in secure computing systems worldwide."
"modern hardware security: a review of attacks and countermeasures. with the exponential rise in the use of cloud services, smart devices, and iot devices, advanced cyber attacks have become increasingly sophisticated and ubiquitous. furthermore, the rapid evolution of computing architectures and memory technologies has created an urgent need to understand and address hardware security vulnerabilities. in this paper, we review the current state of vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies in contemporary computing systems. we discuss cache side-channel attacks (including spectre and meltdown), power side-channel attacks (such as simple power analysis, differential power analysis, correlation power analysis, and template attacks), and advanced techniques like voltage glitching and electromagnetic analysis to help understand and build robust cybersecurity defense systems and guide further research. we also examine memory encryption, focusing on confidentiality, granularity, key management, masking, and re-keying strategies. additionally, we cover cryptographic instruction set architectures, secure boot, root of trust mechanisms, physical unclonable functions, and hardware fault injection techniques. the paper concludes with an analysis of the risc-v architecture's unique security challenges. the comprehensive analysis presented in this paper is essential for building resilient hardware security solutions that can protect against both current and emerging threats in an increasingly challenging security landscape."
