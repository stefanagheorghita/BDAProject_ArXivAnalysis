"robust control of high-dimensional quantum systems against coherent and incoherent errors. toward scalable quantum computing, the control of quantum systems needs to be robust against both coherent errors induced by parametric uncertainties and incoherent errors induced by environmental decoherence. this poses significant challenges for high-dimensional systems due to the computational intensity involved in the control design process. in this paper, we propose a systematic framework to improve the design efficiency. by employing the taylor series expansion of uncertain parameters, the problem of robust control for an uncertain quantum system is reformulated as the optimal control problem of an augmented deterministic system. the suzuki-trotter expansion is then applied to accelerate the calculation of the system dynamics. numerical simulations of quantum state preparation and quantum gate synthesis demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can successfully identify robust solutions in multi-qubit systems. the enhanced efficiency effectively extends the feasibility of high-order robust control for realistic high-dimensional quantum systems with multiple error sources."
"compressed quantum computation using the ibm quantum experience. the notion of compressed quantum computation is employed to simulate the ising interaction of a 1d--chain consisting out of $n$ qubits using the universal ibm cloud quantum computer running on $\log(n)$ qubits. the external field parameter that controls the quantum phase transition of this model translates into particular settings of the quantum gates that generate the circuit. we measure the magnetization, which displays the quantum phase transition, on a two--qubit system, which simulates a four--qubit ising chain, and show its agreement with the theoretical prediction within a certain error. we also discuss the relevant point of how to assess errors when using a cloud quantum computer. as a solution, we propose to use validating circuits, that is to run independent controlled quantum circuits of similar complexity to the circuit of interest."
"optimal control theory for continuous variable quantum gates. we apply the methodology of optimal control theory to the problem of implementing quantum gates in continuous variable systems with quadratic hamiltonians. we demonstrate that it is possible to define a fidelity measure for continuous variable (cv) gate optimization that is devoid of traps, such that the search for optimal control fields using local algorithms will not be hindered. the optimal control of several quantum computing gates, as well as that of algorithms composed of these primitives, is investigated using several typical physical models and compared for discrete and continuous quantum systems. numerical simulations indicate that the optimization of generic cv quantum gates is inherently more expensive than that of generic discrete variable quantum gates, and that the exact-time controllability of cv systems plays an important role in determining the maximum achievable gate fidelity. the resulting optimal control fields typically display more complicated fourier spectra that suggest a richer variety of possible control mechanisms. moreover, the ability to control interactions between qunits is important for delimiting the total control fluence. the comparative ability of current experimental protocols to implement such time-dependent controls may help determine which physical incarnations of cv quantum information processing will be the easiest to implement with optimal fidelity."
