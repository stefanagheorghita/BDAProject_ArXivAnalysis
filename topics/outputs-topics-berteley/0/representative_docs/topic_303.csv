"high-statistics modeling of complex pedestrian avoidance scenarios. quantitatively modeling the trajectories and behavior of pedestrians walking in crowds is an outstanding fundamental challenge deeply connected with the physics of flowing active matter, from a scientific point of view, and having societal applications entailing individual safety and comfort, from an application perspective. in this contribution, we review a pedestrian dynamics modeling approach, previously proposed by the authors, aimed at reproducing some of the statistical features of pedestrian motion. comparing with high-statistics pedestrian dynamics measurements collected in real-life conditions (from hundreds of thousands to millions of trajectories), we modeled quantitatively the statistical features of the undisturbed motion (i.e. in absence of interactions with other pedestrians) as well as the avoidance dynamics triggered by a pedestrian incoming in the opposite direction. this was accomplished through (coupled) langevin equations with potentials including multiple preferred velocity states and preferred paths. in this chapter we review this model, discussing some of its limitations, in view of its extension toward a more complex case: the avoidance dynamics of a single pedestrian walking through a crowd that is moving in the opposite direction. we analyze some of the challenges connected to this case and present extensions to the model capable of reproducing some features of the motion."
"determination of pedestrian flow performance based on video tracking and microscopic simulations. one of the objectives of understanding pedestrian behavior is to predict the effect of proposed changes in the design or evaluation of pedestrian facilities. we want to know the impact to the user of the facilities, as the design of the facilities change. that impact was traditionally evaluated by level of service standards. another design criterion to measure the impact of design change is measured by the pedestrian flow performance index. this paper describes the determination of pedestrian flow performance based video tracking or any microscopic pedestrian simulation models. most of pedestrian researches have been done on a macroscopic level, which is an aggregation of all pedestrian movement in pedestrian areas into flow, average speed and area module. macroscopic level, however, does not consider the interaction between pedestrians. it is also not well suited for prediction of pedestrian flow performance in pedestrian areas or in buildings with some obstruction, that reduces the effective width of the walkways. on the other hand, the microscopic level has a more general usage and considers detail in the design. more efficient pedestrian flow can even be reached with less space. those results have rejected the linearity assumption of space and flow in the macroscopic level."
"models for pedestrian behavior. the behavior of pedestrians shows certain regularities, which can be described by quantitative (partly stochastic) models. the models are based on the behavior of individual pedestrians, which depends on the pedestrian intentions and on the aspects of movement. the pedestrian intentions concerning a sequence of destinations are influenced by the demand for certain kinds of commodities, by the location of stores selling these, and by the expenditures to get the required commodities. the actual pedestrian movement starts and ends at special city entry points like parking lots. it is guided by the pedestrian intentions, but is subject to deceleration processes and avoidance maneuvers due to obstacles. as a consequence, the pedestrians have to speed up to reach the next destination well-timed. in addition, the pedestrian behavior is influenced by unexpected attractions (e.g. street artists). the model for the behavior of individual pedestrians is an ideal starting point for computer simulations of pedestrian crowds. such simulations take into account the limited capacity of pedestrian ways and places, and allow to determine an optimal design of pedestrian areas and an optimal arrangement of store locations. therefore, they can be applied for town- and traffic-planning. the model for the behavior of individual pedestrians also allows the derivation of mathematical equations for pedestrian crowds and for pedestrian groups. pedestrian crowds can be described by a stochastic formulation, by a gaskinetic formulation or by a fluiddynamic formulation. the gaskinetic formulation (mezoscopic level) can be derived from the stochastic formulation (microscopic level), and the fluiddynamic formulation (macroscopic level) from the gaskinetic formulation."
