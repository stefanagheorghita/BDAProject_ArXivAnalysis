"survey on network virtualization hypervisors for software defined networking. software defined networking (sdn) has emerged as a promising paradigm for making the control of communication networks flexible. sdn separates the data packet forwarding plane, i.e., the data plane, from the control plane and employs a central controller. network virtualization allows the flexible sharing of physical networking resources by multiple users (tenants). each tenant runs its own applications over its virtual network, i.e., its slice of the actual physical network. the virtualization of sdn networks promises to allow networks to leverage the combined benefits of sdn networking and network virtualization and has therefore attracted significant research attention in recent years. a critical component for virtualizing sdn networks is an sdn hypervisor that abstracts the underlying physical sdn network into multiple logically isolated virtual sdn networks (vsdns), each with its own controller. we comprehensively survey hypervisors for sdn networks in this article. we categorize the sdn hypervisors according to their architecture into centralized and distributed hypervisors. we furthermore sub-classify the hypervisors according to their execution platform into hypervisors running exclusively on general-purpose compute platforms, or on a combination of general-purpose compute platforms with general- or special-purpose network elements. we exhaustively compare the network attribute abstraction and isolation features of the existing sdn hypervisors. as part of the future research agenda, we outline the development of a performance evaluation framework for sdn hypervisors."
"comparative advantage driven resource allocation for virtual network functions. as communication service providers (csps) adopt the network function virtualization (nfv) paradigm, they need to transition their network function capacity to a virtualized infrastructure with different network functions running on a set of heterogeneous servers. this abstract describes a novel technique for allocating server resources (compute, storage and network) for a given set of virtual network function (vnf) requirements. our approach helps the telco providers decide the most effective way to run several vnfs on servers with different performance characteristics. our analysis of prior vnf performance characterization on heterogeneous/different server resource allocations shows that the ability to arbitrarily create many vnfs among different servers' resource allocations leads to a comparative advantage among servers. we propose a vnf resource allocation method called compare that maximizes the total throughput of the system by formulating this resource allocation problem as a comparative advantage problem among heterogeneous servers. there several applications for using the vnf resource allocation from compare including transitioning current telco deployments to nfv based solutions and providing initial vnf placement for service function chain (sfc) provisioning."
"online service provisioning in nfv-enabled networks using deep reinforcement learning. in this paper, we study a deep reinforcement learning (drl) based framework for an online end-user service provisioning in a network function virtualization (nfv)-enabled network. we formulate an optimization problem aiming to minimize the cost of network resource utilization. the main challenge is provisioning the online service requests by fulfilling their quality of service (qos) under limited resource availability. moreover, fulfilling the stochastic service requests in a large network is another challenge that is evaluated in this paper. to solve the formulated optimization problem in an efficient and intelligent manner, we propose a deep q-network for adaptive resource allocation (dqn-ar) in nfv-enable network for function placement and dynamic routing which considers the available network resources as dqn states. moreover, the service's characteristics, including the service life time and number of the arrival requests, are modeled by the uniform and exponential distribution, respectively. in addition, we evaluate the computational complexity of the proposed method. numerical results carried out for different ranges of parameters reveal the effectiveness of our framework. in specific, the obtained results show that the average number of admitted requests of the network increases by 7 up to 14% and the network utilization cost decreases by 5 and 20 %."
