"surface reconstruction limited conductivity in block-copolymer li battery electrolytes. solid polymer electrolytes for lithium batteries promise improvements in safety and energy density if their conductivity can be increased. nanostructured block copolymer electrolytes specifically have the potential to provide both good ionic conductivity and good mechanical properties. this study shows that the previously neglected nanoscale composition of the polymer electrolyte close to the electrode surface has an important effect on impedance measurements, despite its negligible extent compared to the bulk electrolyte. using standard stainless steel blocking electrodes, the impedance of lithium salt-doped poly(isoprene-b-styrene-b-ethylene oxide) (iso) exhibited a marked decrease upon thermal processing of the electrolyte. in contrast, covering the electrode surface with a low molecular weight poly(ethylene oxide) (peo) brush resulted in higher and more reproducible conductivity values, which were insensitive to the thermal history of the device. a qualitative model of this effect is based on the hypothesis that iso surface reconstruction at the different electrode surfaces leads to a change in the electrostatic double layer, affecting electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements. as a main result, peo-brush modification of electrode surfaces is beneficial for the robust electrolyte performance of peo-containing block-copolymers and may be crucial for their accurate characterization and use in li-ion batteries."
"theory of layered-oxide cathode degradation in li-ion batteries by oxidation-induced cation disorder. disorder-driven degradation phenomena, such as structural phase transformations and surface reconstructions, can significantly reduce the lifetime of li-ion batteries, especially those with nickel-rich layered-oxide cathodes. we develop a general free energy model for layered-oxide ion-intercalation materials as a function of the degree of disorder, which represents the density of defects in the host crystal. the model accounts for defect core energies, long-range dipolar electrostatic forces, and configurational entropy of the solid solution. in the case of nickel-rich oxides, we hypothesize that nickel with a high concentration of defects is driven into the bulk by electrostatic forces as oxidation reactions at the solid-electrolyte interface reduce nickel and either evolve oxygen gas or oxidize the organic electrolyte at high potentials (>4.4v vs. li/li+). the model is used in battery cycling simulations to describe the extent of cathode degradation when using different voltage cutoffs, in agreement with experimental observations that lower-voltage cycling can substantially reduce cathode degradation. the theory provides a framework to guide the development of cathode compositions, coatings and electrolytes to enhance rate capability and enhance battery lifetime. the general theory of cation-disorder formation may also find applications in electrochemical water treatment and ion separations, such as lithium extraction from brines, based on competitive ion intercalation in battery materials."
"polymer-based solid-state electrolytes for lithium sulfur batteries. lithium-sulfur (li-s) batteries offer substantial theoretical energy density gains over li-ion bat-teries, a crucial factor for transportation electrification. in addition, sulfur is an earth-abundant, inexpensive material obtainable from multiple resources; thus, li-s batteries are envisioned to provide environmentally sustainable solutions to the growing demand for energy storage. a crit-ical roadblock to the realization of commercial li-s batteries is the formation of polysulfides and their secondary reactions with liquid organic electrolytes, resulting in low coulombic efficiency for charging and fast self-discharge rates. the realization of solid-state electrolytes for li-s bat-teries provides potential pathways to address the safety concerns of liquid electrolytes and inhib-it the formation of polysulfides and/or prevent their diffusion into the anode electrode. however, current solid-state electrolytes are limited by low ionic conductivity, inadequate electrode inter-facial compatibility, and restricted electrochemical windows. this review discusses the status of polymer-based electrolytes for li-s batteries, and outlines current methods for their fabrication, their transport characteristics and ongoing research aimed at overcoming material properties hindering the development of all-solid-state li-s batteries."
