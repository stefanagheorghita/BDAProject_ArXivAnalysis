"theory of the lamb shift in hydrogen and light hydrogen-like ions. theoretical calculations of the lamb shift provide the basis required for the determination of the rydberg constant from spectroscopic measurements in hydrogen. the recent high-precision determination of the proton charge radius drastically reduced the uncertainty in the hydrogen lamb shift originating from the proton size. as a result, the dominant theoretical uncertainty now comes from the two- and three-loop qed effects, which calls for further advances in their calculations. we review the present status of theoretical calculations of the lamb shift in hydrogen and light hydrogen-like ions with the nuclear charge number up to $z = 5$. theoretical errors due to various effects are critically examined and estimated."
"qed theory of the nuclear magnetic shielding in hydrogen-like ions. the shielding of the nuclear magnetic moment by the bound electron in hydrogen-like ions is calculated ab initio with inclusion of relativistic, nuclear, and quantum electrodynamics (qed) effects. the qed correction is evaluated to all orders in the nuclear binding strength parameter and, independently, to the first order in the expansion in this parameter. the results obtained lay the basis for the high-precision determination of nuclear magnetic dipole moments from measurements of the g-factor of hydrogen-like ions."
"finite nuclear size correction to the bound-electron g factor in a hydrogenlike atom. the finite nuclear size correction to the bound-electron g factor in hydrogenlike atoms is investigated in the range z=1-20. an analytical formula for this correction which includes the non-relativistic and dominant relativistic contributions is derived. in the case of the 1s state, the results obtained by this formula are compared with previous non-relativistic analytical and relativistic numerical calculations."
