"signature of majorana fermions in charge transport in semiconductor nanowires. we investigate the charge transport in a semiconductor nanowire that is subject to a perpendicular magnetic field and in partial contact with an \textit{s}-wave superconductor. we find that majorana fermions, existing at the interface between superconducting and normal sections of the nanowire within certain parameter region, can induce resonant andreev reflection of electrons at the interface, which yields a zero energy peak in the electrical conductance of the nanowire. the width of the zero energy conductance peak for different experimental parameters is characterized. while the zero energy peak provides a signature for majorana fermions in one dimensional nanowires, it disappears in a two-dimensional semiconductor thin film with the same experimental setup because of the existence of other edge states in two dimensions. the proposed charge transport experiment may provide a simple and experimentally feasible method for the detection of majorana fermions in semiconductor nanowires."
"electric field tunable superconductor-semiconductor coupling in majorana nanowires. we study the effect of external electric fields on superconductor-semiconductor coupling by measuring the electron transport in insb semiconductor nanowires coupled to an epitaxially grown al superconductor. we find that the gate voltage induced electric fields can greatly modify the coupling strength, which has consequences for the proximity induced superconducting gap, effective g-factor, and spin-orbit coupling, which all play a key role in understanding majorana physics. we further show that level repulsion due to spin-orbit coupling in a finite size system can lead to seemingly stable zero bias conductance peaks, which mimic the behavior of majorana zero modes. our results improve the understanding of realistic majorana nanowire systems."
"quantum engineering of majorana fermions. chiral superconductors have the ability to host topologically protected majorana zero modes which have been proposed as future qubits for topological quantum computing. the recently introduced magnet--superconductor hybrid (msh) systems consisting of magnetic adatoms deposited on the surface of conventional $s$-wave superconductors represent a promising candidate for the creation, detection, and manipulation of majorana modes via scanning tunneling microscopy techniques. here, we present four examples demonstrating the ability to engineer majorana fermions in nanoscopic msh systems by using atomic manipulation techniques to change the system's shape or magnetic structure. this allows for the dimensional tuning of majorana modes between one and two dimensions, the identification of the system's topological invariant -- the chern number -- in real space, the creation of chiral majorana modes of arbitrary length and shape along magnetic domain boundaries, and the creation of a topological switch using magnetic skyrmions. these examples of majorana fermion engineering can be realised with current experimental techniques and will promise new avenues for the first prototypes of majorana-based quantum devices."
