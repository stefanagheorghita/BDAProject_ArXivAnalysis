"orbispaces, orthogonal spaces, and the universal compact lie group. this paper identifies the homotopy theories of topological stacks and orbispaces with unstable global homotopy theory. at the same time, we provide a new perspective by interpreting it as the homotopy theory of `spaces with an action of the universal compact lie group'. the upshot is a novel way to construct and study genuine cohomology theories on stacks, orbifolds, and orbispaces, defined from stable global homotopy types represented by orthogonal spectra. the universal compact lie group (which is neither compact nor a lie group) is a well known object, namely the topological monoid $\mathcal l$ of linear isometric self-embeddings of $\mathbb r^\infty$. the underlying space of $\mathcal l$ is contractible, and the homotopy theory of $\mathcal l$-spaces with respect to underlying weak equivalences is just another model for the homotopy theory of spaces. however, the monoid $\mathcal l$ contains copies of all compact lie groups in a specific way, and we define global equivalences of $\mathcal l$-spaces by testing on corresponding fixed points. we establish a global model structure on the category of $\mathcal l$-spaces and prove it to be quillen equivalent to the global model category of orthogonal spaces, and to the category of orbispaces, i.e., presheaves of spaces on the global orbit category."
"kuranishi homology and kuranishi cohomology. a kuranishi space is a topological space with a kuranishi structure, defined by fukaya and ono. kuranishi structures occur naturally on moduli spaces of j-holomorphic curves in symplectic geometry. let y be an orbifold and r a commutative ring or q-algebra. we define two kinds of kuranishi homology kh_*(y;r). the chain complex kc_*(y;r) defining kh_*(y;r) is spanned over r by [x,f,g], for x a compact oriented kuranishi space with corners, f : x --> y smooth, and g ""gauge-fixing data"" which makes aut(x,f,g) finite. our main result is that these are isomorphic to singular homology. we define poincare dual kuranishi cohomology, isomorphic to compactly-supported cohomology. we define five kinds of kuranishi (co)bordism spanned by isomorphism classes[x,f] for x a compact oriented kuranishi space without boundary and f : x --> y smooth. they are new topological invariants, and we show they are very large. these theories are powerful new tools in symplectic geometry. defining virtual cycles and chains for moduli spaces of j-holomorphic curves is trivial in kuranishi (co)homology. there is no need to perturb moduli spaces, and no problems with transversality. this gives major simplifications in lagrangian floer cohomology. we define new gromov-witten type invariants in kuranishi bordism, over z not q. we sketch how these may be used to prove the integrality conjecture for gopakumar-vafa invariants. this paper is surveyed in arxiv:0710.5634."
"isomorphisms in l^1-homology. taking the l^1-completion and the topological dual of the singular chain complex gives rise to l^1-homology and bounded cohomology respectively. in contrast to l^1-homology, major structural properties of bounded cohomology are well understood by the work of gromov and ivanov. based on an observation by matsumoto and morita, we derive a mechanism linking isomorphisms on the level of homology of banach chain complexes to isomorphisms on the level of cohomology of the dual banach cochain complexes and vice versa. therefore, certain results on bounded cohomology can be transferred to l^1-homology. for example, we obtain a new proof of the fact that l^1-homology depends only on the fundamental group and that l^1-homology with twisted coefficients admits a description in terms of projective resolutions. the latter one in particular fills a gap in park's approach. in the second part, we demonstrate how l^1-homology can be used to get a better understanding of simplicial volume of non-compact manifolds."
