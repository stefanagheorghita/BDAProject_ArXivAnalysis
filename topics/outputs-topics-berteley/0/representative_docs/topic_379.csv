"the fisher-kpp problem with doubly nonlinear diffusion. the famous fisher-kpp reaction-diffusion model combines linear diffusion with the typical kpp reaction term, and appears in a number of relevant applications in biology and chemistry. it is remarkable as a mathematical model since it possesses a family of travelling waves that describe the asymptotic behaviour of a large class solutions $0\le u(x,t)\le 1$ of the problem posed in the real line. the existence of propagation waves with finite speed has been confirmed in some related models and disproved in others. we investigate here the corresponding theory when the linear diffusion is replaced by the ""slow"" doubly nonlinear diffusion and we find travelling waves that represent the wave propagation of more general solutions even when we extend the study to several space dimensions. a similar study is performed in the critical case that we call ""pseudo-linear"", i.e., when the operator is still nonlinear but has homogeneity one. with respect to the classical model and the ""pseudo-linear"" case, the ""slow"" travelling waves exhibit free boundaries."
"pulsating fronts for nonlocal dispersion and kpp nonlinearity. in this paper we are interested in propagation phenomena for nonlocal reaction-diffusion equations of the type: $\delta_tu = j \times u - u + f (x, u) t \in r^+, x \in r^n$, where j is a probability density and f is a kpp nonlinearity periodic in the x variables. under suitable assumptions we establish the existence of pulsating fronts describing the invasion of the 0 state by a heterogeneous state. we also give a variational characterization of the minimal speed of such pulsating fronts and exponential bounds on the asymptotic behavior of the solution."
"existence and asymptotic behavior of solutions to a semilinear hyperbolic-parabolic model of chemotaxis. we consider a general hyperbolic model of chemotaxis in the multidimensional case. for this system we show the global existence of smooth solutions to the cauchy problem and we determine their asymptotic behavior. since this model does not enter in the classical framework of dissipative problems, we analyze it combining the features of the hyperbolic and the parabolic parts and using detailed decay estimates of the green function."
