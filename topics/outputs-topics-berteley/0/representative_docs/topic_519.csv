"exact partition functions for the $\omega$-deformed $\mathcal n=2^{*}$ $su(2)$ gauge theory. we study the low energy effective action of the $\omega$-deformed $\mathcal n =2^{*}$ $su(2) $ gauge theory. it depends on the deformation parameters $\epsilon_{1},\epsilon_{2}$, the scalar field expectation value $a$, and the hypermultiplet mass $m$. we explore the plane $(\frac{m}{\epsilon_{1}}, \frac{\epsilon_{2}}{\epsilon_{1}})$ looking for special features in the multi-instanton contributions to the prepotential, motivated by what happens in the nekrasov-shatashvili limit $\epsilon_{2}\to 0$. we propose a simple condition on the structure of poles of the $k$-instanton prepotential and show that it is admissible at a finite set of points in the above plane. at these special points, the prepotential has poles at fixed positions independent on the instanton number. besides and remarkably, both the instanton partition function and the full prepotential, including the perturbative contribution, may be given in closed form as functions of the scalar expectation value $a$ and the modular parameter $q$ appearing in special combinations of eisenstein series and dedekind $\eta$ function. as a byproduct, the modular anomaly equation can be tested at all orders at these points. we discuss these special features from the point of view of the agt correspondence and provide explicit toroidal 1-blocks in non-trivial closed form. the full list of solutions with 1, 2, 3, and 4 poles is determined and described in details."
"deformed n=2 theories, generalized recursion relations and s-duality. we study the non-perturbative properties of n=2 super conformal field theories in four dimensions using localization techniques. in particular we consider su(2) gauge theories, deformed by a generic epsilon-background, with four fundamental flavors or with one adjoint hypermultiplet. in both cases we explicitly compute the first few instanton corrections to the partition function and the prepotential using nekrasov's approach. these results allow to reconstruct exact expressions involving quasi-modular functions of the bare gauge coupling constant and to show that the prepotential terms satisfy a modular anomaly equation that takes the form of a recursion relation with an explicitly epsilon-dependent term. we then investigate the implications of this recursion relation on the modular properties of the effective theory and find that with a suitable redefinition of the prepotential and of the effective coupling it is possible, at least up to the third order in the deformation parameters, to cast the s-duality relations in the same form as they appear in the seiberg-witten solution of the undeformed theory."
"$tt^*$ toda equations for surface defects in ${\mathcal n}=2$ sym and instanton counting for classical lie groups. the partition function of $\mathcal{n}=2$ super yang-mills theories with arbitrary simple gauge group coupled to a self-dual $\omega$-background is shown to be fully determined by studying the renormalization group equations relevant to the surface operators generating its one-form symmetries. the corresponding system of equations results in a ${\it non-autonomous}$ toda chain on the root system of the langlands dual, the evolution parameter being the rg scale. a systematic algorithm computing the full multi-instanton corrections is derived in terms of recursion relations whose gauge theoretical solution is obtained just by fixing the perturbative part of the ir prepotential as its asymptotic boundary condition for the rge. we analyse the explicit solutions of the $\tau$-system for all the classical groups at the diverse levels, extend our analysis to affine twisted lie algebras and provide conjectural bilinear relations for the $\tau$-functions of linear quiver gauge theory."
