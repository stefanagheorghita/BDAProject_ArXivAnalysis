"polynomial degree vs. quantum query complexity. the degree of a polynomial representing (or approximating) a function f is a lower bound for the number of quantum queries needed to compute f. this observation has been a source of many lower bounds on quantum algorithms. it has been an open problem whether this lower bound is tight. we exhibit a function with polynomial degree m and quantum query complexity \omega(m^{1.321...}). this is the first superlinear separation between polynomial degree and quantum query complexity. the lower bound is shown by a new, more general version of quantum adversary method."
"classical and quantum query complexity of boolean functions under indefinite causal order. computational models typically assume that operations are applied in a fixed sequential order. in recent years several works have looked at relaxing this assumption, considering computations without any fixed causal structure and showing that such ''causally indefinite'' computations can provide advantages in various tasks. recently, the quantum query complexity of boolean functions has been used as a tool to probe their computational power in a standard complexity theoretic framework, but no separation in exact query complexity has thus-far been found. in this paper, we investigate this problem starting with the simpler and fully classical notion of deterministic query complexity of boolean functions, and using classical-deterministic processes -- which may exhibit causal indefiniteness -- as a generalised computational framework. we first show that the standard polynomial and certificate lower bounds of deterministic query complexity also hold in such generalised models. then, we formulate a boolean function for which causal indefiniteness permits a reduction in query complexity and show that this advantage can be amplified into a polynomial separation. finally, with the insights gained in the classical-deterministic setting, we give a boolean function whose quantum query complexity is reduced by causally indefinite computations."
"how low can approximate degree and quantum query complexity be for total boolean functions?. it has long been known that any boolean function that depends on n input variables has both degree and exact quantum query complexity of omega(log n), and that this bound is achieved for some functions. in this paper we study the case of approximate degree and bounded-error quantum query complexity. we show that for these measures the correct lower bound is omega(log n / loglog n), and we exhibit quantum algorithms for two functions where this bound is achieved."
