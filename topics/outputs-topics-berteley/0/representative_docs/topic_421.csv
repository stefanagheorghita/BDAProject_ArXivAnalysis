"exploiting full/half-duplex user relaying in noma systems. in this paper, a novel cooperative non-orthogonal multiple access (noma) system is proposed, where one near user is employed as decode-and-forward (df) relaying switching between full-duplex (fd) and half-duplex (hd) mode to help a far user. two representative cooperative relaying scenarios are investigated insightfully. the \emph{first scenario} is that no direct link exists between the base station (bs) and far user. the \emph{second scenario} is that the direct link exists between the bs and far user. to characterize the performance of potential gains brought by fd noma in two considered scenarios, three performance metrics outage probability, ergodic rate and energy efficiency are discussed. more particularly, we derive new closed-form expressions for both exact and asymptotic outage probabilities as well as delay-limited throughput for two noma users. based on the derived results, the diversity orders achieved by users are obtained. we confirm that the use of direct link overcomes zero diversity order of far noma user inherent to fd relaying. additionally, we derive new closed-form expressions for asymptotic ergodic rates. based on these, the high signal-to-noise radio (snr) slopes of two users for fd noma are obtained. simulation results demonstrate that: 1) fd noma is superior to hd noma in terms of outage probability and ergodic sum rate in the low snr region; and 2) in delay-limited transmission mode, fd noma has higher energy efficiency than hd noma in the low snr region; however, in delay-tolerant transmission mode, the system energy efficiency of hd noma exceeds fd noma in the high snr region."
"on optimal power allocation for downlink non-orthogonal multiple access systems. non-orthogonal multiple access (noma) enables power-domain multiplexing via successive interference cancellation (sic) and has been viewed as a promising technology for 5g communication. the full benefit of noma depends on resource allocation, including power allocation and channel assignment, for all users, which, however, leads to mixed integer programs. in the literature, the optimal power allocation has only been found in some special cases, while the joint optimization of power allocation and channel assignment generally requires exhaustive search. in this paper, we investigate resource allocation in downlink noma systems. as the main contribution, we analytically characterize the optimal power allocation with given channel assignment over multiple channels under different performance criteria. specifically, we consider the maximin fairness, weighted sum rate maximization, sum rate maximization with quality of service (qos) constraints, energy efficiency maximization with weights or qos constraints in noma systems. we also take explicitly into account the order constraints on the powers of the users on each channel, which are often ignored in theexisting works, and show that they have a significant impact on sic in noma systems. then, we provide the optimal power allocation for the considered criteria in closed or semi-closed form. we also propose a low-complexity efficient method to jointly optimize channel assignment and power allocation in noma systems by incorporating the matching algorithm with the optimal power allocation. simulation results show that the joint resource optimization using our optimal power allocation yields better performance than the existing schemes."
"on the secrecy rate of downlink noma in underlay spectrum sharing with imperfect csi. in this paper, we present the ergodic sum secrecy rate (essr) analysis of an underlay spectrum sharing non-orthogonal multiple access (noma) system. we consider the scenario where the power transmitted by the secondary transmitter (st) is constrained by the peak tolerable interference at multiple primary receivers (prs) as well as the maximum transmit power of the st. the effect of channel estimation error is also taken into account in our analysis. we derive exact and asymptotic closed-form expressions for the essr of the downlink noma system, and show that the performance can be classified into two distinct regimes, i.e., it is dictated either by the interference constraint or by the power constraint. our results confirm the superiority of the noma-based system over its orthogonal multiple access (oma) based counterpart. more interestingly, our results show that noma helps in maintaining the secrecy rate of the strong user while significantly enhancing the secrecy performance of the weak user as compared to oma. the correctness of the proposed investigation is corroborated through monte carlo simulation."
