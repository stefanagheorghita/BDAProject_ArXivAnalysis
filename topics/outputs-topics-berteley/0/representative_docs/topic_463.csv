direct extraction of nuclear effects in quasielastic scattering on carbon. nuclear effects on neutrino reactions are expected to be a significant complication in current and future neutrino oscillation experiments seeking precision measurements of neutrino flavor transitions. calculations of these nuclear effects are hampered by a lack of experimental data comparing neutrino reactions on free nucleons to neutrino reactions on nuclei. we present results from a novel technique that compares neutrino and antineutrino charged current quasielastic scattering on hydrocarbons to extract a cross section ratio of antineutrino charged current elastic reactions on free protons to charged current quasielastic reactions on the protons bound in a carbon nucleus. this measurement of nuclear effects is compared to models.
"electron neutrino charged-current quasielastic scattering in the minerva experiment. the electron-neutrino charged-current quasielastic (ccqe) cross section on nuclei is an important input parameter for electron neutrino appearance oscillation experiments. current experiments typically begin with the muon neutrino cross section and apply theoretical corrections to obtain a prediction for the electron neutrino cross section. however, at present no experimental verification of the estimates for this channel at an energy scale appropriate to such experiments exists. we present the cross sections for a ccqe-like process determined using the minerva detector, which are the first measurements of any exclusive reaction in few-gev electron neutrino interactions. the result is given as differential cross-sections vs. the electron energy, electron angle, and square of the four-momentum transferred to the nucleus, $q^{2}$. we also compute the ratio to a muon neutrino cross-section in $q^{2}$ from minerva. we find satisfactory agreement between these measurements and the predictions of the genie generator. we furthermore report on a photon-like background unpredicted by the generator which we interpret as neutral-coherent diffractive scattering from hydrogen."
"first combined measurement of the muon neutrino and antineutrino charged-current cross section without pions in the final state at t2k. this paper presents the first combined measurement of the double-differential muon neutrino and antineutrino charged-current cross sections with no pions in the final state on hydrocarbon at the off-axis near detector of the t2k experiment. the data analyzed in this work comprise 5.8$\times$10$^{20}$ and 6.3$\times$10$^{20}$ protons on target in neutrino and antineutrino mode respectively, at a beam energy peak of 0.6 gev. using the two measured cross sections, the sum, difference and asymmetry were calculated with the aim of better understanding the nuclear effects involved in such interactions. the extracted measurements have been compared with the prediction from different monte carlo generators and theoretical models showing that the difference between the two cross sections have interesting sensitivity to nuclear effects."
