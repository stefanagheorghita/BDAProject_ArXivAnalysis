"snfinllm: systematic and nuanced financial domain adaptation of chinese large language models. large language models (llms) have become powerful tools for advancing natural language processing applications in the financial industry. however, existing financial llms often face challenges such as hallucinations or superficial parameter training, resulting in suboptimal performance, particularly in financial computing and machine reading comprehension (mrc). to address these issues, we propose a novel large language model specifically designed for the chinese financial domain, named snfinllm. snfinllm excels in domain-specific tasks such as answering questions, summarizing financial research reports, analyzing sentiment, and executing financial calculations. we then perform the supervised fine-tuning (sft) to enhance the model's proficiency across various financial domains. specifically, we gather extensive financial data and create a high-quality instruction dataset composed of news articles, professional papers, and research reports of finance domain. utilizing both domain-specific and general datasets, we proceed with continuous pre-training on an established open-source base model, resulting in snfinllm-base. following this, we engage in supervised fine-tuning (sft) to bolster the model's capability across multiple financial tasks. crucially, we employ a straightforward direct preference optimization (dpo) method to better align the model with human preferences. extensive experiments conducted on finance benchmarks and our evaluation dataset demonstrate that snfinllm markedly outperforms other state-of-the-art financial language models. for more details, check out our demo video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyt-65hzwus."
"an effective data creation pipeline to generate high-quality financial instruction data for large language model. at the beginning era of large language model, it is quite critical to generate a high-quality financial dataset to fine-tune a large language model for financial related tasks. thus, this paper presents a carefully designed data creation pipeline for this purpose. particularly, we initiate a dialogue between an ai investor and financial expert using chatgpt and incorporate the feedback of human financial experts, leading to the refinement of the dataset. this pipeline yielded a robust instruction tuning dataset comprised of 103k multi-turn chats. extensive experiments have been conducted on this dataset to evaluate the model's performance by adopting an external gpt-4 as the judge. the promising experimental results verify that our approach led to significant advancements in generating accurate, relevant, and financial-style responses from ai models, and thus providing a powerful tool for applications within the financial sector."
"fins-pilot: a benchmark for online financial rag system. large language models (llms) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various professional domains, with their performance typically evaluated through standardized benchmarks. in the financial field, the stringent demands for professional accuracy and real-time data processing often necessitate the use of retrieval-augmented generation (rag) techniques. however, the development of financial rag benchmarks has been constrained by data confidentiality issues and the lack of dynamic data integration. to address this issue, we introduce fins-pilot, a novel benchmark for evaluating rag systems in online financial applications. constructed from real-world financial assistant interactions, our benchmark incorporates both real-time api data and text data, organized through an intent classification framework covering critical financial domains. the benchmark enables comprehensive evaluation of financial assistants' capabilities in handling both static knowledge and time-sensitive market information.through systematic experiments with multiple chinese leading llms, we demonstrate fins-pilot's effectiveness in identifying models suitable for financial applications while addressing the current gap in specialized evaluation tools for the financial domain. our work contributes both a practical evaluation framework and a curated dataset to advance research in financial nlp systems. the code and dataset are accessible on github."
