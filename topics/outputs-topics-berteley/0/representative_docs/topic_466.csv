"na-o anticorrelation and hb. ii. the na-o anticorrelation in the globular cluster ngc 6752. we are studying the na-o anticorrelation in several globular clusters of different horizontal branch (hb) morphology in order to derive a possible relation between (primordial) chemical inhomogeneities and morphological parameters of the cluster population. we used the multifiber spectrograph flames on the eso very large telescope ut2 and derived atmospheric parameters and elemental abundances of fe, o and na for about 150 red giant stars in the galactic globular cluster ngc 6752. the average metallicity we derive is [fe/h]=-1.56, in agreement with other results from red giants, but lower than obtained for dwarfs or early subgiants. in ngc 6752 there is not much space for an intrinsic spread in metallicity: on average, the rms scatter in [fe/h] is 0.037+/-0.003 dex, while the scatter expected on the basis of the major error sources is 0.039+/-0.003 dex. the distribution of stars along the na-o anticorrelation is different to what was found in the first paper of this series for the globular cluster ngc 2808: in ngc 6752 it is skewed toward more na-poor stars, and it resembles more the one in m 13. detailed modeling is required to clarify whether this difference may explain the very different distributions of stars along the hb."
"na-o anticorrelation and hb. vi. the chemical composition of the peculiar bulge globular cluster ngc 6388. we present the lte abundance analysis of high resolution spectra for red giant stars in the peculiar bulge globular cluster ngc 6388. spectra of seven members were taken using the uves spectrograph at the eso vlt2 and the multiobject flames facility. we exclude any intrinsic metallicity spread in this cluster: on average, [fe/h]=-0.44+/-0.01+/-0.03 dex on the scale of the present series of papers, where the first error bar refers to individual star-to-star errors and the second is systematic, relative to the cluster. elements involved in h-burning at high temperatures show large spreads, exceeding the estimated errors in the analysis. in particular, the pairs na and o, al and mg are anticorrelated and na and al are correlated among the giants in ngc 6388, the typical pattern observed in all galactic globular clusters studied so far. stars in ngc 6388 shows an excess of alpha-process elements, similar to the one found in the twin bulge cluster ngc 6441. mn is found underabundant in ngc 6388, in agreement with the average abundance ratio shown by clusters of any metallicity. abundances of neutron-capture elements are homogeneously distributed within ngc 6388; the [eu/fe] ratio stands above the value found in field stars of similar metallicity."
"excess of ca (and sc) produced in globular cluster multiple populations: a first census in 77 galactic globular clusters. multiple stellar populations in globular clusters (gcs) are distinct by their different abundances of light elements. the abundance anti-correlations point towards a nucleosynthesis origin due to high-temperature h burning, but it remains to be assessed which type of stars altered primordial abundances in gcs. in particular, the regime at very high temperature that shapes the variations in potassium as well as calcium and scandium, which has been detected in a few notable cases such as ngc 2419 and ngc 2808, is still poorly explored. we started a systematic search for excess of ca (and sc) in gc stars with respect to the level of unmodified field stars. statistically robust evidence of such excess was found in a small number of gcs (ngc 4833, ngc 6715, ngc 6402, ngc 5296, ngc 5824, and ngc 5139/omega centauri) that join the previously known two clusters. for the first time we show that ngc 4833 is likely to host anti-correlated k and mg abundances. all these gcs are among the most massive ones in the galaxy. we found that the fraction of stars with ca enhancement at 3sigma above the field star distribution is a multivariate function of the gc mass and metallicity, as in other manifestations of the multiple population phenomenon in gcs. we argue that these alterations in only a few gcs can be reproduced by two different channels: either a class of ordinary stars, that is common to all gcs, acts only in particular environments, or an on-off mechanism is generated by the occurrence of a peculiar type of stars (or lack of such stars). hot bottom burning in asymptotic giant branch stars in the low-metallicity regime is a good candidate for the first class. alternatively, a metallicity dependence is also expected for supermassive stars, which are predicted to preferentially form in massive gcs.
