"affine fractional $l^p$ sobolev inequalities. sharp affine fractional $l^p$ sobolev inequalities for functions on $\mathbb r^n$ are established. the new inequalities are stronger than (and directly imply) the sharp fractional $l^p$ sobolev inequalities. they are fractional versions of the affine $l^p$ sobolev inequalities of lutwak, yang, and zhang. in addition, affine fractional asymmetric $l^p$ sobolev inequalities are established."
in between the inequalities of sobolev and hardy. we establish both sufficient and necessary conditions for the validity of the so-called hardy-sobolev inequalities on open sets of the euclidean space. these inequalities form a natural interpolating scale between the (weighted) sobolev inequalities and the (weighted) hardy inequalities. the assouad dimension of the complement of the open set turns out to play an important role in both sufficient and necessary conditions.
a weighted anisotropic sobolev type inequality and its applications to hardy inequalities. in this paper we focus our attention on an embedding result for a weighted sobolev space that involves as weight the distance function from the boundary taken with respect to a general smooth gauge function $f$. starting from this type of inequalities we prove some refined hardy-type inequalities.
