"the single top quark physics. the single top quark production has an electroweak nature and provides an additional to the top pair production source of the top quarks. the processes involving single top have unique properties, they are very interesting from both theoretical and experimental view points. short review of the single top quark production processes is given in the paper."
"top physics at the lhc. we review the present situation in top quark physics, in these early days of run ii of the lhc. we take mostly a standard model perspective, showing recent results, and review the key concepts and results of the associated theoretical predictions. the issues we discuss are the top quark mass, top quark pair and single top production, production in association with other particles, charge asymmetry and top quark decay."
"recent results on top quark physics with the atlas and cms experiments. an overview of the most recent results on top quark physics obtained using proton-proton collision data collected with the atlas and the cms experiments at 7 tev center-of-mass energy is given. measurements for inclusive and differential top quark pair or single top quark production in different final states are reviewed. top properties such as w helicity in top decays, electric charge, charge asymmetry and spin correlations of top quark pairs, among others have also been measured by the lhc experiments. all the measurements are found to be consistent with the standard model predictions with a good level of accuracy. the latest results in the measurement of the top quark mass at the lhc are also presented and discussed."
