"quantitative x-ray spectroscopy of massive stars. radiative transfer in a clumped winds is used to describe x-ray emission line profiles observed in the xmm-newton rgs spectrum of the oi star zeta puppis. it is shown that this x-ray spectrum can be explained as originating from a multi-temperature collisional plasma located in the wind acceleration zone. the x-rays are attenuated in the clumped stellar wind, which gives characteristic profiles to the emergent lines. we specifically study the n vii emission line in the spectrum of zeta pup. long rgs exposures reveal that the n vii line profile is structured. on the basis of our zeta pup atmosphere model, we rule out the presence of n vii in the cool wind component. we suggest that the detailed n vii line structure is due to self-absorption in the hot plasma. wind clumping also affects the transfer of ionizing radiation in high-mass x-ray binaries (hmxbs). we derive analytical formulae for the ionisation parameter in dependence on the parameters of wind clumping."
"the 2.35 year itch of cyg ob2 #9 - i. optical and x-ray monitoring. context: nonthermal radio emission in massive stars is expected to arise in wind-wind collisions occurring inside a binary system. one such case, the o-type star cyg ob2 #9, was proven to be a binary only four years ago, but the orbital parameters remained uncertain. the periastron passage of 2011 was the first one to be observable under good conditions since the discovery of binarity. aims: in this context, we have organized a large monitoring campaign to refine the orbital solution and to study the wind-wind collision. methods: this paper presents the analysis of optical spectroscopic data, as well as of a dedicated x-ray monitoring performed with swift and xmm. results: in light of our refined orbital solution, cyg ob2 #9 appears as a massive o+o binary with a long period and high eccentricity; its components (o5-5.5i for the primary and o3-4iii for the secondary) have similar masses and similar luminosities. the new data also provide the first evidence that a wind-wind collision is present in the system. in the optical domain, the broad ha line varies, displaying enhanced absorption and emission components at periastron. x-ray observations yield the unambiguous signature of an adiabatic collision because, as the stars approach periastron, the x-ray luminosity closely follows the 1/d variation expected in that case. the x-ray spectrum appears, however, slightly softer at periastron, which is probably related to winds colliding at slightly lower speeds at that time. conclusions: it is the first time that such a variation has been detected in o+o systems, and the first case where the wind-wind collision is found to remain adiabatic even at periastron passage."
"chandra x-ray spectroscopy of the very early o supergiant hd 93129a: constraints on wind shocks and the mass-loss rate. we present analysis of both the resolved x-ray emission line profiles and the broadband x-ray spectrum of the o2 if* star hd 93129a, measured with the chandra hetgs. this star is among the earliest and most massive stars in the galaxy, and provides a test of the embedded wind shock scenario in a very dense and powerful wind. a major new result is that continuum absorption by the dense wind is the primary cause of the hardness of the observed x-ray spectrum, while intrinsically hard emission from colliding wind shocks contributes less than 10% of the x-ray flux. we find results consistent with the predictions of numerical simulations of the line-driving instability, including line broadening indicating an onset radius of x-ray emission of several tenths rstar. helium-like forbidden-to-intercombination line ratios are consistent with this onset radius, and inconsistent with being formed in a wind-collision interface with the star's closest visual companion at a distance of ~100 au. the broadband x-ray spectrum is fit with a dominant emission temperature of just kt = 0.6 kev along with significant wind absorption. the broadband wind absorption and the line profiles provide two independent measurements of the wind mass-loss rate: mdot = 5.2_{-1.5}^{+1.8} \times 10^{-6} msun/yr and mdot = 6.8_{-2.2}^{+2.8} \times 10^{-6} msun/yr, respectively. this is the first consistent modeling of the x-ray line profile shapes and broadband x-ray spectral energy distribution in a massive star, and represents a reduction of a factor of 3 to 4 compared to the standard h-alpha mass-loss rate that assumes a smooth wind."
