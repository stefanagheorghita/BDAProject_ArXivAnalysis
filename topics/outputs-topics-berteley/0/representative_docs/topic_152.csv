nondipole photoelectron momentum shifts in strong-field ionization with mid-infrared laser pulses of long duration. we consider atomic strong-field ionization in the long-pulse limit for linearly polarized infrared laser fields. we show how nondipole effects in the plane formed by the propagation and polarization directions lead to (i) a shift of the origin of the rings describing the energetically allowed final electron momenta for individual above-threshold ionization channels and (ii) a redistribution in the continuum population on each ring.
momentum-resolved study of the saturation intensity in multiple ionization. we present a momentum-resolved study of strong field multiple ionization of ionic targets. using a deconvolution method we are able to reconstruct the electron momenta from the ion momentum distributions after multiple ionization up to four sequential ionization steps. this technique allows an accurate determination of the saturation intensity as well as of the electron release times during the laser pulse. the measured results are discussed in comparison to typically used models of over-the-barrier ionization and tunnel ionization.
"strong-field ionization of clusters using two-cycle pulses at 1.8~$\mu$m. the interaction of intense laser pulses with nano-scale particles leads to the production of high-energy electrons, ions, neutral atoms, neutrons and photons. up to now, investigations have focused on near-infrared to x-ray laser pulses consisting of many optical cycles. here we study strong-field ionization of rare-gas clusters ($10^3$ to $10^5$ atoms) using two-cycle 1.8~$\mu$m laser pulses to access a new interaction regime in the limit where the electron dynamics are dominated by the laser field and the cluster atoms do not have time to move significantly. the emission of fast electrons with kinetic energies exceeding 3kev is observed using laser pulses with a wavelength of 1.8~$\mu$m and an intensity of $1\times 10^{15}$~w/cm$^2$, whereas only electrons below 500ev are observed at 800nm using a similar intensity and pulse duration. fast electrons are preferentially emitted along the laser polarization direction, showing that they are driven out from the cluster by the laser field. in addition to direct electron emission, an electron rescattering plateau is observed. scaling to even longer wavelengths is expected to result in a highly directional current of energetic electrons on a few-femtosecond timescale."
