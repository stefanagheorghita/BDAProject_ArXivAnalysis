"expected value of letters of permutations with a given number of $k$-cycles. in this paper, we study permutations $\pi \in s_n$ with exactly $m$ transpositions. in particular, we are interested in the expected value of $\pi(1)$ when such permutations are chosen uniformly at random. when $n$ is even, this expected value is approximated closely by $(n+1)/2$, with an error term that is related to the number isometries of the $(n/2-m)$-dimensional hypercube that move every face. furthermore, when $k \mid n$, this construction generalizes to allow us to compute the expected value of $\pi(1)$ for permutations with exactly $m$ $k$-cycles. in this case, the expected value has an error term which is related instead to the number derangements of the generalized symmetric group $s(k,n/k-m)$. when $k$ does not divide $n$, the expected value of $\pi(1)$ is precisely $(n+1)/2$. indirectly, this suggests the existence of a reversible algorithm to insert a letter into a permutation which preserves the number of $k$-cycles, which we construct."
"a generalization of the simion-schmidt bijection for restricted permutations. we consider the two permutation statistics which count the distinct pairs obtained from the last two terms of occurrences of patterns t_1...t_{m-2}m(m-1) and t_1...t_{m-2}(m-1)m in a permutation, respectively. by a simple involution in terms of permutation diagrams we will prove their equidistribution over the symmetric group. as special case we derive a one-to-one correspondence between permutations which avoid each of the patterns t_1...t_{m-2}m(m-1) in s_m and such ones which avoid each of the patterns t_1...t_{m-2}(m-1)m. for m=3, this correspondence coincides with the bijection given by simion and schmidt in their famous paper on restricted permutations."
"restricted permutations refined by number of crossings and nestings. let $st=\{st_1,\ldots,st_k\}$ be a set of $k$ statistics on permutations with $k\geq 1$. we say that two given subset of permutations $t$ and $t'$ are $st$-wilf-equivalent if the joint distributions of all statistics in $st$ over the sets of $t$-avoiding permutations $s_n(t)$ and $t'$-avoiding permutations $s_n(t')$ are the same. the main purpose of this paper is the (cr,nes)-wilf-equivalence classes for all single patterns in $s_3$, where cr and nes denote respectively the statistics number of crossings and nestings. one of the main tools that we use is the bijection $\theta:s_n(321)\rightarrow s_n(132)$ which was originally exhibited by elizalde and pak in \cite{elizp}. they proved that the bijection $\theta$ preserves the number of fixed points and excedances. since the given formulation of $\theta$ is not direct, we show that it can be defined directly by a recursive formula. then, we prove that it also preserves the number of crossings. due to the fact that the sets of non-nesting permutations and 321-avoiding permutations are the same, these properties of the bijection $\theta$ leads to an unexpected result related to the q,p-catalan numbers of randrianarivony defined in \cite{arandr}."
