history dependence of mechanical properties in granular systems. we study the history dependence of the mechanical properties of granular media by numerical simulations. we perform a compaction of frictional disk packings in a two-dimensional system by controlling the area of the domain with various strain rates. we then find the strain rate dependence of the critical packing fraction above which the pressure becomes finite. the observed behavior makes a contrast with the well-studied jamming transitions for frictionless disk packings. we also observe that the elastic constants of the disk packings depend on the strain rate logarithmically. this result provides a experimental test for the history dependence of granular systems.
"geometry-dependent constitutive law for granular slow frictional drag. frictional constitutive law for very slow vertical withdrawing of a thin rod from a granular bed is experimentally studied. using a very precise creep meter, geometry-dependent granular frictional constitutive law is particularly examined. in some previous works, a dimensionless number $i=\dot{\gamma}d_g/\sqrt{p/\rho_g}$ has been used to characterize granular frictional constitutive laws, where $\dot{\gamma}$, $d_g$, $p$, and $\rho_g$ are the shear strain rate, grain diameter, confining pressure, and bulk density of granular bed, respectively. it has been considered that granular frictional constitutive law expressed by $i$ is universal (almost geometry-independent) in dense flow regime. in this study, however, we find that the geometry of the system is much more crucial to characterize granular friction in a very slow withdrawing regime. specifically, the ratio between rod and grain diameters must be an essential parameter to describe the granular frictional constitutive law. physical meaning of the geometry-dependent constitutive law is discussed on the basis of grains-contact-number dependence of granular behavior."
"continuum theory of partially fluidized granular flows. a continuum theory of partially fluidized granular flows is developed. the theory is based on a combination of the equations for the flow velocity and shear stresses coupled with the order parameter equation which describes the transition between flowing and static components of the granular system. we apply this theory to several important granular problems: avalanche flow in deep and shallow inclined layers, rotating drums and shear granular flows between two plates. we carry out quantitative comparisons between the theory and experiment."
