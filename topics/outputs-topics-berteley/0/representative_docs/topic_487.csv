"real-time second-order optimal guidance strategies for optimizing aircraft performance in stochastic wind conditions. this study presents a real-time guidance strategy for an unmanned aerial vehicles (uavs) that can be used to enhance their flight endurance by utilizing {\sl insitu} measurements of wind speeds and wind gradients. in these strategies, periodic adjustments are made in the airspeed and/or heading angle command, in level flights, for the uav to minimize a projected power requirement. in this study, uav dynamics are described by a three-dimensional dynamic point-mass model. a stochastic wind field model has been used to analyze the effect of the wind in the process. onboard closed-loop trajectory tracking logics that follow airspeed vector commands are modeled using the method of feedback linearization. to evaluate the benefits of these strategies in enhancing uav flight endurance, a reference strategy is introduced in which the uav would follow the optimal airspeed command in a steady level flight under zero wind conditions. a performance measure is defined as the average power consumption with respect to no wind case. different scenarios have been evaluated both over a specified time interval and over different initial heading angles of the uav. a relative benefit criterion is then defined as the percentage improvement in the performance measure of a proposed strategy over that of the reference strategy. extensive numerical simulations are conducted to show efficiency and applicability of the proposed algorithms. results demonstrate possible power savings of the proposed real-time guidance strategies in level flights, by utilization of wind energy."
"real-time first order guidance strategies for trajectory optimization in uavs by utilizing wind energy. this paper presents real-time guidance strategies for unmanned aerial vehicles (uavs) that can be used to enhance their flight endurance by utilizing {\sl insitu} measurements of wind speeds and wind gradients. in these strategies, periodic adjustments would be made in the airspeed and/or heading angle command for the uav to minimize a projected power requirement at some future time. in this paper, uav flights are described by a three-dimensional dynamic point-mass. onboard closed-loop trajectory tracking logics that follow airspeed vector commands are modeled using the method of feedback linearization. a generic wind field model is assumed that consists of a constant term plus terms that vary sinusoidally with respect to the location. to evaluate the benefits of these strategies in enhancing uav flight endurance, a reference strategy is introduced in which the uav would seek to follow the desired airspeed in a steady level flight under zero wind. a performance measure is defined as the average power consumption both over a specified time interval and over different initial heading angles of the uav. a relative benefit criterion is then defined as the percentage improvement of the performance measure of a proposed strategy over that of the reference strategy. extensive numerical simulations are conducted. results demonstrate the benefits and trends of power savings of the proposed real-time guidance strategies."
"convex geometric trajectory tracking using lie algebraic mpc for autonomous marine vehicles. controlling marine vehicles in challenging environments is a complex task due to the presence of nonlinear hydrodynamics and uncertain external disturbances. despite nonlinear model predictive control (mpc) showing potential in addressing these issues, its practical implementation is often constrained by computational limitations. in this paper, we propose an efficient controller for trajectory tracking of marine vehicles by employing a convex error-state mpc on the lie group. by leveraging the inherent geometric properties of the lie group, we can construct globally valid error dynamics and formulate a quadratic programming-based optimization problem. our proposed mpc demonstrates effectiveness in trajectory tracking through extensive-numerical simulations, including scenarios involving ocean currents. notably, our method substantially reduces computation time compared to nonlinear mpc, making it well-suited for real-time control applications with long prediction horizons or involving small marine vehicles."
