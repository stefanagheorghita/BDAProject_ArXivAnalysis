"hybridized threshold clustering for massive data. as the size $n$ of datasets become massive, many commonly-used clustering algorithms (for example, $k$-means or hierarchical agglomerative clustering (hac) require prohibitive computational cost and memory. in this paper, we propose a solution to these clustering problems by extending threshold clustering (tc) to problems of instance selection. tc is a recently developed clustering algorithm designed to partition data into many small clusters in linearithmic time (on average). our proposed clustering method is as follows. first, tc is performed and clusters are reduced into single ""prototype"" points. then, tc is applied repeatedly on these prototype points until sufficient data reduction has been obtained. finally, a more sophisticated clustering algorithm is applied to the reduced prototype points, thereby obtaining a clustering on all $n$ data points. this entire procedure for clustering is called iterative hybridized threshold clustering (ihtc). through simulation results and by applying our methodology on several real datasets, we show that ihtc combined with $k$-means or hac substantially reduces the run time and memory usage of the original clustering algorithms while still preserving their performance. additionally, ihtc helps prevent singular data points from being overfit by clustering algorithms."
"convex clustering through mm: an efficient algorithm to perform hierarchical clustering. convex clustering is a modern method with both hierarchical and $k$-means clustering characteristics. although convex clustering can capture complex clustering structures hidden in data, the existing convex clustering algorithms are not scalable to large data sets with sample sizes greater than several thousands. moreover, it is known that convex clustering sometimes fails to produce a complete hierarchical clustering structure. this issue arises if clusters split up or the minimum number of possible clusters is larger than the desired number of clusters. in this paper, we propose convex clustering through majorization-minimization (ccmm) -- an iterative algorithm that uses cluster fusions and a highly efficient updating scheme derived using diagonal majorization. additionally, we explore different strategies to ensure that the hierarchical clustering structure terminates in a single cluster. with a current desktop computer, ccmm efficiently solves convex clustering problems featuring over one million objects in seven-dimensional space, achieving a solution time of 51 seconds on average."
"statistical properties of convex clustering. in this manuscript, we study the statistical properties of convex clustering. we establish that convex clustering is closely related to single linkage hierarchical clustering and $k$-means clustering. in addition, we derive the range of tuning parameter for convex clustering that yields a non-trivial solution. we also provide an unbiased estimate of the degrees of freedom, and provide a finite sample bound for the prediction error for convex clustering. we compare convex clustering to some traditional clustering methods in simulation studies."
