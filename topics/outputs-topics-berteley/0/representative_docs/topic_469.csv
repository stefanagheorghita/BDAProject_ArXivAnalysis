"cu nuclear magnetic resonance study of charge and spin stripe order in la$_{1.875}$ba$_{0.125}$cuo$_4$. we present a cu nuclear magnetic/quadrupole resonance study of the charge stripe ordered phase of lbco, with detection of previously unobserved ('wiped-out') signal. we show that spin-spin and spin-lattice relaxation rates are strongly enhanced in the charge ordered phase, explaining the apparent signal decrease in earlier investigations. the enhancement is caused by magnetic, rather than charge fluctuations, conclusively confirming the long-suspected assumption that spin fluctuations are responsible for the wipeout effect. observation of the full cu signal enables insight into the spin and charge dynamics of the stripe-ordered phase, and measurements in external magnetic fields provide information on the nature and suppression of spin fluctuations associated with charge order. we find glassy spin dynamics, in agreement with previous work, and incommensurate static charge order with charge modulation amplitude similar to other cuprate compounds, suggesting that the amplitude of charge stripes is universal in the cuprates."
"separate tuning of nematicity and spin fluctuations to unravel the origin of superconductivity in fese. the interplay of orbital and spin degrees of freedom is the fundamental characteristic in numerous condensed matter phenomena, including high temperature superconductivity, quantum spin liquids, and topological semimetals. in iron-based superconductors (fescs), this causes superconductivity to emerge in the vicinity of two other instabilities: nematic and magnetic. unveiling the mutual relationship among nematic order, spin fluctuations, and superconductivity has been a major challenge for research in fescs, but it is still controversial. here, by carrying out 77se nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) measurements on fese single crystals, doped by cobalt and sulfur that serve as control parameters, we demonstrate that the superconducting transition temperature tc increases in proportion to the strength of spin fluctuations, while it is independent of the nematic transition temperature tnem. our observation therefore directly implies that superconductivity in fese is essentially driven by spin fluctuations in the intermediate coupling regime, while nematic fluctuations have a marginal impact on tc."
"the nematic energy scale and the missing electron pocket in fese. superconductivity emerges in proximity to a nematic phase in most iron-based superconductors. it is therefore important to understand the impact of nematicity on the electronic structure. orbital assignment and tracking across the nematic phase transition prove to be challenging due to the multiband nature of iron-based superconductors and twinning effects. here, we report a detailed study of the electronic structure of fully detwinned fese across the nematic phase transition using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. we clearly observe a nematicity-driven band reconstruction involving dxz, dyz, and dxy orbitals. the nematic energy scale between dxz and dyz bands reaches a maximum of 50 mev at the brillouin zone corner. we are also able to track the dxz electron pocket across the nematic transition and explain its absence in the nematic state. our comprehensive data of the electronic structure provide an accurate basis for theoretical models of the superconducting pairing in fese."
