detection of supernova neutrinos. the neutrino burst from a core-collapse supernova can provide information about the star explosion mechanism and the mechanisms of proto neutron star cooling but also about the intrinsic properties of the neutrino such as flavor oscillations. one important question is to understand to which extent can the supernova and the neutrino physics be decoupled in the observation of a single supernova. the capabilities of present and future large underground neutrino detectors to yield information about the time and flavor dependent neutrino signal from a future galactic supernova are described in this paper. neutrinos from past cosmic supernovae are also observable and their detection will improve our knowledge of the core-collapse rates and average neutrino emission. a comparison between the different experimental techniques is included.
"neutrinos from a core collapse supernova. the neutrino burst from a galactic supernova can help determine the neutrino mass hierarchy and $\theta_{13}$, and provide crucial information about supernova astrophysics. here we review our current understanding of the neutrino burst, flavor conversions of these neutrinos, and model independent signatures of various neutrino mixing scenarios."
"decoupling supernova and neutrino oscillation physics with lar tpc detectors. core collapse supernovae are a huge source of all flavor neutrinos. the flavor composition, energy spectrum and time structure of the neutrino burst from a galactic supernova can provide information about the explosion mechanism and the mechanisms of proto neutron star cooling. such data can also give information about the intrinsic properties of the neutrino such as flavor oscillations. one important question is to understand to which extend can the supernova and the neutrino physics be decoupled in the observation of a single supernova. in this paper we discuss the possibility to probe the neutrino mixing angle \th13 and the type of mass hierarchy from the detection of supernova neutrinos with a liquid argon tpc detector. moreover, describing the supernova neutrino emission by a set of five parameters (average energy of the different neutrino flavors, their relative luminosity and the total supernova binding energy), we quantitatively study how it is possible to constrain these parameters. a characteristic feature of the liquid argon tpc is the accessibility to four independent detection channels ((1) elastic scattering off electrons, (2) charged neutrino and (3) antineutrino and (4) neutral currents on argon nuclei) which have different sensitivities to electron-neutrino, anti-electron-neutrino and other neutrino flavors (muon and tau (anti)neutrinos). this allows to over-constrain the five supernova and the flavor mixing parameters and to some extent disentangle neutrino from supernova physics."
