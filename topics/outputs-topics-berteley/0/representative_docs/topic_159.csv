"nonlocal optical response of particle plasmons in single gold nanorods. particle plasmons in metal nanoparticles have primarily been investigated through the use of local optical response approximations. however, as nanoparticle size approaches the average distance of electrons to the metal surface, mesoscopic effects such as size-dependent plasmon linewidth broadening and resonance energy blue shifts are expected to become observable. in this work, we compared the experimental spectral characteristics with simulated values obtained using a generalized nonlocal optical response theory-based local analogue model. our results show that the nonlocal plasmon damping effects in single nanoparticles are less significant compared to those observed in plasmon-coupled systems. moreover, our study demonstrates that single-particle dark-field spectroscopy is an effective tool for investigating the nonlocal optical response of particle plasmons in single nanoparticles. these results have important implications for the rational design of novel nanophotonic devices."
"quantum theory of plasmon polaritons in chains of metallic nanoparticles: from near- to far-field coupling regime. we develop a quantum theory of plasmon polaritons in chains of metallic nanoparticles, describing both near- and far-field interparticle distances, by including plasmon-photon umklapp processes. taking into account the retardation effects of the long-range dipole-dipole interaction between the nanoparticles, which are induced by the coupling of the plasmonic degrees of freedom to the photonic continuum, we reveal the polaritonic nature of the normal modes of the system. we compute the dispersion relation and radiative linewidth, as well as the group velocities of the eigenmodes, and compare our numerical results to classical electrodynamic calculations within the point-dipole approximation. interestingly, the group velocities of the polaritonic excitations present an almost periodic sign change and are found to be highly tunable by modifying the spacing between the nanoparticles. we show that, away from the intersection of the plasmonic eigenfrequencies with the free photon dispersion, an analytical perturbative treatment of the light-matter interaction is in excellent agreement with our fully retarded numerical calculations. we further study quantitatively the hybridization of light and matter excitations, through an analysis of hopfield's coefficients. finally, we consider the limit of infinitely spaced nanoparticles and discuss some recent results on single nanoparticles that can be found in the literature."
"substrate influence on the plasmonic response of clusters of spherical nanoparticles. the plasmonic response of nanoparticles is exploited in many subfields of science and engineering to enhance optical signals associated with probes of nanoscale and subnanoscale entities. we develop a numerical algorithm based on previous theoretical work that addresses the influence of a substrate on the plasmonic response of collections of nanoparticles of spherical shape. our method is a real space approach within the quasi-static limit that can be applied to a wide range of structures. we illustrate the role of the substrate through numerical calculations that explore single nanospheres and nanosphere dimers fabricated from either a drude model metal or from silver on dielectric substrates, and from dielectric spheres on silver substrates."
