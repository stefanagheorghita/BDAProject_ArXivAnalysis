"low-rank and sparse enhanced tucker decomposition for tensor completion. tensor completion refers to the task of estimating the missing data from an incomplete measurement or observation, which is a core problem frequently arising from the areas of big data analysis, computer vision, and network engineering. due to the multidimensional nature of high-order tensors, the matrix approaches, e.g., matrix factorization and direct matricization of tensors, are often not ideal for tensor completion and recovery. in this paper, we introduce a unified low-rank and sparse enhanced tucker decomposition model for tensor completion. our model possesses a sparse regularization term to promote a sparse core tensor of the tucker decomposition, which is beneficial for tensor data compression. moreover, we enforce low-rank regularization terms on factor matrices of the tucker decomposition for inducing the low-rankness of the tensor with a cheap computational cost. numerically, we propose a customized admm with enough easy subproblems to solve the underlying model. it is remarkable that our model is able to deal with different types of real-world data sets, since it exploits the potential periodicity and inherent correlation properties appeared in tensors. a series of computational experiments on real-world data sets, including internet traffic data sets, color images, and face recognition, demonstrate that our model performs better than many existing state-of-the-art matricization and tensorization approaches in terms of achieving higher recovery accuracy."
"efficient tensor completion: low-rank tensor train. this paper proposes a novel formulation of the tensor completion problem to impute missing entries of data represented by tensors. the formulation is introduced in terms of tensor train (tt) rank which can effectively capture global information of tensors thanks to its construction by a well-balanced matricization scheme. two algorithms are proposed to solve the corresponding tensor completion problem. the first one called simple low-rank tensor completion via tensor train (silrtc-tt) is intimately related to minimizing the tt nuclear norm. the second one is based on a multilinear matrix factorization model to approximate the tt rank of the tensor and called tensor completion by parallel matrix factorization via tensor train (tmac-tt). these algorithms are applied to complete both synthetic and real world data tensors. simulation results of synthetic data show that the proposed algorithms are efficient in estimating missing entries for tensors with either low tucker rank or tt rank while tucker-based algorithms are only comparable in the case of low tucker rank tensors. when applied to recover color images represented by ninth-order tensors augmented from third-order ones, the proposed algorithms outperforms the tucker-based algorithms."
"on tensor completion via nuclear norm minimization. many problems can be formulated as recovering a low-rank tensor. although an increasingly common task, tensor recovery remains a challenging problem because of the delicacy associated with the decomposition of higher order tensors. to overcome these difficulties, existing approaches often proceed by unfolding tensors into matrices and then apply techniques for matrix completion. we show here that such matricization fails to exploit the tensor structure and may lead to suboptimal procedure. more specifically, we investigate a convex optimization approach to tensor completion by directly minimizing a tensor nuclear norm and prove that this leads to an improved sample size requirement. to establish our results, we develop a series of algebraic and probabilistic techniques such as characterization of subdifferetial for tensor nuclear norm and concentration inequalities for tensor martingales, which may be of independent interests and could be useful in other tensor related problems."
