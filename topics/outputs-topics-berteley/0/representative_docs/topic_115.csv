"radiation hard dmaps pixel sensors in 150nm cmos technology for operation at lhc. monolithic active pixel sensors (maps) have been developed since the late 1990s employing silicon substrate with a thin epitaxial layer in which deposited charge is collected by disordered diffusion rather than by drift in an electric field. as a consequence the signal is small and slow, and the radiation tolerance is below the requirements for lhc experiments by factors of 100 to 1000. we developed fully depleted (d)maps pixel sensors employing a 150 nm cmos technology and using a high resistivity substrate as well as a high biasing voltage. the development has been carried out in three subsequent iterations, from prototypes to a large pixel matrix comprising a complete readout architecture suitable for lhc operation. full cmos electronics is embedded in large deep n-wells which at the same time serve as collection nodes (large electrode design). the devices have been intensively characterized before and after irradiation employing lab tests as well as particle beams. the devices can cope with particle rates seen by the innermost pixel detectors of the lhc pp-experiments or as seen by the outer pixel layers of the planned hl-lhc upgrade. they are radiation hard to particle fluences of at least $10^{15}~\mathrm{n_{eq}/cm^2}$ and total ionization doses of at least 50 mrad."
"the star maps-based pixel detector. the pixel detector (pxl) for the heavy flavor tracker (hft) of the star experiment at rhic is the first application of the state-of-the-art thin monolithic active pixel sensors (maps) technology in a collider environment. custom built pixel sensors, their readout electronics and the detector mechanical structure are described in detail. selected detector design aspects and production steps are presented. the detector operations during the three years of data taking (2014-2016) and the overall performance exceeding the design specifications are discussed in the conclusive sections of this paper."
"study of the cms phase-1 pixel pilot blade reconstruction. the compact muon solenoid (cms) detector is one of two general-purpose detectors that measure the products of high energy particle interactions in the large hadron collider (lhc) at cern. the silicon pixel detector is the innermost component of the cms tracking system. the detector which was in operation between 2009 and 2016 has now been replaced with an upgraded one in the beginning of 2017. during the previous shutdown period of the lhc, a prototype readout system and a third disk was inserted into the old forward pixel detector with eight prototype blades constructed using the new digital read-out chips. testing the performance of these pilot modules enabled us to gain operational experience with the upgraded detector. in this paper, the reconstruction and analysis of the data taken with the new modules are presented including information on the calibration of the reconstruction software. the hit finding efficiency and track-hit residual distributions are also shown."
