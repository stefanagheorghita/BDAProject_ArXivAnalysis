"wealth distribution: to be or not to be a gamma?. we review some aspects, especially those we can tackle analytically, of a minimal model of closed economy analogous to the kinetic theory model of ideal gases where the agents exchange wealth amongst themselves such that the total wealth is conserved, and each individual agent saves a fraction (0 < lambda < 1) of wealth before transaction. we are interested in the special case where the fraction lambda is constant for all the agents (global saving propensity) in the closed system. we show by moment calculations that the resulting wealth distribution cannot be the gamma distribution that was conjectured in phys. rev. e 70, 016104 (2004). we also derive a form for the distribution at low wealth, which is a new result."
"economic inequality between groups in an a priori stratified society. we present an agent-based model of economic exchange in a society composed of two groups, representing two social groups and with different internal protection rules for the poor agents. the goal is to address the emerging wealth distribution when economic rules are not the same for all individuals. individuals exchange wealth in pairwise interactions with no underlying lattice. the wealth, risk aversion factor, and group of the agents characterize their state. the wealth exchanged between two agents obeys a fair rule: the quantities put at stake by them are the same regardless of who wins. one agent can interact with another agent in the same or the other group, controlled by a rate which is a parameter of the model. inter-group exchanges obey an exclusive protection rule, which can be understood as a public policy to reduce inequality. we show that the most protected group accumulates more wealth, has less inequality, and has higher mobility than the other group. the results of simulations are compared with income distribution in brazil discriminated by race as an example of the application our model."
"the unfair consequences of equal opportunities: comparing exchange models of wealth distribution. simple agent based exchange models are a commonplace in the study of wealth distribution of artificial societies. generally, each agent is characterized by its wealth and by a risk-aversion factor, and random exchanges between agents allow for a redistribution of the wealth. however, the detailed influence of the amount of capital exchanged has not been fully analyzed yet. here we present a comparison of two exchange rules and also a systematic study of the time evolution of the wealth distribution, its functional dependence, the gini coefficient and time correlation functions. in many cases a stable state is attained, but, interesting, some particular cases are found in which a very slow dynamics develops. finally, we observe that the time evolution and the final wealth distribution are strongly dependent on the exchange rules in a nontrivial way."
