"counting commensurability classes of hyperbolic manifolds. gromov and piatetski-shapiro proved existence of finite volume non-arithmetic hyperbolic manifolds of any given dimension. in dimension four and higher, we show that there are about v^v such manifolds of volume at most v, considered up to commensurability. since the number of arithmetic ones tends to be polynomial, almost all hyperbolic manifolds are non-arithmetic in an appropriate sense. our method involves a geometric graph-of-spaces construction that relies on arithmetic properties of certain quadratic forms."
genus 2 closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds of arbitrarily large volume. we describe a class of genus 2 closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds of arbitrarily large volume.
"the homeomorphism problem for hyperbolic manifolds i. we give a bounded runtime solution to the homeomorphism problem for closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds. this is an algorithm which, given two triangulations of hyperbolic 3-manifolds by at most $t$ tetrahedra, decides if they represent the same hyperbolic 3-manifold with runtime bounded by \[ 2^{2^{t^{o(t)}}}.\] we do this by first finding a hyperbolic structure on each manifold given as a geometric triangulation and then comparing the two as geometric manifolds."
