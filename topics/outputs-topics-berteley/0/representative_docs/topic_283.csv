"legal assist ai: leveraging transformer-based model for effective legal assistance. pursuit of accessible legal assistance in india faces a critical gap, as many citizens struggle to leverage their legal rights due to limited awareness and access to relevant legal information. this paper introduces legal assist ai, a transformer-based model designed to bridge this gap by offering effective legal assistance through large language models (llms). the system retrieves relevant legal information from a curated database and generates accurate responses, enabling effective assistance for diverse users, including legal professionals, scholars, and the general public. the model was fine-tuned on extensive datasets from the indian legal domain, including indian constitution, bharatiya nyaya sanhita (bns), bharatiya nagarik suraksha sanhita (bnss) and so forth, providing a robust understanding of the complexities of indian law. by incorporating domain-specific legal datasets, the proposed model demonstrated remarkable efficiency and specialization in legal question-answering. the model was evaluated against state-of-the-art models such as gpt-3.5 turbo and mistral 7b, achieving a 60.08% score on the aibe, outperforming its competitors in legal reasoning and accuracy. unlike other models, legal assist ai avoided common issues such as hallucinations, making it highly reliable for practical legal applications. it showcases the model's applicability in real-world legal scenarios, with future iterations aiming to enhance performance and expand its dataset to cover a broader range of multilingual and case-specific queries as well."
"learning interpretable legal case retrieval via knowledge-guided case reformulation. legal case retrieval for sourcing similar cases is critical in upholding judicial fairness. different from general web search, legal case retrieval involves processing lengthy, complex, and highly specialized legal documents. existing methods in this domain often overlook the incorporation of legal expert knowledge, which is crucial for accurately understanding and modeling legal cases, leading to unsatisfactory retrieval performance. this paper introduces keller, a legal knowledge-guided case reformulation approach based on large language models (llms) for effective and interpretable legal case retrieval. by incorporating professional legal knowledge about crimes and law articles, we enable large language models to accurately reformulate the original legal case into concise sub-facts of crimes, which contain the essential information of the case. extensive experiments on two legal case retrieval benchmarks demonstrate superior retrieval performance and robustness on complex legal case queries of keller over existing methods."
"large language models meet legal artificial intelligence: a survey. large language models (llms) have significantly advanced the development of legal artificial intelligence (legal ai) in recent years, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of legal tasks. to advance research and applications of llm-based approaches in legal domain, this paper provides a comprehensive review of 16 legal llms series and 47 llm-based frameworks for legal tasks, and also gather 15 benchmarks and 29 datasets to evaluate different legal capabilities. additionally, we analyse the challenges and discuss future directions for llm-based approaches in the legal domain. we hope this paper provides a systematic introduction for beginners and encourages future research in this field. resources are available at https://github.com/zhitianhou/llms4legalai."
