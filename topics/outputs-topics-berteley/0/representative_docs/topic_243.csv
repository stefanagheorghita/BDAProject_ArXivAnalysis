"an isolated white dwarf with a 70 second spin period. we report the discovery of an isolated white dwarf with a spin period of 70 s. we obtained high speed photometry of three ultramassive white dwarfs within 100 pc, and discovered significant variability in one. sdss j221141.80+113604.4 is a $1.27~m_{\odot}$ (assuming a co core) magnetic white dwarf that shows 2.9\% brightness variations in the bg40 filter with a $70.32 \pm 0.04$ s period, becoming the fastest spinning isolated white dwarf currently known. a detailed model atmosphere analysis shows that it has a mixed hydrogen and helium atmosphere with a dipole field strength of $b_d = 15$ mg. given its large mass, fast rotation, strong magnetic field, unusual atmospheric composition, and relatively large tangential velocity for its cooling age, j2211+1136 displays all of the signatures of a double white dwarf merger remnant. long term monitoring of the spin evolution of j2211+1136 and other fast spinning isolated white dwarfs opens a new discovery space for substellar and planetary mass companions around white dwarfs. in addition, the discovery of such fast rotators outside of the zz ceti instability strip suggests that some should also exist within the strip. hence, some of the mono-periodic variables found within the instability strip may be fast spinning white dwarfs impersonating zz ceti pulsators."
"css100603:112253-111037: a helium-rich dwarf nova with a 65 minute orbital period. we present time-resolved optical spectroscopy of the dwarf nova css100603:112253-111037. its optical spectrum is rich in helium, with broad, double-peaked emission lines produced in an accretion disc. we measure a line flux ratio hei5876/h_alpha = 1.49 +/- 0.04, a much higher ratio than is typically observed in dwarf novae. the orbital period, as derived from the radial velocity of the line wings, is 65.233 +/- 0.015 minutes. in combination with the previously measured superhump period, this implies an extreme mass ratio of m_2/m_1 = 0.017 +/- 0.004. the h_alpha and hei6678 emission lines additionally have a narrow central spike, as is often seen in the spectra of am cvn type stars. comparing its properties with cvs, am cvn systems and hydrogen binaries below the cv period minimum, we argue that css100603:112253-111037 is the first compelling example of an am cvn system forming via the evolved cv channel. with the addition of this system, evolved cataclysmic variables (cvs) now account for seven per cent of all known semi-detached white dwarf binaries with porb < 76 min. two recently discovered binaries may further increase this figure. although the selection bias of this sample is not yet well defined, these systems support the evolved cv model as a possible formation channel for ultracompact accreting binaries. the orbital periods of the three ultracompact hydrogen accreting binaries overlap with those of the long period am cvn stars, but there are currently no known systems in the period range 67 - 76 minutes."
"high speed photometry of faint cataclysmic variables - vii. targets selected from the sloan digital sky survey and the catalina real-time transient survey. we present high speed photometric observations of 20 faint cataclysmic variables, selected from the sloan digital sky survey and catalina catalogues. measurements are given of 15 new directly measured orbital periods, including four eclipsing dwarf novae (sdss0904+03, css0826-00, css1404-10 and css1626-12), two new polars (css0810+00 and css1503-22) and two dwarf novae with superhumps in quiescence (css0322+02 and css0826-00). whilst most of the dwarf novae presented here have periods below 2 h, sdss0805+07 and sss0617-36 have relatively long orbital periods of 5.489 and 3.440 h, respectively. the double humped orbital modulations observed in sss0221-26, css0345-01, css1300+11 and css1443-17 are typical of low mass transfer rate dwarf novae. the white dwarf primary of sdss0919+08 is confirmed to have non-radial oscillations and quasi-periodic oscillations were observed in the short-period dwarf nova css1028-08 during outburst. we further report the detection of a new nova-like variable (sdss1519+06). the frequency distribution of orbital periods of cvs in the catalina survey has a high peak near ~80 min orbital period, independently confirming that found by gaensicke et al (2009) from sdss sources. we also observe a marked correlation between the median in the orbital period distribution and the outburst class, in the sense that dwarf novae with a single observed outburst (over the 5-year baseline of the crts coverage) occur predominantly at shortest orbital period."
