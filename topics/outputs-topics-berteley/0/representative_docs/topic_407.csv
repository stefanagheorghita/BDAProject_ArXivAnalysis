"systems of orthogonal polynomials defined by hypergeometric type equations. a hypergeometric type equation satisfying certain conditions defines either a finite or an infinite system of orthogonal polynomials. we present in a unified and explicit way all these systems of orthogonal polynomials, the associated special functions and the corresponding raising/lowering operators. this general formalism allows us to extend some known results to a larger class of functions."
"zeros of orthogonal little q-jacobi polynomials: interlacing and monotonicity. we investigate the distribution of zeros of the little q-jacobi polynomials and related q-hypergeometric families. we prove that the zeros of these orthogonal polynomials exhibit strong interlacing properties and obey natural monotonicity rules with respect to the parameters. a key tool in our approach is the logarithmic mesh, which quantifies the relative spacing of the positive real zeros and allows us to classify families of polynomials with prescribed interlacing patterns. our results include new interlacing relations, monotonicity with respect to parameters, and structural decompositions in non-orthogonal regimes. several classical families of q-hypergeometric polynomials, including q-bessel and stieltjes-wigert polynomials, are treated as limit cases. the methods rely on a combination of classical orthogonality theory and q-difference equations."
"relations for zeros of special polynomials associated to the painleve equations. a method for finding relations for the roots of polynomials is presented. our approach allows us to get a number of relations for the zeros of the classical polynomials and for the roots of special polynomials associated with rational solutions of the painleve equations. we apply the method to obtain the relations for the zeros of several polynomials. they are: the laguerre polynomials, the yablonskii - vorob'ev polynomials, the umemura polynomials, the ohyama polynomials, the generalized okamoto polynomials, and the generalized hermite polynomials. all the relations found can be considered as analogues of generalized stieltjes relations."
