"bound states in bose-einstein condensates with radially-periodic spin-orbit coupling. we consider bose-einstein condensate (bec) subject to the action of spin-orbit-coupling (soc) periodically modulated in the radial direction. in contrast to the commonly known principle that periodic potentials do not create bound states, the binary bec maintains multiple localized modes in the linear limit, with their chemical potential falling into spectral gaps of the (numerically found) radial band structure induced by the spatial modulation of the soc. in the presence of the repulsive nonlinearity, the soc modulation supports fundamental gap solitons of the semi-vortex types, as well as higher-order vortex gap solitons. the localization degree and stability of the gap solitons strongly depend on the location of their chemical potential in the gap. stability intervals for vortex gap solitons in a broad range of the intrinsic vorticity, from -2 to 3, are identified. thus, the analysis reveals the previously unexplored mechanism of linear and nonlinear localization provided by the spatially periodic modulation of soc, which may be extended to other settings, such as those for optical beams and polaritons. unlike the commonly known quartets of eigenvalues for small perturbations, in the present system the instability is accounted for by shifted complex eigenvalue pairs."
"spin solitons in spin-1 bose-einstein condensates. solitons in multi-component bose-einstein condensates have been paid much attention, due to the stability and wide applications of them. the exact soliton solutions are usually obtained for integrable models. in this paper, we present four families of exact spin soliton solutions for non-integrable cases in spin-1 bose-einstein condensates. the whole particle density is uniform for the spin solitons, which is in sharp contrast to the previously reported solitons of integrable models. the spectrum stability analysis and numerical simulation indicate the spin solitons can exist stably. the spin density redistribution happens during the collision process, which depends on the relative phase and relative velocity between spin solitons. the non-integrable properties of the systems can bring spin solitons experience weak amplitude and location oscillations after collision. these stable spin soliton excitations could be used to study the negative inertial mass of solitons, the dynamics of soliton-impurity systems, and the spin dynamics in bose-einstein condensates."
"vortex solitons: old results and new perspectives. a review is given of some well-known and some recent results for two- and three-dimensional (2d and 3d) solitons, with emphasis on states carrying embedded vorticity. unlike typically stable 1d solitons, 2d and 3d ones are vulnerable to instabilities induced by the critical and supercritical collapse, respectively, in the 2d and 3d models with cubic focusing nonlinearity. vortex solitons are subject to a still stronger splitting instability. for this reason, a central problem is looking for physical settings in which 2d and 3d solitons may be stabilized. the review addresses, first, two well-established topics, viz., the stabilization of vortex solitons by means of competing nonlinearities, or by trapping potentials (harmonic-oscillator and spatially-periodic ones). the former topic includes a new addition, viz., the prediction of robust quantum droplets. two other topics outline new schemes elaborated for the creation of stable vortical solitons. one scheme relies on the use of spin-orbit coupling (soc) in binary bec, making it possible to predict stable 2d and 3d solitons, which couple or mix components with vorticities s=0 and (+/-)1 (semi-vortices (svs) or mixed modes (mms), respectively). in this system, the situation is different in the 2d and 3d geometries. in 2d, soc helps to create a ground state (gs), represented by stable sv or mm solitons, whose norm falls below the threshold value at which the critical collapse sets in. in the 3d geometry, the supercritical collapse does not allow one to create a gs, but metastable solitons of the sv and mm types can be constructed. another new scheme makes it possible to create stable 2d vortex-ring solitons with arbitrarily high s in a binary bec with components coupled by microwave radiation. some other topics are addressed too, such as vortex solitons in dissipative media and attempts to create vortex solitons in experiments."
