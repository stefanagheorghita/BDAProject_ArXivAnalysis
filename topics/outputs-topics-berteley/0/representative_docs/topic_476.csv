"flagella-like beating of a single microtubule. kinesin motors can induce a buckling instability in a microtubule with a fixed minus end. here we show that by modifying the surface with a protein-repellent functionalization and using clusters of kinesin motors, the microtubule can exhibit persistent oscillatory motion, resembling the beating of sperm flagella. the observed period is of the order of 1 min. from the experimental images we theoretically determine a distribution of motor forces that explains the observed shapes using a maximum likelihood approach. a good agreement is achieved with a small number of motor clusters acting simultaneously on a microtubule. the tangential forces exerted by a cluster are mostly in the range 0 - 8 pn towards the microtubule minus end, indicating the action of 1 or 2 kinesin motors. the lateral forces are distributed symmetrically and mainly below 10 pn, while the lateral velocity has a strong peak around zero. unlike well-known models for flapping filaments, kinesins are found to have a strong ""pinning"" effect on the beating filaments. our results suggest new strategies to utilize molecular motors in dynamic roles that depend sensitively on the stress built-up in the system."
"tunable dynamics of microtubule based active isotropic gels. we investigate the dynamics of an active gel of bundled microtubules that is driven by clusters of kinesin molecular motors. upon the addition of atp, the coordinated action of thousands of molecular motors drives the gel to a highly dynamical turbulent-like state that persists for hours and is only limited by the stability of constituent proteins and the availability of the chemical fuel. we characterize how enhanced transport and emergent macroscopic flows of active gels depend on relevant molecular parameters, including atp, kinesin motor, and depletant concentrations, microtubule volume fraction, as well as the stoichiometry of the constituent motor clusters. our results show that the dynamical and structural properties of microtubule based active gels are highly tunable. they also indicate existence of an optimal concentration of molecular motors that maximize far-from-equilibrium activity of active isotropic mt gels."
"microtubule defects influence kinesin-based transport in vitro. microtubules are protein polymers that form ""molecular highways"" for long-range transport within living cells. molecular motors actively step along microtubules to shuttle cellular materials between the nucleus and the cell periphery; this transport is critical for the survival and health of all eukaryotic cells. structural defects in microtubules exist, but whether these defects impact molecular motor-based transport remains unknown. here, we report a new, to our knowledge, approach that allowed us to directly investigate the impact of such defects. using a modified optical-trapping method, we examined the group function of a major molecular motor, conventional kinesin, when transporting cargos along individual microtubules. we found that microtubule defects influence kinesin-based transport in vitro. the effects depend on motor number: cargos driven by a few motors tended to unbind prematurely from the microtubule, whereas cargos driven by more motors tended to pause. to our knowledge, our study provides the first direct link between microtubule defects and kinesin function. the effects uncovered in our study may have physiological relevance in vivo."
