"distributed computing by mobile robots: uniform circle formation. consider a set of $n$ simple autonomous mobile robots (asynchronous, no common coordinate system, no identities, no central coordination, no direct communication, no memory of the past, non-rigid, deterministic) initially in distinct locations, moving freely in the plane and able to sense the positions of the other robots. we study the primitive task of the robots arranging themselves on the vertices of a regular $n$-gon not fixed in advance (uniform circle formation). in the literature, the existing algorithmic contributions are limited to conveniently restricted sets of initial configurations of the robots and to more powerful robots. the question of whether such simple robots could deterministically form a uniform circle has remained open. in this paper, we constructively prove that indeed the uniform circle formation problem is solvable for any initial configuration in which the robots are in distinct locations, without any additional assumption (if two robots are in the same location, the problem is easily seen to be unsolvable). in addition to closing a long-standing problem, the result of this paper also implies that, for pattern formation, asynchrony is not a computational handicap, and that additional powers such as chirality and rigidity are computationally irrelevant."
"complete visibility algorithm for autonomous mobile luminous robots under an asynchronous scheduler on grid plane. an autonomous mobile robot system is a distributed system consisting of mobile computational entities (called robots) that autonomously and repeatedly perform three operations: look, compute, and move. various problems related to autonomous mobile robots, such as gathering, pattern formation, or flocking, have been extensively studied to understand the relationship between each robot's capabilities and the solvability of these problems. in this study, we focus on the complete visibility problem, which involves relocating all the robots on an infinite grid plane such that each robot is visible to every other robot. we assume that each robot is a luminous robot (i.e., has a light with a constant number of colors) and opaque (not transparent). in this paper, we propose an algorithm to achieve complete visibility when a set of robots is given. the algorithm ensures that complete visibility is achieved even when robots operate asynchronously and have no knowledge of the total number of robots on the grid plane using only two colors."
"plane formation by synchronous mobile robots without chirality. we consider a distributed system consisting of autonomous mobile computing entities, called robots, moving in a specified space. the robots are anonymous, oblivious, and have neither any access to the global coordinate system nor any explicit communication medium. each robot observes the positions of other robots and moves in terms of its local coordinate system. to investigate the self-organization power of robot systems, formation problems in the two dimensional space (2d-space) have been extensively studied. yamauchi et al. (disc 2015) introduced robot systems in the three dimensional space (3d-space). while existing results for 3d-space assume that the robots agree on the handedness of their local coordinate systems, we remove the assumption and consider the robots without chirality. one of the most fundamental agreement problems in 3d-space is the plane formation problem that requires the robots to land on a common plane, that is not predefined. it has been shown that the solvability of the plane formation problem by robots with chirality is determined by the rotation symmetry of their initial local coordinate systems because the robots cannot break it. we show that when the robots lack chirality, the combination of rotation symmetry and reflection symmetry determines the solvability of the plane formation problem because a set of symmetric local coordinate systems without chirality is obtained by rotations and reflections. this richer symmetry results in the increase of unsolvable instances compared with robots with chirality and a flaw of existing plane formation algorithm. in this paper, we give a characterization of initial configurations from which the robots without chirality can form a plane and a new plane formation algorithm for solvable instances."
