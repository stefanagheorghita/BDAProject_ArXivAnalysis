"indirect detection constraints on s and t channel simplified models of dark matter. recent fermi-lat observations of dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the milky way have placed strong limits on the gamma-ray flux from dark matter annihilation. in order to produce the strongest limit on the dark matter annihilation cross-section, the observations of each dwarf galaxy have typically been ""stacked"" in a joint-likelihood analysis, utilizing optical observations to constrain the dark matter density profile in each dwarf. these limits have typically been computed only for singular annihilation final states, such as $b\bar{b}$ or $\tau^+\tau^-$. in this paper, we generalize this approach by producing an independent joint-likelihood analysis to set constraints on models where the dark matter particle annihilates to multiple final state fermions. we interpret these results in the context of the most popular simplified models, including those with s- and t-channel dark matter annihilation through scalar and vector mediators. we present our results as constraints on the minimum dark matter mass and the mediator sector parameters. additionally, we compare our simplified model results to those of effective field theory contact interactions in the high-mass limit."
"spherical harmonics analysis of fermi gamma-ray data and the galactic dark matter halo. we argue that the decomposition of gamma-ray maps in spherical harmonics is a sensitive tool to study dark matter (dm) annihilation or decay in the main galactic halo of the milky way. using the spherical harmonic decomposition in a window excluding the galactic plane, we show for one year of fermi data that adding a spherical template (such as a line-of-sight dm annihilation profile) to an astrophysical background significantly reduces chi^2 of the fit to the data. in some energy bins the significance of this dm-like fraction is above three sigma. this can be viewed as a hint of dm annihilation signal, although astrophysical sources cannot be ruled out at this moment. we use the derived dm fraction as a conservative upper limit on dm annihilation signal. in the case of bb-bar annihilation channel the limits are about a factor of two less constraining than the limits from dwarf galaxies. the uncertainty of our method is dominated by systematics related to modeling the astrophysical background. we show that with one year of fermi data the statistical sensitivity would be sufficient to detect dm annihilation with thermal freeze out cross section for masses below 100 gev."
"search for gamma-ray emission from $p$-wave dark matter annihilation in the galactic center. indirect searches for dark matter through standard model products of its annihilation generally assume a cross-section which is dominated by a term independent of velocity ($s$-wave annihilation). however, in many dm models an $s$-wave annihilation cross-section is absent or helicity suppressed. to reproduce the correct dm relic density in these models, the leading term in the cross section is proportional to the dm velocity squared ($p$-wave annihilation). indirect detection of such $p$-wave dm is difficult because the average velocities of dm in galaxies today are orders of magnitude slower than the dm velocity at the time of decoupling from the primordial thermal plasma, suppressing the annihilation cross-section today by some five orders of magnitude relative to its value at freeze out. thus $p$-wave dm is out of reach of traditional searches for dm annihilations in the galactic halo. near the region of influence of a central supermassive black hole, such as sgr a$^*$, however, dm can form a localized over-density known as a `spike'. in such spikes the dm is predicted to be both concentrated in space and accelerated to higher velocities, allowing the $\gamma$-ray signature from its annihilation to potentially be detectable above the background. we use the $fermi$ large area telescope to search for the $\gamma$-ray signature of $p$-wave annihilating dm from a spike around sgr a$^*$ in the energy range 10 gev-600 gev. such a signal would appear as a point source and would have a sharp line or box-like spectral features difficult to mimic with standard astrophysical processes, indicating a dm origin. we find no significant excess of $\gamma$ rays in this range, and we place upper limits on the flux in $\gamma$-ray boxes originating from the galactic center. this result, the first of its kind, is interpreted in the context of different models of the dm density near sgr a$^*$."
