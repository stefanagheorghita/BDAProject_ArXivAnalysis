"resource allocation and 3d trajectory design for power-efficient irs-assisted uav-noma communications. in this paper, an intelligent reflecting surface (irs) is introduced to assist an unmanned aerial vehicle (uav) communication system based on non-orthogonal multiple access (noma) for serving multiple ground users. we aim to minimize the average total system energy consumption by jointly designing the resource allocation strategy, the three dimensional (3d) trajectory of the uav, as well as the phase control at the irs. the design is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem taking into account the maximum tolerable outage probability constraint and the individual minimum data rate requirement. to circumvent the intractability of the design problem due to the altitude-dependent rician fading in uav-to-user links, we adopt the deep neural network (dnn) approach to accurately approximate the corresponding effective channel gains, which facilitates the development of a low-complexity suboptimal iterative algorithm via dividing the formulated problem into two subproblems and address them alternatingly. numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can converge to an effective solution within a small number of iterations and illustrate some interesting insights: (1) irs enables a highly flexible uav's 3d trajectory design via recycling the dissipated radio signal for improving the achievable system data rate and reducing the flight power consumption of the uav; (2) irs provides a rich array gain through passive beamforming in the reflection link, which can substantially reduce the required communication power for guaranteeing the required quality-of-service (qos); (3) optimizing the altitude of uav's trajectory can effectively exploit the outage-guaranteed effective channel gain to save the total required communication power enabling power-efficient uav communications."
"real-time video streaming and control of cellular-connected uav system: prototype and performance evaluation. unmanned aerial vehicles (uavs) play an increasingly important role in military, public, and civilian applications, where providing connectivity to uavs is crucial for its real-time control, video streaming, and data collection. considering that cellular networks offer wide area, high speed, and secure wireless connectivity, cellular-connected uavs have been considered as an appealing solution to provide uav connectivity with enhanced reliability, coverage, throughput, and security. due to the nature of uavs mobility, the throughput, reliability and end-to-end (e2e) delay of uavs communication under various flight heights, video resolutions, and transmission frequencies remain unknown. to evaluate these parameters, we develop a cellular-connected uav testbed based on the long term evolution (lte) network with its uplink video transmission and downlink control\&command (cc) transmission. we also design algorithms for sending control signal and controlling uav. the indoor experimental results provide fundamental insights for the cellular-connected uav system design from the perspective of transmission frequency, adaptability, and link outage, respectively."
"network-connected uav communications: potentials and challenges. this article explores the use of network-connected unmanned aerial vehicle (uav) communications as a compelling solution to achieve high-rate information transmission and support ultra-reliable uav remote command and control. we first discuss the use cases of uavs and the resulting communication requirements, accompanied with a flexible architecture for network-connected uav communications. then, the signal transmission and interference characteristics are theoretically analyzed, and subsequently we highlight the design and optimization considerations, including antenna design, non-orthogonal multiple access communications, as well as network selection and association optimization. finally, case studies are provided to show the feasibility of network-connected uav communications."
