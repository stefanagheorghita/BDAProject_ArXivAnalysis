"dark energy: investigation and modeling. constantly accumulating observational data continue to confirm that about 70% of the energy density today consists of dark energy responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe. we present recent observational bounds on dark energy constrained by the type ia supernovae, cosmic microwave background, and baryon acoustic oscillations. we review a number of theoretical approaches that have been adopted so far to explain the origin of dark energy. this includes the cosmological constant, modified matter models (such as quintessence, k-essence, coupled dark energy, unified models of dark energy and dark matter), modified gravity models (such as f(r) gravity, scalar-tensor theories, braneworlds), and inhomogeneous models. we also discuss observational and experimental constraints on those models and clarify which models are favored or ruled out in current observations."
constraints on the dark energy equation of state from recent supernova data. measurements suggest that our universe has a substantial dark energy component. the most recent data on type ia supernovae give a dark energy density which is in good agreement with other measurements if the dark energy is assumed to be a cosmological constant. here we examine to what extent that data can put constraints on a more general equation of state for the dark energy.
"investigating dark energy equation of state with high redshift hubble diagram. several independent cosmological data, collected within the last twenty years, revealed the accelerated expansion rate of the universe, usually assumed to be driven by the so called dark energy, which, according to recent estimates, provides now about 70 % of the total amount of matter-energy in the universe. the nature of dark energy is yet unknown. several models of dark energy have been proposed: a non zero cosmological constant, a potential energy of some self interacting scalar field, effects related to the non homogeneous distribution of matter, or effects due to alternative theories of gravity. recently, it turned out that the standard flat lambdacdm is disfavored (at 4 sigma) when confronted with a high redshift hubble diagram, consisting of supernovae of type ia (snia), quasars (qsos) and gamma ray-bursts (grbs) ([1-3]). here we use the same data to investigate if this tension is confirmed, using a different approach: actually in [1-3], the deviation between the best fit model and the lambdacdm model was noticed by comparing cosmological parameters derived from cosmographic expansions of their theoretical predictions and observed high redshift hubble diagram. in this paper we use a substantially different approach, based on a specific parametrization of the redshift dependent equation of state (eos) of dark energy component w(z). our statistical analysis is aimed to estimate the parameters characterizing the dark energy eos: our results indicate (at > 3 sigma level) an evolving dark energy eos, while the cosmological constant has a constant eos, wlambda =-1. this result not only confirms the tension previously detected, but shows that it is not an artifact of cosmographic expansions."
