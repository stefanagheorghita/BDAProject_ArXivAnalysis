"low-reynolds number swimming in a capillary tube. we use the boundary element method to study the low-reynolds number locomotion of a spherical model microorganism in a circular tube. the swimmer propels itself by tangen- tial or normal surface motion in a tube whose radius is on the order of the swimmer size. hydrodynamic interactions with the tube walls significantly affect the average swimming speed and power consumption of the model microorganism. in the case of swimming parallel to the tube axis, the locomotion speed is always reduced (resp. increased) for swimmers with tangential (resp. normal) deformation. in all cases, the rate of work nec- essary for swimming is increased by confinement. swimmers with no force-dipoles in the far field generally follow helical trajectories, solely induced by hydrodynamic interactions with the tube walls, and in qualitative agreement with recent experimental observations for paramecium. swimmers of the puller type always display stable locomotion at a lo- cation which depends on the strength of their force dipoles: swimmers with weak dipoles (small {\alpha}) swim in the centre of the tube while those with strong dipoles (large {\alpha}) swim near the walls. in contrast, pusher swimmers and those employing normal deformation are unstable and end up crashing into the walls of the tube. similar dynamics is observed for swimming into a curved tube. these results could be relevant for the future design of artificial microswimmers in confined geometries."
"inferring characteristics of bacterial swimming in biofilm matrix from time-lapse confocal laser scanning microscopy. biofilms are spatially organized microorganism colonies embedded in a self-produced matrix, conferring to the microbial community resistance to environmental stresses. motile bacteria have been observed swimming in the matrix of pathogenic exogeneous host biofilms. this observation opened new promising routes for deleterious biofilms biocontrol: these bacterial swimmers enhance biofilm vascularization for chemical treatment or could deliver biocontrol agent by microbial hitchhiking or local synthesis. %\cite{muok2021microbial,yu2020hitchhiking,samad2017swimming}. hence, characterizing swimmer trajectories in the biofilm matrix is of particular interest to understand and optimize its biocontrol.in this study, a new methodology is developed to analyze time-lapse confocal laser scanning images to describe and compare the swimming trajectories of bacterial swimmers populations and their adaptations to the biofilm structure. the method is based on the inference of a kinetic model of swimmer population including mechanistic interactions with the host biofilm. after validation on synthetic data, the methodology is implemented on images of three different motile {bacillus species swimming in a staphylococcus aureus biofilm. the fitted model allows to stratify the swimmer populations by their swimming behavior and provides insights into the mechanisms deployed by the micro-swimmers to adapt their swimming traits to the biofilm matrix."
"effective medium model for a suspension of active swimmers. several active organisms in nature tend to reside as a community in a viscous fluid medium. we analyze the variation of swimming characteristics of an active swimmer present in a dilute and disperse suspension, modeled as an effective brinkman medium. this idealized representation of a collection of active swimmers allows one to distinguish the impact of the interior domain available to an individual swimmer as well as the contribution of its neighbors. darcy's law along with the analytical solution enables the effective resistivity to be predicted as a function of the volume fraction which is in close agreement with the well-known carman-kozeny equation. this facilitates the successive analysis of the propulsion speed, power dissipation, and swimming efficiency of the targeted swimmer as a function of the volume fraction which is decisive in nutrient transport and uptake or reproduction in a collective environment. a stress-jump condition is also imposed across a cell to indicate a mean effective force due to the nearby swimmers. at suitable values of this stress-jump coefficient, the relative increase of the migration velocity and swimming efficiency is noticeably higher at an optimum occupancy."
