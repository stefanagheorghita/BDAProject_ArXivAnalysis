"scalar and vector one-loop massive tadpole light-front gauge feynman integrals. light-front gauge is the most popular one to work with fundamental interactions, due to its characteristic maximum kinematical poincare operators that it allows. however, it is also known to be one of the trickiest gauges one can work with for gauge theories, due to its singular nature. so, in terms of perturbative calculations in the light-front, there are only a few published and tabulated results for the pertinent feynman integrals, mostly involving massless integrals. and the majority of the results given are only for the divergent parts of them and the complete closed form (or with the finite parts) of these are not known. in this manuscript, we use the technique of negative dimensional integration (ndim) for the simplest of the one-loop massive integrals as a working bench for massive feynman integrals in the light-front and show that novel results for the finite parts not known before are obtained."
"empirical determinations of feynman integrals using integer relation algorithms. integer relation algorithms can convert numerical results for feynman integrals to exact evaluations, when one has reason to suspect the existence of reductions to linear combinations of a basis, with rational or algebraic coefficients. once a tentative reduction is obtained, confidence in its validity is greatly increased by computing more decimal digits of the terms and verifying the stability of the result. here we give examples of how the pslq and lll algorithms have yielded remarkable reductions of feynman integrals to multiple polylogarithms and to the periods and quasi-periods of modular forms. moreover, these algorithms have revealed quadratic relations between feynman integrals. a recent application concerning black holes involves quadratic relations between combinations of feynman integrals with algebraic coefficients."
"feynman integrals from positivity constraints. we explore inequality constraints as a new tool for numerically evaluating feynman integrals. a convergent feynman integral is non-negative if the integrand is non-negative in either loop momentum space or feynman parameter space. applying various identities, all such integrals can be reduced to linear sums of a small set of master integrals, leading to infinitely many linear constraints on the values of the master integrals. the constraints can be solved as a semidefinite programming problem in mathematical optimization, producing rigorous two-sided bounds for the integrals which are observed to converge rapidly as more constraints are included, enabling high-precision determination of the integrals. positivity constraints can also be formulated for the $\epsilon$ expansion terms in dimensional regularization and reveal hidden consistency relations between terms at different orders in $\epsilon$. we introduce the main methods using one-loop bubble integrals, then present a nontrivial example of three-loop banana integrals with unequal masses, where 11 top-level master integrals are evaluated to high precision."
