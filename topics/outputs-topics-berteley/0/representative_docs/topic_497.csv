"pattern formation in colloidal explosions. we study the non-equilibrium pattern formation that emerges when magnetically repelling colloids, trapped by optical tweezers, are abruptly released, forming colloidal explosions. for multiple colloids in a single trap we observe a pattern of expanding concentric rings. for colloids individually trapped in a line, we observe explosions with a zigzag pattern that persists even when magnetic interactions are much weaker than those that break the linear symmetry in equilibrium. theory and computer simulations quantitatively describe these phenomena both in and out of equilibrium. an analysis of the mode spectrum allows us to accurately quantify the non-harmonic nature of the optical traps. colloidal explosions provide a new way to generate well-characterized non-equilibrium behaviour in colloidal systems."
"influence of fluid flows on electric double layers in evaporating colloidal sessile droplets. a model is developed for describing the transport of charged colloidal particles in an evaporating sessile droplet on the electrified metal substrate in the presence of a solvent flow. the model takes into account the electric charge of colloidal particles and small ions produced by electrolytic dissociation of the active groups on the colloidal particles and solvent molecules. we employ a system of self-consistent poisson and nernst--planck equations for electric potential and average concentrations of colloidal particles and ions with the appropriate boundary conditions. the fluid dynamics, temperature distribution and evaporation process are described with the navier--stokes equations, equations of heat conduction and vapor diffusion in air, respectively. the developed model is used to carry out a first-principles numerical simulation of charged silica colloidal particle transport in an evaporating aqueous droplet. we find that electric double layers can be destroyed by a sufficiently strong fluid flow."
"scattering approach for fluctuation--induced interactions at fluid interfaces. we develop the scattering formalism to calculate the interaction between colloidal particles trapped at a fluid interface. since, in addition to the interface, the colloids may also fluctuate in this system, we implement the fluctuation of the boundaries into the scattering formalism and investigate how the interaction between colloids is modified by their fluctuations. this general method can be applied to any number of colloids with various geometries at an interface. we apply the formalism derived in this work to a system of spherical colloids at the interface between two fluid phases. for two spherical colloids, this method very effectively reproduces the previous known results. for three particles we find analytical expressions for the large separation asymptotic energies and numerically calculate the casimir interaction at all separations. our results show an interesting three body effect for fixed and fluctuating colloids. while the three body effect strengthens the attractive interaction between fluctuating colloids, it diminishes the attractive force between colloids fixed at an interface."
