"finsler metrics of weakly isotropic flag curvature. finsler metrics of scalar flag curvature play an important role to show the complexity and richness of general finsler metrics. in this paper, on an $n$-dimensional manifold $m$ we study the finsler metric $f=f(x,y)$ of scalar flag curvature ${\bf k} = {\bf k}(x,y)$ and discover some equations ${\bf k}$ should be satisfied. as an application, we mainly study the metric $f$ of weakly isotropic flag curvature ${\bf k} = \frac{3 \theta}{f} + \sigma$, where $\theta=\theta_i(x) y^i \neq 0$ is a $1$-form and $\sigma =\sigma(x)$ is a scalar function. we prove that in this case, $f$ must be a randers metric when $dim(m) \geq 3$. further, without the restriction on the dimension we prove that projectively flat finsler metrics of such weakly isotropic flag curvature are randers metrics too."
"on projective symmetries on finsler spaces. there are two definitions of einstein-finsler spaces introduced by akbar-zadeh, which we will show is equal along the integral curves of $i$-invariant projective vector fields. the sub-algebra of the $c$-projective vector fields, leaving the $h$-curvature invariant, has been studied extensively. here we show on a closed finsler space with negative definite ricci curvature reduces to that of killing vector fields. moreover, if an einstein-finsler space admits such a projective vector field then the flag curvature is constant. finally, a classification of compact isotropic mean landsberg manifolds admitting certain projective vector fields is obtained with respect to the sign of ricci curvature."
"new special finsler spaces. the pullback approach to global finsler geometry is adopted. some new types of special finsler spaces are introduced and investigated, namely, ricci, generalized ricci, projectively recurrent and m-projectively recurrent finsler spaces. the properties of these special finsler spaces are studied and the relations between them are singled out."
