"visualization equilibrium. in many real-world strategic settings, people use information displays to make decisions. in these settings, an information provider chooses which information to provide to strategic agents and how to present it, and agents formulate a best response based on the information and their anticipation of how others will behave. we contribute the results of a controlled online experiment to examine how the provision and presentation of information impacts people's decisions in a congestion game. our experiment compares how different visualization approaches for displaying this information, including bar charts and hypothetical outcome plots, and different information conditions, including where the visualized information is private versus public (i.e., available to all agents), affect decision making and welfare. we characterize the effects of visualization anticipation, referring to changes to behavior when an agent goes from alone having access to a visualization to knowing that others also have access to the visualization to guide their decisions. we also empirically identify the visualization equilibrium, i.e., the visualization for which the visualized outcome of agents' decisions matches the realized decisions of the agents who view it. we reflect on the implications of visualization equilibria and visualization anticipation for designing information displays for real-world strategic settings."
"an automated approach to reasoning about task-oriented insights in responsive visualization. authors often transform a large screen visualization for smaller displays through rescaling, aggregation and other techniques when creating visualizations for both desktop and mobile devices (i.e., responsive visualization). however, transformations can alter relationships or patterns implied by the large screen view, requiring authors to reason carefully about what information to preserve while adjusting their design for the smaller display. we propose an automated approach to approximating the loss of support for task-oriented visualization insights (identification, comparison, and trend) in responsive transformation of a source visualization. we operationalize identification, comparison, and trend loss as objective functions calculated by comparing properties of the rendered source visualization to each realized target (small screen) visualization. to evaluate the utility of our approach, we train machine learning models on human ranked small screen alternative visualizations across a set of source visualizations. we find that our approach achieves an accuracy of 84% (random forest model) in ranking visualizations. we demonstrate this approach in a prototype responsive visualization recommender that enumerates responsive transformations using answer set programming and evaluates the preservation of task-oriented insights using our loss measures. we discuss implications of our approach for the development of automated and semi-automated responsive visualization recommendation."
"time series information visualization -- a review of approaches and tools. time series data are prevalent across various domains and often encompass large datasets containing multiple time-dependent features in each sample. exploring time-varying data is critical for data science practitioners aiming to understand dynamic behaviors and discover periodic patterns and trends. however, the analysis of such data often requires sophisticated procedures and tools. information visualization is a communication channel that leverages human perceptual abilities to transform abstract data into visual representations. visualization techniques have been successfully applied in the context of time series to enhance interpretability by graphically representing the temporal evolution of data. the challenge for information visualization developers lies in integrating a wide range of analytical tools into rich visualization systems that can summarize complex datasets while clearly describing the impacts of the temporal component. such systems enable data scientists to turn raw data into understandable and potentially useful knowledge. this review examines techniques and approaches designed for handling time series data, guiding users through knowledge discovery processes based on visual analysis. we also provide readers with theoretical insights and design guidelines for considering when developing comprehensive information visualization approaches for time series, with a particular focus on time series with multiple features. as a result, we highlight the challenges and future research directions to address open questions in the visualization of time-dependent data."
