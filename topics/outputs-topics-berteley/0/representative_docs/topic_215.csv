"volume maximization and the extended hyperbolic space. we consider a volume maximization program to construct hyperbolic structures on triangulated 3-manifolds, for which previous progress has lead to consider angle assignments which do not correspond to a hyperbolic metric on each simplex. we show that critical points of the generalized volume are associated to geometric structures modeled on the extended hyperbolic space -- the natural extension of hyperbolic space by the de sitter space -- except for the degenerate case where all simplices are euclidean in a generalized sense. those extended hyperbolic structures can realize geometrically a decomposition of the manifold as connected sum, along embedded spheres (or projective planes) which are totally geodesic, space-like surfaces in the de sitter part of the extended hyperbolic structure."
"arithmeticity, superrigidity and totally geodesic submanifolds of complex hyperbolic manifolds. for $n \ge 2$, we prove that a finite volume complex hyperbolic $n$-manifold containing infinitely many maximal properly immersed totally geodesic submanifolds of dimension at least two is arithmetic, paralleling our previous work for real hyperbolic manifolds. as in the real hyperbolic case, our primary result is a superrigidity theorem for certain representations of complex hyperbolic lattices. the proof requires developing new general tools not needed in the real hyperbolic case. our main results also have a number of other applications. for example, we prove nonexistence of certain maps between complex hyperbolic manifolds, which is related to a question of siu, that certain hyperbolic $3$-manifolds cannot be totally geodesic submanifolds of complex hyperbolic manifolds, and that arithmeticity of complex hyperbolic manifolds is detected purely by the topology of the underlying complex variety, which is related to a question of margulis. our results also provide some evidence for a conjecture of klingler that is a broad generalization of the zilber--pink conjecture."
"flat surfaces. various problems of geometry, topology and dynamical systems on surfaces as well as some questions concerning one-dimensional dynamical systems lead to the study of closed surfaces endowed with a flat metric with several cone-type singularities. such flat surfaces are naturally organized into families which appear to be isomorphic to the moduli spaces of holomorphic one-forms. one can obtain much information about the geometry and dynamics of an individual flat surface by studying both its orbit under the teichmuller geodesic flow and under the linear group action. in particular, the teichmuller geodesic flow plays the role of a time acceleration machine (renormalization procedure) which allows to study the asymptotic behavior of interval exchange transformations and of surface foliations. this long survey is an attempt to present some selected ideas, concepts and facts in teichmuller dynamics in a playful way."
