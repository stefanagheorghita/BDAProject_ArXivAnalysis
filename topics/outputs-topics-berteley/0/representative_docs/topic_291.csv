"designing efficient programmable quantum circuits. constructing general programmable circuits to be able to run any given unitary operator efficiently on a quantum processor is of fundamental importance. we present a new quantum circuit design technique resulting two general programmable circuit schemes. the circuit schemes can be used to simulate any given operator by setting the angle values in the circuit. this provides a fixed circuit design whose angles are determined from the elements of the given matrix, which can be non-unitary, in an efficient way. we also give both classical and quantum complexity analysis for these circuits and show that the circuits require a few classical computations, and the quantum complexities of them are almost the same as non-general circuits."
"circuit connectivity boosts by quantum-classical-quantum interfaces. high-connectivity circuits are a major roadblock for current quantum hardware. we propose a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm to simulate such circuits without swap-gate ladders. as main technical tool, we introduce quantum-classical-quantum interfaces. these replace an experimentally problematic gate (e.g. a long-range one) by single-qubit random measurements followed by state-preparations sampled according to a classical quasi-probability simulation of the noiseless gate. each interface introduces a multiplicative statistical overhead which is remarkably independent of the on-chip qubit distance. hence, by applying interfaces to the longest range gates in a target circuit, significant reductions in circuit depth and gate infidelity can be attained. we numerically show the efficacy of our method for a bell-state circuit for two increasingly distant qubits and a variational ground-state solver for the transverse-field ising model on a ring. our findings provide a versatile toolbox for error-mitigation and circuit boosts tailored for noisy, intermediate-scale quantum computation."
"optimization and synthesis of quantum circuits with global gates. compiling quantum circuits to account for hardware restrictions is an essential part of the quantum computing stack. circuit compilation allows us to adapt algorithm descriptions into a sequence of operations supported by real quantum hardware, and has the potential to significantly improve their performance when optimization techniques are added to the process. one such optimization technique is reducing the number of quantum gates that are needed to execute a circuit. for instance, methods for reducing the number of non-clifford gates or cnot gates from a circuit is an extensive research area that has gathered significant interest over the years. for certain hardware platforms such as ion trap quantum computers, we can leverage some of their special properties to further reduce the cost of executing a quantum circuit in them. in this work we use global interactions, such as the global m{\o}lmer-s{\o}rensen gate present in ion trap hardware, to optimize and synthesize quantum circuits. we design and implement an algorithm that is able to compile an arbitrary quantum circuit into another circuit that uses global gates as the entangling operation, while optimizing the number of global interactions needed. the algorithm is based on the zx-calculus and uses an specialized circuit extraction routine that groups entangling gates into global m{\o}lmer-s{\o}rensen gates. we benchmark the algorithm in a variety of circuits, and show how it improves their performance under state-of-the-art hardware considerations in comparison to a naive algorithm and the qiskit optimizer."
