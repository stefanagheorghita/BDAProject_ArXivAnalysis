"high fidelity resonant gating of a silicon based quantum dot hybrid qubit. isolated spins in semiconductors provide a promising platform to explore quantum mechanical coherence and develop engineered quantum systems. silicon has attracted great interest as a host material for developing spin qubits because of its weak spin-orbit coupling and hyperfine interaction, and several architectures based on gate defined quantum dots have been proposed and demonstrated experimentally. recently, a quantum dot hybrid qubit formed by three electrons in double quantum dot was proposed, and non-adiabatic pulsed-gate operation was implemented experimentally, demonstrating simple and fast electrical manipulations of spin states with a promising ratio of coherence time to manipulation time. however, the overall gate fidelity of the pulse-gated hybrid qubit is limited by relatively fast dephasing due to charge noise during one of the two required gate operations. here we perform the first microwave-driven gate operations of a quantum dot hybrid qubit, avoiding entirely the regime in which it is most sensitive to charge noise. resonant detuning modulation along with phase control of the microwaves enables a pi rotation time of less than 5 ns (50 ps) around x(z)-axis with high fidelities > 93 (96) %. we also implement hahn echo and carr-purcell (cp) dynamic decoupling sequences with which we demonstrate a coherence time of over 150 ns. we further discuss a pathway to improve gate fidelity to above 99 %, exceeding the threshold for surface code based quantum error correction."
"phase readout of a charge qubit capacitively coupled to an open double quantum dot. we study the dynamics of a charge qubit that is capacitively coupled to an open double quantum dot. depending on the qubit state, the transport through the open quantum dot may be resonant or off-resonant, such that the qubit affects the current through the open double dot. we relate the initial qubit state to the magnitude of an emerging transient current peak. the relation between these quantities enables the readout of not only the charge but also the phase of the qubit."
"quantum gates between two spins in a triple dot system with an empty dot. we propose a scheme for implementing quantum gates and entanglement between spin qubits in the outer dots of a triple-dot system with an empty central dot. the voltage applied to the central dot can be tuned to realize the gate. our scheme exemplifies the possibility of quantum gates outside the regime where each dot has an electron, so that spin-spin exchange interaction is not the only relevant mechanism. analytic treatment is possible by mapping the problem to a t-j model. the fidelity of the entangling quantum gate between the spins is analyzed in the presence of decoherence stemming from a bath of nuclear spins, as well as from charge fluctuations. our scheme provides an avenue for extending the scope of two qubit gate experiments to triple-dots, while requiring minimal control, namely that of the potential of a single dot, and may enhance the qubit separation to ease differential addressability."
