"spin relaxation of localized electrons in n-type semiconductors. the mechanisms that determine spin relaxation times of localized electrons in impurity bands of n-type semiconductors are considered theoretically and compared with available experimental data. the relaxation time of the non-equilibrium angular momentum is shown to be limited either by hyperfine interaction, or by spin-orbit interaction in course of exchange-induced spin diffusion. the energy relaxation time in the spin system is governed by phonon-assisted hops within pairs of donors with an optimal distance of about 4 bohr radii. the spin correlation time of the donor-bound electron is determined either by exchange interaction with other localized electrons, or by spin-flip scattering of free conduction-band electrons. a possibility of optical cooling of the spin system of localized electrons is discussed."
"control of spin relaxation anisotropy by spin-orbit-coupled diffusive spin motion. spatiotemporal spin dynamics under spin-orbit interaction is investigated in a (001) gaas two-dimensional electron gas using magneto-optical kerr rotation microscopy. spin polarized electrons are diffused away from the excited position, resulting in spin precession because of the diffusion-induced spin-orbit field. near the cancellation between spin-orbit field and external magnetic field, the induced spin precession frequency depends nonlinearly on the diffusion velocity, which is unexpected from the conventional linear relation between the spin-orbit field and the electron velocity.this behavior originates from an enhancement of the spin relaxation anisotropy by the electron velocity perpendicular to the diffused direction. we demonstrate that the spin relaxation anisotropy, which has been regarded as a material constant, can be controlled via diffusive electron motion."
"magnetic field effect on electron spin dynamics in (110) gaas quantum wells. we study the electron spin relaxation in both symmetric and asymmetric gaas/algaas quantum wells (qws) grown on (110) substrates in an external magnetic field b applied along the qw normal. the spin polarization is induced by circularly polarized light and detected by time-resolved kerr rotation technique. in the asymmetric structure, where a {\delta}-doped layer on one side of the qw produces the rashba contribution to the conduction-band spin-orbit splitting, the lifetime of electron spins aligned along the growth axis exhibits an anomalous dependence on b in the range 0<b<0.5 t; this results from the interplay between the dresselhaus and rashba effective fields which are perpendicular to each other. for larger magnetic fields, the spin lifetime increases, which is the consequence of the cyclotron motion of the electrons and is also observed in (001)-grown quantum wells. the experimental results are in agreement with the calculation of the spin lifetimes in (110)- grown asymmetric quantum wells described by the point group cs where the growth direction is not the principal axis of the spin-relaxation-rate tensor."
