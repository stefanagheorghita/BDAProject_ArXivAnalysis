"narasimhan--simha type metrics on strongly pseudoconvex domains in $\mathbb{c}^n$. for a bounded domain $d \subset \mathbb{c}^n$, let $k_d = k_d(z) > 0$ denote the bergman kernel on the diagonal and consider the reproducing kernel hilbert space of holomorphic functions on $d$ that are square integrable with respect to the weight $k_d^{-d}$, where $d \geq 0$ is an integer. the corresponding weighted kernel $k_{d, d}$ transforms appropriately under biholomorphisms and hence produces an invariant k\""{a}hler metric on $d$. thus, there is a hierarchy of such metrics starting with the classical bergman metric that corresponds to the case $d=0$. this note is an attempt to study this class of metrics in much the same way as the bergman metric has been with a view towards identifying properties that are common to this family. when $d$ is strongly pseudoconvex, the scaling principle is used to obtain the boundary asymptotics of these metrics and several invariants associated to them. it turns out that all these metrics are complete on strongly pseudoconvex domains."
"compactness of the $\bar{\partial}$-neumann problem on domains with bounded intrinsic geometry. by considering intrinsic geometric conditions, we introduce a new class of domains in complex euclidean space. this class is invariant under biholomorphism and includes strongly pseudoconvex domains, finite type domains in dimension two, convex domains, $\mathbb{c}$-convex domains, and homogeneous domains. for this class of domains, we show that compactness of the $\bar{\partial}$-neumann operator on $(0,q)$-forms is equivalent to the boundary not containing any $q$-dimensional analytic varieties (assuming only that the boundary is a topological submanifold). we also prove, for this class of domains, that the bergman metric is equivalent to the kobayashi metric and that the pluricomplex green function satisfies certain local estimates in terms of the bergman metric."
"bicomplex algebra and function theory. this treatise investigates holomorphic functions defined on the space of bicomplex numbers introduced by segre. the theory of these functions is associated with fueter's theory of regular, quaternionic functions. the algebras of quaternions and bicomplex numbers are developed by making use of so-called complex pairs. special attention is paid to singular bicomplex numbers that lack an inverse. the elementary bicomplex functions are defined and their properties studied. the derivative of a bicomplex function is defined as the limit of a fraction with nonsingular denominator. the existence of the derivative amounts to the validity of the complexified cauchy-riemann equations, which characterize the holomorphic bicomplex functions. it is proved that such a function has derivatives of all orders. the bicomplex integral is defined as a line integral. the condition for path independence and the bicomplex generalizations of cauchy's theorem and integral formula are given. finally, the relationship between the bicomplex functions and different forms of the laplace equation is considered. in particular, the four-dimensional laplace equation is factorized using quaternionic differential operators. the outcome is new classes of bicomplex functions including fueter's regular functions. it is shown that each class contains differentiable functions."
