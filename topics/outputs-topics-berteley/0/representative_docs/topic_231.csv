"training deep neural networks with adaptive momentum inspired by the quadratic optimization. heavy ball momentum is crucial in accelerating (stochastic) gradient-based optimization algorithms for machine learning. existing heavy ball momentum is usually weighted by a uniform hyperparameter, which relies on excessive tuning. moreover, the calibrated fixed hyperparameter may not lead to optimal performance. in this paper, to eliminate the effort for tuning the momentum-related hyperparameter, we propose a new adaptive momentum inspired by the optimal choice of the heavy ball momentum for quadratic optimization. our proposed adaptive heavy ball momentum can improve stochastic gradient descent (sgd) and adam. sgd and adam with the newly designed adaptive momentum are more robust to large learning rates, converge faster, and generalize better than the baselines. we verify the efficiency of sgd and adam with the new adaptive momentum on extensive machine learning benchmarks, including image classification, language modeling, and machine translation. finally, we provide convergence guarantees for sgd and adam with the proposed adaptive momentum."
"singularity-free spacecraft attitude control using variable-speed control moment gyroscopes. this paper discusses spacecraft control using variable-speed cmgs. a new operational concept for vscmgs is proposed. this new concept makes it possible to approximate the complex nonlinear system by a linear time-varying system (ltv). as a result, an effective control system design method, model predictive control (mpc) using robust pole assignment, can be used to design the spacecraft control system using vscmgs. a nice feature of this design is that the control system does not have any singular point. a design example is provided. the simulation result shows the effectiveness of the proposed method."
"mpc on manifolds with an application to the control of spacecraft attitude on so(3). we develop a model predictive control (mpc) design for systems with discrete-time dynamics evolving on smooth manifolds. we show that the properties of conventional mpc for dynamics evolving on $\mathbb r^n$ are preserved and we develop a design procedure for achieving similar properties. we also demonstrate that for discrete-time dynamics on manifolds with euler characteristic not equal to 1, there do not exist globally stabilizing, continuous control laws. the mpc law is able to achieve global asymptotic stability on these manifolds, because the mpc law may be discontinuous. we apply the method to spacecraft attitude control, where the spacecraft attitude evolves on the lie group so(3) and for which a continuous globally stabilizing control law does not exist. in this case, the mpc law is discontinuous and achieves global stability."
