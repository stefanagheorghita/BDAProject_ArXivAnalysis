"dark energy reconstructions combining bao data with galaxy clusters and intermediate redshift catalogs. cosmological parameters and dark energy (de) behavior are generally constrained assuming \textit{a priori} models. we work out a model-independent reconstruction to bound the key cosmological quantities and the de evolution. through the model-independent \textit{b\'ezier interpolation} method, we reconstruct the hubble rate from the observational hubble data and derive analytic expressions for the distances of galaxy clusters, type ia supernovae, and uncorrelated baryonic acoustic oscillation (bao) data. in view of the discrepancy between sloan digital sky survey (sdss) and dark energy spectroscopic instrument (desi) bao data, they are kept separate in two distinct analyses. correlated bao data are employed to break the baryonic--dark matter degeneracy. all these interpolations enable us to single out and reconstruct the de behavior with the redshift $z$ in a totally model-independent way. in both analyses, with sdss-bao or desi-bao data sets, the constraints agree at $1$--$\sigma$ confidence level (cl) with the flat $\lambda$cdm model. the hubble constant tension appears solved in favor of the planck satellite value. the reconstructed de behavior exhibits deviations at small $z$ ($>1$--$\sigma$ cl), but agrees ($<1$--$\sigma$ cl) with the cosmological constant paradigm at larger $z$. our method hints for a slowly evolving de, consistent with a cosmological constant at early times."
"effect of peak absolute magnitude of type ia supernovae and sound horizon values on hubble tension using desi results. we apply data-motivated priors on the peak absolute magnitude of type ia supernovae ($m$) and the sound horizon at the drag epoch ($r_d$), to study how the $m-r_d$ degeneracy affects low redshift measurements of the hubble constant, and then compare these estimates to the planck estimated value of the hubble constant. we use the data from pantheon$+$, cosmic chronometers, and the dark energy spectroscopic instrument data release 1 (desi dr1) baryon acoustic oscillations (bao) results for this purpose. we reaffirm the fact that there is a degeneracy between $m$ and $r_d$, and modifying the $r_d$ values to reconcile the discrepancy in hubble constant values also requires a change in the peak absolute magnitude $m$. for certain $m$ and $r_d$ priors, the discrepancy is found to reduce to be as low as (1.2-2) $\sigma$ when considering the spatially flat $\lambda$cdm model. we also notice that for our datasets considered, the gaussian prior combination of $m \in \mathcal{n} (-19.253,0.027)$ (obtained from sh0es) and $r_d \in \mathcal{n} (147.05,0.3)$ mpc (determined from planck cmb measurements) is least favored as compared to other prior combinations for the $\lambda$cdm model."
"cosmological constraints on the undulant universe. we use the redshift hubble parameter $h(z)$ data derived from relative galaxy ages, distant type ia supernovae (sne ia), the baryonic acoustic oscillation (bao) peak, and the cosmic microwave background (cmb) shift parameter data, to constrain cosmological parameters in the undulant universe. we marginalize the likelihood functions over $h$ by integrating the probability density $p\propto e^{-\chi^2/2}$. by using the markov chain monte carlo (mcmc) technique, we obtain the best fitting results and give the confidence regions on the $b-\omega_{\rm m0}$ plane. then we compare their constraints. our results show that the $h(z)$ data play a similar role with the sne ia data in cosmological study. by presenting the independent and joint constraints, we find that the bao and cmb data play very important roles in breaking the degeneracy compared with the $h(z)$ and sne ia data alone. combined with the bao or cmb data, one can improve the constraints remarkably. the sne ia data sets constrain $\omega_{\rm m0}$ much tighter than the $h(z)$ data sets, but the $h(z)$ data sets constrain $b$ much tighter than the sne ia data sets. all these results show that the undulant universe approaches the $\lambda \rm$cdm model. we expect more $h(z)$ data to constrain cosmological parameters in future."
