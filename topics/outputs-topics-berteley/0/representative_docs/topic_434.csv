"uniform attractors for non-autonomous wave equations with nonlinear damping. we consider dynamical behavior of non-autonomous wave-type evolutionary equations with nonlinear damping, critical nonlinearity, and time-dependent external forcing which is translation bounded but not translation compact (i.e., external forcing is not necessarily time-periodic, quasi-periodic or almost periodic). a sufficient and necessary condition for the existence of uniform attractors is established using the concept of uniform asymptotic compactness. the required compactness for the existence of uniform attractors is then fulfilled by some new a priori estimates for concrete wave type equations arising from applications. the structure of uniform attractors is obtained by constructing a skew product flow on the extended phase space for the norm-to-weak continuous process."
"long-time dynamics in plate models with strong nonlinear damping. we study long-time dynamics of a class of abstract second order in time evolution equations in a hilbert space with the damping term depending both on displacement and velocity. this damping represents the nonlinear strong dissipation phenomenon perturbed with relatively compact terms. our main result states the existence of a compact finite dimensional attractor. we study properties of this attractor. we also establish the existence of a fractal exponential attractor and give the conditions that guarantee the existence of a finite number of determining functionals. in the case when the set of equilibria is finite and hyperbolic we show that every trajectory is attracted by some equilibrium with exponential rate. our arguments involve a recently developed method based on the ""compensated"" compactness and quasi-stability estimates. as an application we consider the nonlinear kirchhoff, karman and berger plate models with different types of boundary conditions and strong damping terms. our results can be also applied to the nonlinear wave equations."
"topological dimensions of global attractors for a delayed reaction-diffusion equation on an unbounded domain. the purpose of this paper is to investigate the existence and estimation of hausdorff and fractal dimension of global attractors for a delayed reaction-diffusion equation on an unbounded domain. the noncompactness of the domain cause the laplace operator has a continuous spectrum, the semigroup generated by the linear part and the sobolev embeddings no longer compact, making the problem more difficult compared with the equation on bounded domain. in order to adopt hausdorff and fractal dimension dimension estimation tools established for dynamical systems in hilbert space, we recast the equation in an auxiliary hilbert space. we first obtain the existence of global solutions on unbounded domain by a perturbation semigroup approach which generates an infinite dimensional dynamical system. then, we show the existence of global attractors by firstly showing the existence of an absorbing set and then give a an uniform a priori estimates for far-field values of solutions which facilitate us to prove the asymptotic compactness of the generated dynamical system. after establishing the variational equation in the auxiliary hilbert space and the differentiable properties of the generated dynamical system, the upper estimate of both hausdorff and fractal dimensions of the global attractors is obtained."
