polynomial continued fractions for algebraic numbers. our main result is that any real cubic algebraic number has a continued fraction expansion with polynomial coefficients. some generalizations are mentioned.
"double sums associated with binomial transforms. in this paper, we continue our investigation of double sums where the inner sum is binomial but incomplete. we prove many new results for these types of double sums associated with binomial transform pairs. as applications we deduce new identities for double sums involving special numbers like bernoulli numbers, fibonacci numbers, harmonic numbers, catalan numbers and stirling numbers of the second kind. we also consider families of polynomials like fibonacci polynomials, chebyshev polynomials, bernoulli polynomials, and others. finally, we state new double sums involving hyperbolic functions."
"real numbers with polynomial continued fraction expansions. in this paper we show how to apply various techniques and theorems (including pincherle's theorem, an extension of euler's formula equating infinite series and continued fractions, an extension of the corresponding transformation that equates infinite products and continued fractions, extensions and contractions of continued fractions and the bauer-muir transformation) to derive infinite families of in-equivalent polynomial continued fractions in which each continued fraction has the same limit. this allows us, for example, to construct infinite families of polynomial continued fractions for famous constants like $\pi$ and $e$, $\zeta{(k)}$ (for each positive integer $k\geq 2$), various special functions evaluated at integral arguments and various algebraic numbers. we also pose several questions about the nature of the set of real numbers which have a polynomial continued fraction expansion."
