"a novel effective, secure and robust cdma digital image watermarking in yuv color space using dwt2. this paper is allocated to cdma digital images watermarking for ownership verification and image authentication applications, which for more security, watermark w is converted to a sequence and then a random binary sequence r of size n is adopted to encrypt the watermark; where n is the size of the watermark. this adopting process uses a pseudo-random number generator to determine the pixel to be used on a given key. after converting the host image to yuv color space and then wavelet decomposition of y channel, this adopted watermark is embedded into the selected subbands coefficients of y channel using the correlation properties of additive pseudo- random noise patterns. the experimental results show that the proposed approach provides extra imperceptibility, security and robustness against jpeg compression and different noises attacks compared to the similar proposed methods. moreover, the proposed approach has no need of the original image to extract watermarks."
"a comprehensive review on digital image watermarking. the advent of the internet led to the easy availability of digital data like images, audio, and video. easy access to multimedia gives rise to the issues such as content authentication, security, copyright protection, and ownership identification. here, we discuss the concept of digital image watermarking with a focus on the technique used in image watermark embedding and extraction of the watermark. the detailed classification along with the basic characteristics, namely visual imperceptibility, robustness, capacity, security of digital watermarking is also presented in this work. further, we have also discussed the recent application areas of digital watermarking such as healthcare, remote education, electronic voting systems, and the military. the robustness is evaluated by examining the effect of image processing attacks on the signed content and the watermark recoverability. the authors believe that the comprehensive survey presented in this paper will help the new researchers to gather knowledge in this domain. further, the comparative analysis can enkindle ideas to improve upon the already mentioned techniques."
"a robust image watermarking system based on deep neural networks. digital image watermarking is the process of embedding and extracting watermark covertly on a carrier image. incorporating deep learning networks with image watermarking has attracted increasing attention during recent years. however, existing deep learning-based watermarking systems cannot achieve robustness, blindness, and automated embedding and extraction simultaneously. in this paper, a fully automated image watermarking system based on deep neural networks is proposed to generalize the image watermarking processes. an unsupervised deep learning structure and a novel loss computation are proposed to achieve high capacity and high robustness without any prior knowledge of possible attacks. furthermore, a challenging application of watermark extraction from camera-captured images is provided to validate the practicality as well as the robustness of the proposed system. experimental results show the superiority performance of the proposed system as comparing against several currently available techniques."
