"algebraic non-integrability of magnetic billiards. we consider billiard ball motion in a convex domain of the euclidean plane bounded by a piece-wise smooth curve influenced by the constant magnetic field. we show that if there exists a polynomial in velocities integral of the magnetic billiard flow then every smooth piece $\gamma$ of the boundary must be algebraic and either is a circle or satisfies very strong restrictions. in particular in the case of ellipse it follows that magnetic billiard is algebraically not integrable for all magnitudes of the magnetic field. we conjecture that circle is the only integrable magnetic billiard not only in the algebraic sense, but for a broader meaning of integrability. we also introduce the model of outer magnetic billiards. as an application of our method we prove analogous results on algebraically integrable outer magnetic billiards."
"stability of periodic orbits in no-slip billiards. rigid bodies collision maps in dimension two, under a natural set of physical requirements, can be classified into two types: the standard specular reflection map and a second which we call, after broomhead and gutkin, no-slip. this leads to the study of no-slip billiards--planar billiard systems in which the moving particle is a disc (with rotationally symmetric mass distribution) whose translational and rotational velocities can both change at each collision with the boundary of the billiard domain. in this paper we greatly extend previous results on boundedness of orbits (broomhead and gutkin) and linear stability of periodic orbits for a sinai-type billiard (wojtkowski) for no-slip billiards. we show among other facts that: (i) for billiard domains in the plane having piecewise smooth boundary and at least one corner of inner angle less than $\pi$, no-slip billiard dynamics will always contain elliptic period-$2$ orbits; (ii) polygonal no-slip billiards always admit small invariant open sets and thus cannot be ergodic with respect to the canonical invariant billiard measure; (iii) the no-slip version of a sinai billiard must contain linearly stable periodic orbits of period $2$ and, more generally, we provide a curvature threshold at which a commonly occurring period-$2$ orbit shifts from being hyperbolic to being elliptic; (iv) finally, we make a number of observations concerning periodic orbits in a class of polygonal billiards."
"periodic orbits for square and rectangular billiards. mathematical billiards is much like the real game: a point mass, representing the ball, rolls in a straight line on a (perfectly friction-less) table, striking the sides according to the law of reflection. a billiard trajectory is then completely characterised by the number of elastic collisions. the rules of mathematical billiards may be simple, but the possible behaviours of billiard trajectories are endless. in fact, several fundamental theory questions in mathematics can be recast as billiards problems. a billiard trajectory is called a periodic orbit if the number of distinct collisions in the trajectory is finite. we classify all possible periodic orbits on square and rectangular tables. we show that periodic orbits on such billiard tables cannot have an odd number of distinct collisions. we also present a connection between the number of different classes of periodic orbits and euler's totient function, which for any integer $n$ counts how many integers smaller than $n$ share no common divisor with $n$ other than $1$. we explore how to construct periodic orbits with a prescribed (even) number of distinct collisions, and investigate properties of inadmissible (singular) trajectories, which are trajectories that eventually terminate at a vertex (a table corner)."
