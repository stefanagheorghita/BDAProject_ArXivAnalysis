"nonbinary stabilizer codes over finite fields. one formidable difficulty in quantum communication and computation is to protect information-carrying quantum states against undesired interactions with the environment. in past years, many good quantum error-correcting codes had been derived as binary stabilizer codes. fault-tolerant quantum computation prompted the study of nonbinary quantum codes, but the theory of such codes is not as advanced as that of binary quantum codes. this paper describes the basic theory of stabilizer codes over finite fields. the relation between stabilizer codes and general quantum codes is clarified by introducing a galois theory for these objects. a characterization of nonbinary stabilizer codes over gf(q) in terms of classical codes over gf(q^2) is provided that generalizes the well-known notion of additive codes over gf(4) of the binary case. this paper derives lower and upper bounds on the minimum distance of stabilizer codes, gives several code constructions, and derives numerous families of stabilizer codes, including quantum hamming codes, quadratic residue codes, quantum melas codes, quantum bch codes, and quantum character codes. the puncturing theory by rains is generalized to additive codes that are not necessarily pure. bounds on the maximal length of maximum distance separable stabilizer codes are given. a discussion of open problems concludes this paper."
"explicit error-correction scheme and code distance for bosonic codes with rotational symmetry. bosonic codes with rotational symmetry are currently one of the best performing quantum error correcting codes. little is known about error propagation and code distance for these rotation codes in contrast with qubit codes and bosonic codes with translation symmetry. we use a general purpose error basis that is naturally suited to codes with rotation symmetry to compute how errors propagate through gates. this error basis allows us to give an explicit error detection, decoding, and correction scheme for any code with rotation symmetry. we also prove that codes with an $n$-fold rotation symmetry have a distance of $(d_n, d_\theta)=(n, \pi/n)$ with respect to number and rotation errors."
"quantum stabilizer codes and beyond. the importance of quantum error correction in paving the way to build a practical quantum computer is no longer in doubt. this dissertation makes a threefold contribution to the mathematical theory of quantum error-correcting codes. firstly, it extends the framework of an important class of quantum codes -- nonbinary stabilizer codes. it clarifies the connections of stabilizer codes to classical codes over quadratic extension fields, provides many new constructions of quantum codes, and develops further the theory of optimal quantum codes and punctured quantum codes. secondly, it contributes to the theory of operator quantum error correcting codes also called as subsystem codes. these codes are expected to have efficient error recovery schemes than stabilizer codes. this dissertation develops a framework for study and analysis of subsystem codes using character theoretic methods. in particular, this work establishes a close link between subsystem codes and classical codes showing that the subsystem codes can be constructed from arbitrary classical codes. thirdly, it seeks to exploit the knowledge of noise to design efficient quantum codes and considers more realistic channels than the commonly studied depolarizing channel. it gives systematic constructions of asymmetric quantum stabilizer codes that exploit the asymmetry of errors in certain quantum channels."
