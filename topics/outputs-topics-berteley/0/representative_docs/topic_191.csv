"thermal corrections to entanglement entropy from holography. we use holographic techniques to calculate the first thermal correction to the entanglement entropy of a cap-like region of a cft defined on a sphere, successfully reproducing the field theory result. since this is an order-one correction to the entropy in the large-$n$ expansion, quantum corrections to the holographic entanglement entropy formula are essential. the bulk calculation is made tractable using the same technical machinery recently used to derive the linearized einstein equations in the bulk from the first law of entanglement entropy in the cft."
"towards a derivation of holographic entanglement entropy. we provide a derivation of holographic entanglement entropy for spherical entangling surfaces. our construction relies on conformally mapping the boundary cft to a hyperbolic geometry and observing that the vacuum state is mapped to a thermal state in the latter geometry. hence the conformal transformation maps the entanglement entropy to the thermodynamic entropy of this thermal state. the ads/cft dictionary allows us to calculate this thermodynamic entropy as the horizon entropy of a certain topological black hole. in even dimensions, we also demonstrate that the universal contribution to the entanglement entropy is given by a-type trace anomaly for any cft, without reference to holography."
"generalized entanglement entropy. we discuss two measures of entanglement in quantum field theory and their holographic realizations. for field theories admitting a global symmetry, we introduce a global symmetry entanglement entropy, associated with the partitioning of the symmetry group. this quantity is proposed to be related to the generalized holographic entanglement entropy defined via the partitioning of the internal space of the bulk geometry. the second measure of quantum field theory entanglement is the field space entanglement entropy, obtained by integrating out a subset of the quantum fields. we argue that field space entanglement entropy cannot be precisely realised geometrically in a holographic dual. however, for holographic geometries with interior decoupling regions, the differential entropy provides a close analogue to the field space entanglement entropy. we derive generic descriptions of such inner throat regions in terms of gravity coupled to massive scalars and show how the differential entropy in the throat captures features of the field space entanglement entropy."
