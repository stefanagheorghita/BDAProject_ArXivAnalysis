"a keypoint-based global association network for lane detection. lane detection is a challenging task that requires predicting complex topology shapes of lane lines and distinguishing different types of lanes simultaneously. earlier works follow a top-down roadmap to regress predefined anchors into various shapes of lane lines, which lacks enough flexibility to fit complex shapes of lanes due to the fixed anchor shapes. lately, some works propose to formulate lane detection as a keypoint estimation problem to describe the shapes of lane lines more flexibly and gradually group adjacent keypoints belonging to the same lane line in a point-by-point manner, which is inefficient and time-consuming during postprocessing. in this paper, we propose a global association network (ganet) to formulate the lane detection problem from a new perspective, where each keypoint is directly regressed to the starting point of the lane line instead of point-by-point extension. concretely, the association of keypoints to their belonged lane line is conducted by predicting their offsets to the corresponding starting points of lanes globally without dependence on each other, which could be done in parallel to greatly improve efficiency. in addition, we further propose a lane-aware feature aggregator (lfa), which adaptively captures the local correlations between adjacent keypoints to supplement local information to the global association. extensive experiments on two popular lane detection benchmarks show that our method outperforms previous methods with f1 score of 79.63% on culane and 97.71% on tusimple dataset with high fps. the code will be released at https://github.com/wolfwjs/ganet."
"prediction of lane number using results from lane detection. the lane number that the vehicle is traveling in is a key factor in intelligent vehicle fields. many lane detection algorithms were proposed and if we can perfectly detect the lanes, we can directly calculate the lane number from the lane detection results. however, in fact, lane detection algorithms sometimes underperform. therefore, we propose a new approach for predicting the lane number, where we combine the drive recorder image with the lane detection results to predict the lane number. experiments on our own dataset confirmed that our approach delivered outstanding results without significantly increasing computational cost."
"lanenet: real-time lane detection networks for autonomous driving. lane detection is to detect lanes on the road and provide the accurate location and shape of each lane. it severs as one of the key techniques to enable modern assisted and autonomous driving systems. however, several unique properties of lanes challenge the detection methods. the lack of distinctive features makes lane detection algorithms tend to be confused by other objects with similar local appearance. moreover, the inconsistent number of lanes on a road as well as diverse lane line patterns, e.g. solid, broken, single, double, merging, and splitting lines further hamper the performance. in this paper, we propose a deep neural network based method, named lanenet, to break down the lane detection into two stages: lane edge proposal and lane line localization. stage one uses a lane edge proposal network for pixel-wise lane edge classification, and the lane line localization network in stage two then detects lane lines based on lane edge proposals. please note that the goal of our lanenet is built to detect lane line only, which introduces more difficulties on suppressing the false detections on the similar lane marks on the road like arrows and characters. despite all the difficulties, our lane detection is shown to be robust to both highway and urban road scenarios method without relying on any assumptions on the lane number or the lane line patterns. the high running speed and low computational cost endow our lanenet the capability of being deployed on vehicle-based systems. experiments validate that our lanenet consistently delivers outstanding performances on real world traffic scenarios."
