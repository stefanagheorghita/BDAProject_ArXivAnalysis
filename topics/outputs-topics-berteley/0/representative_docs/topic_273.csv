"low-temperature magnetic ordering in srer$_2$o$_4$. srer$_2$o$_4$ has been characterised by low-temperature powder neutron diffraction, as well as single crystal specific heat and magnetisation measurements. magnetisation measurements show that the magnetic system is highly anisotropic at temperature above ordering. a magnetic field of 280 koe applied at $t=1.6$ k does not overcome the anisotropic magnetisation and fails to fully saturate the system. long range antiferromagnetic ordering develops below $t_n=0.75$ k, identified by magnetic bragg reflections with propagation vector ${\bf k}=0$ and a lambda anomaly in the specific heat. the magnetic structure consists of ferromagnetic chains running along the \textit{c} axis, two adjacent chains being stacked antiferromagnetically. the moments point along the \textit{c} direction, but only one of the two crystallographically in-equivalent er sites has a sizeable ordered magnetic moment, 4.5 $\rm \mu_b$ at 0.55 k. the magnetic properties of srer$_2$o$_4$ are discussed in terms of the interplay between the low-dimensionality, competing exchange interactions, dipolar interactions and low lying crystal field levels."
"incommensurate spiral spin order in camn$_2$bi$_2$ observed via high pressure neutron diffraction. high pressure neutron diffraction is employed to investigate the magnetic behavior of camn$_2$bi$_2$ in extreme conditions. in contrast to antiferromagnetic ordering on mn atoms reported at ambient pressure, our results reveal that at high pressure, incommensurate spiral spin order emerges due to the interplay between magnetism on the mn atoms and strong spin-orbit coupling on the bi atoms: sinusoidal spin order is observed at pressures as high as 7.4 gpa. competing antiferromagnetic order is observed at different temperatures in the partially frustrated lattice. this research provides a unique toolbox for conducting experimental magnetic and spin dynamics studies on magnetic quantum materials via high pressure neutron diffraction."
"nematic spin fluid in the tetragonal phase of bafe2as2. magnetic interactions are generally believed to play a key role in mediating electron pairing for superconductivity in iron arsenides; yet their character is only partially understood. experimentally, the antiferromagnetic (af) transition is always preceded by or coincident with a tetragonal to orthorhombic structural distortion. although it has been suggested that this lattice distortion is driven by an electronic nematic phase, where a spontaneously generated electronic liquid crystal state breaks the c4 rotational symmetry of the paramagnetic state, experimental evidence for electronic anisotropy has been either in the low-temperature orthorhombic phase or the tetragonal phase under uniaxial pressure that breaks this symmetry. here we use inelastic neutron scattering to demonstrate the presence of a large in-plane spin anisotropy above tn in the unstressed tetragonal phase of bafe2as2. in the low-temperature orthorhombic phase, we find highly anisotropic spin waves with a large damping along the af a-axis direction. on warming the system to the paramagnetic tetragonal phase, the low-energy spin waves evolve into quasi-elastic excitations, while the anisotropic spin excitations near the zone boundary persist. these results strongly suggest that the spin nematicity we find in the tetragonal phase of bafe2as2 is the source of the electronic and orbital anisotropy observed above tn by other probes, and has profound consequences for the physics of these materials."
