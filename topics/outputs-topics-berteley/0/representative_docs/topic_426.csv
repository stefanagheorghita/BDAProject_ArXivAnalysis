"weyl-lorentz-u(1)-invariant symmetric teleparallel gravity in three dimensions. we consider a weyl-lorentz-$u(1)$-invariant gravity model written in terms of a scalar field, electromagnetic field and nonmetricity without torsion and curvature, the so-called symmetric teleparallel geometry, in three dimensions. firstly, we obtain variational field equations from a lagrangian. then, we find some classes of circularly symmetric rotating solutions by making only a metric ansatz. the coincident gauge of symmetric teleparallel spacetime allows us for doing so."
"symmetric teleparallel geometries. in teleparallel gravity and, in particular, in $f(t)$ teleparallel gravity, there is a challenge in determining an appropriate (co-)frame and its corresponding spin connection to describe the geometry. very often, the ""proper"" frame, the frame in which all inertial effects are absent, is not the simplest (e.g, diagonal) (co-)frame. the determination of the frame and its corresponding spin connection for $f(t)$ teleparallel gravity theories when there exist affine symmetries is of much interest. in this paper we present the general form of the coframe and its corresponding spin connection for teleparallel geometries which are invariant under a $g_6$ group of affine symmetries. the proper coframe and the corresponding $f(t)$ field equations are also shown for these teleparallel robertson walker (trw) geometries. further, with the addition of an additional affine symmetry, it is possible to define a teleparallel de sitter (tds) geometry."
"teleparallel minkowski spacetime with perturbative approach for teleparallel gravity on a proper frame. a complete perturbation theory suitable for teleparallel gravity is developed. the proposed perturbation scheme takes into account perturbations of the coframe, the metric, and the spin-connection, while ensuring that the resulting perturbed system continues to describe a teleparallel gravity situation. the resulting perturbation scheme can be transformed to one in which perturbations all take place within the co-frame. a covariant definition of a teleparallel minkowski geometry is proposed. we compute the perturbed field equations for $f(t)$ teleparallel gravity and discuss the stability of the teleparallel minkowski geometry within $f(t)$ teleparallel gravity."
