information capacity of optical fiber channels with zero average dispersion. we study the statistics of optical data transmission in a noisy nonlinear fiber channel with a weak dispersion management and zero average dispersion. applying path integral methods we have found exactly the probability density functions of channel output both for a non-linear noisy channel and for a linear channel with additive and multiplicative noise. we have obtained analytically a lower bound estimate for the shannon capacity of considered nonlinear fiber channel.
"revisiting the nonlinear gaussian noise model: the case of hybrid fiber spans. we rederive from first principles and generalize the theoretical framework of the nonlinear gaussian noise model to the case of coherent optical systems with multiple fiber types per span and ideal nyquist spectra. we focus on the accurate numerical evaluation of the integral for the nonlinear noise variance for hybrid fiber spans. this task consists in addressing four computational aspects: (i) adopting a novel transformation of variables (other than using hyperbolic coordinates) that changes the integrand to a more appropriate form for numerical quadrature; (ii) evaluating analytically the integral at its lower limit, where the integrand presents a singularity; (iii) dividing the interval of integration into subintervals of size pi and approximating the integral in each subinterval by using various algorithms; and (iv) deriving an upper bound for the relative error when the interval of integration is truncated in order to accelerate computation. we apply the proposed model to coherent optical communications systems with hybrid fiber spans composed of quasi-singlemode fiber and single-mode fiber segments. the accuracy of the final analytical relationship for the nonlinear noise variance in long-haul coherent optical communications systems with hybrid fiber spans is checked using the split-step fourier method and monte carlo simulation. it is shown to be adequate to within 0.1 dbq for the determination of the optimal fiber segment lengths per span that maximize system performance."
"probabilistic shaping for nonlinearity tolerance. optimizing the input probability distribution of a discrete-time channel is a standard step in the information-theoretic analysis of digital communication systems. nevertheless, many practical communication systems transmit uniformly and independently distributed symbols drawn from regular constellation sets. the introduction of the probabilistic amplitude shaping architecture has renewed interest in using optimized probability distributions, i.e., probabilistic shaping. traditionally, probabilistic shaping has been employed to reduce the transmit power required for a given information rate over additive noise channels. while this translates into substantive performance gains for optical fiber communication systems, the interaction of shaping and fiber nonlinearity has posed intriguing questions. at first glance, probabilistic shaping seems to exacerbate nonlinear interference noise (nlin) due to larger higher-order standardized moments. therefore, the optimization of shaping distributions must differ from those used for linear channels. secondly, finite-length effects related to the memory of the nonlinear fiber channel have been observed. this suggests that the marginal input-symbol distribution is not the only consideration. this paper provides a tutorial-style discussion of probabilistic shaping for optical fiber communication. since the distinguishing property of the channel is the signal-dependent nlin, we speak of probabilistic shaping for nonlinearity tolerance. our analysis builds on the first-order time-domain perturbation approximation of the nonlinear fiber channel and revisits the notion of linear and nonlinear shaping gain. we largely focus on probabilistic amplitude shaping with popular shaping methods. the concept of shaping via sequence selection is given special consideration, as it inherently optimizes a multivariate distribution for shaped constellations."
