"an integrative data-driven physics-inspired approach to traffic congestion control. this paper offers an integrative data-driven physics-inspired approach to model and control traffic congestion in a resilient and efficient manner. while existing physics-based approaches commonly assign density and flow traffic states by using the fundamental diagram, this paper specifies the flow-density relation using past traffic information recorded in a time sliding window with a constant horizon length. with this approach, traffic coordination trends can be consistently learned and incorporated into traffic planning. this paper also models traffic coordination as a probabilistic process and obtains traffic feasibility conditions using linear temporal logic. model productive control (mpc) is applied to control traffic congestion through the boundary of the traffic network. therefore, the optimal boundary inflow is assigned as the solution of a constrained quadratic programming problem."
"virtual rings on highways: traffic control by connected automated vehicles. this work gives introduction to traffic control by connected automated vehicles. the influence of vehicle control on vehicular traffic and traffic control strategies are discussed and compared. it is highlighted that vehicle-to-everything connectivity allows connected automated vehicles to access the state of the traffic behind them such that feedback can be utilized to mitigate evolving congestions. numerical simulations demonstrate that such connectivity-based traffic control is beneficial for smoothness and energy efficiency of highway traffic. the dynamics and stability of traffic flow, under the proposed controllers, are analyzed in detail to construct stability charts that guide the selection of stabilizing control gains."
"empirical traffic data and their implications for traffic modeling. from single vehicle data a number of new empirical results about the temporal evolution, correlation, and density-dependence of macroscopic traffic quantities have been determined. these have relevant implications for traffic modeling and allow to test existing traffic models."
