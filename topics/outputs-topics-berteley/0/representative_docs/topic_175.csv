"surface and bulk criticality in midpoint percolation. the concept of midpoint percolation has recently been applied to characterize the double percolation transitions in negatively curved structures. regular $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattices are in the present work investigated using the same concept. specifically, the site-percolation transitions at the critical thresholds are investigated for dimensions up to $d=10$ by means of the leath algorithm. it is shown that the explicit inclusion of the boundaries provides a straightforward way to obtain critical indices, both for the bulk and surface parts. at and above the critical dimension $d=6$, it is found that the percolation cluster contains only a finite number of surface points in the infinite-size limit. this is in accordance with the expectation from studies of lattices with negative curvature. it is also found that the number of surface points, reached by the percolation cluster in the infinite limit, approaches 2d for large dimensions $d$. we also note that the size dependence in proliferation of percolating clusters for $d\ge 7$ can be obtained by solely counting surface points of the midpoint cluster."
"some toy models of self-organized criticality in percolation. we consider the bernoulli percolation model in a finite box and we introduce an automatic control of the percolation probability, which is a function of the percolation configuration. for a suitable choice of this automatic control, the model is self-critical, i.e., the percolation probability converges to the critical point $p_c$ when the size of the box tends to infinity. we study here three simple examples of such models, involving the size of the largest cluster, the number of vertices connected to the boundary of the box, or the distribution of the cluster sizes."
"percolation thresholds on high dimensional $d_n$ and dense packing lattices. the site and bond percolation problems are conventionally studied on (hyper)cubic lattices, which afford straightforward numerical treatments. the recent implementation of efficient simulation algorithms for high-dimensional systems now also facilitates the study of $d_n$ root lattices in $n$ dimension as well as $e_8$-related dense packing lattices. here, we consider the percolation problem on $d_n$ for $n=3$ to $13$ and on $e_8$ relatives for $n=6$ to 9. precise estimates for both site and bond percolation thresholds obtained from invasion percolation simulations are compared with dimensional series expansion on $d_n$ lattices based on lattice animal enumeration. as expected, the bond percolation threshold rapidly approaches the bethe lattice limit as $n$ increases for these high-connectivity lattices. corrections, however, exhibit clear yet unexplained trends. interestingly, the finite-size scaling exponent for invasion percolation is found to be lattice and percolation-type specific."
