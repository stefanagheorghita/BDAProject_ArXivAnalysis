"gauge fixing in the maxwell like gravitational theory in minkowski spacetime and in the equivalent lorentzian spacetime. in a previous paper we investigate a lagrangian field theory for the gravitational field (which is there represented by a section g^a of the orthonormal coframe bundle over minkowski spacetime. such theory, under appropriate conditions, has been proved to be equivalent to a lorentzian spacetime structure, where the metric tensor satisfies einstein field equations. here, we first recall that according to quantum field theory ideas gravitation is described by a lagrangian theory of a possible massive graviton field (generated by matter fields and coupling also to itself) living in minkowski spacetime. the graviton field is moreover supposed to be represented by a symmetric tensor field h carrying the representations of spin two and zero of the lorentz group. such a field, then (as it is well known), must necessarily satisfy the gauge condition given by eq.(3) below. next, we introduce an ansatz relating h to the 1-form fields g^a. then, using the clifford bundle formalism we derive, from our lagrangian theory, the exact wave equation for the graviton and investigate the role of the gauge condition given by eq.(3) in obtaining a reliable conservation law for the energy-momentum tensor of the gravitational plus the matter fields in minkowski spacetime. finally we ask the question: does eq.(3) fix any gauge condition for the field g of the effective lorentzian spacetime structure that represents the field h in our theory? we show that no gauge condition is fixed a priory, as is the case in general relativity. moreover we investigate under which conditions we may fix logunov gauge condition."
"geometrodynamics and lorentz symmetry. we study the dynamics of gauge theory and general relativity using fields of local observers, thus maintaining local lorentz symmetry despite a space/time splitting of fields. we start with yang--mills theory, where observer fields are defined as normalized future-timelike vector fields. we then define observers without a fixed geometry, and find these play two related roles in general relativity: splitting fields into spatial and temporal parts, and ""breaking"" gauge symmetry, effectively reducing the spacetime so(n,1) connection to an observer-dependent spatial so(n) connection. in both gauge theory and gravity, the observer field reduces the action to canonical form, without using gauge fixing. in the 4d gravity case, the result is a manifestly lorentz covariant counterpart of the ashtekar-barbero formulation. we also explain how this leads geometrically to a picture of general relativity in terms of ""observer space"" rather than spacetime---a setting where both spacetime symmetry and the dynamical description are simultaneously available."
"scalar-torsion theories of gravity i: general formalism and conformal transformations. we discuss the most general class of teleparallel scalar-torsion theories of gravity in their covariant formulation. the only restrictions we impose are the invariance of the action under diffeomorphisms and local lorentz transformations, as well as vanishing direct coupling of the matter fields to the teleparallel spin connection. in this general setting we discuss the implications of local lorentz invariance and diffeomorphism invariance and derive the general structure of the field equations. further, we show how different theories of this class are related to each other by conformal transformations of the tetrad and redefinitions of the scalar field. we finally show how the formalism can be generalized to an arbitrary number of scalar fields, and provide a few examples."
