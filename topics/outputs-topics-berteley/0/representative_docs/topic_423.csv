"the herschel virgo cluster survey: x.the relationship between cold dust and molecular gas content in virgo spirals. using the far-infrared emission, as observed by the herschel virgo cluster survey (hevics), and the integrated hi and co brightness, we infer the dust and total gas mass for a magnitude limited sample of 35 metal rich spiral galaxies in virgo. the co flux correlates tightly and linearly with far-infrared fluxes observed by herschel. molecules in these galaxies are more closely related to cold dust rather than to dust heated by star formation or to optical/nir brightness. we show that dust mass establishes a stronger correlation with the total gas mass than with the atomic or molecular component alone. the dust-to-gas ratio increases as the hi deficiency increases, but in highly hi deficient galaxies it stays constant. dust is in fact less affected than atomic gas by weak cluster interactions, which remove most of the hi gas from outer and high latitudes regions. highly disturbed galaxies, in a dense cluster environment, can instead loose a considerable fraction of gas and dust from the inner regions of the disk keeping constant the dust-to-gas ratio. there is evidence that the molecular phase is also quenched. this quencing becomes evident by considering the molecular gas mass per unit stellar mass. its amplitude, if confirmed by future studies, highlights that molecules are missing in virgo hi deficient spirals, but to a somewhat lesser extent than dust."
"cold gass, an iram legacy survey of molecular gas in massive galaxies: i. relations between h2, hi, stellar content and structural properties. we are conducting cold gass, a legacy survey for molecular gas in nearby galaxies. using the iram 30m telescope, we measure the co(1-0) line in a sample of ~350 nearby (d=100-200 mpc), massive galaxies (log(m*/msun)>10.0). the sample is selected purely according to stellar mass, and therefore provides an unbiased view of molecular gas in these systems. by combining the iram data with sdss photometry and spectroscopy, galex imaging and high-quality arecibo hi data, we investigate the partition of condensed baryons between stars, atomic gas and molecular gas in 0.1-10l* galaxies. in this paper, we present co luminosities and molecular hydrogen masses for the first 222 galaxies. the overall co detection rate is 54%, but our survey also uncovers the existence of sharp thresholds in galaxy structural parameters such as stellar mass surface density and concentration index, below which all galaxies have a measurable cold gas component but above which the detection rate of the co line drops suddenly. the mean molecular gas fraction mh2/m* of the co detections is 0.066+/-0.039, and this fraction does not depend on stellar mass, but is a strong function of nuv-r colour. through stacking, we set a firm upper limit of mh2/m*=0.0016+/-0.0005 for red galaxies with nuv-r>5.0. the average molecular-to-atomic hydrogen ratio in present-day galaxies is 0.3, with significant scatter from one galaxy to the next. the existence of strong detection thresholds in both the hi and co lines suggests that ""quenching"" processes have occurred in these systems. intriguingly, atomic gas strongly dominates in the minority of galaxies with significant cold gas that lie above these thresholds. this suggests that some re-accretion of gas may still be possible following the quenching event."
"nuclear starburst-driven evolution of the central region in ngc 6764. we study the co and the radiocontinuum emission in an active galaxy to analyze the interplay between the central activity and the molecular gas. we present new high-resolution observations of the co(1-0) and co(2-1) emission lines, and 3.5 cm and 20 cm radio continuum emission in the central region of the liner/starburst galaxy ngc 6764. the galaxy has an outflow morphology in radio continuum, spatially coincident with the co and h$\alpha$ emission, and centered slightly off the radio continuum peak at the liner nucleus. the total molecular gas mass in the center is about 7x10^8 \msun, using a co luminosity to total molecular gas conversion factor that is three times lower than the standard one. co(1-0) emission is found near the boundaries of the radio continuum emission cone. the outflow has a projected expansion velocity of 25 km/s relative to the systemic velocity of ngc6764. about 4x 10^6 \msun of molecular gas is detected in the outflow. the approximate location (~1 kpc) of the dynamical inner lindblad resonance has been derived from the rotation curve. the peak of the co emission is slightly (< 200 pc) offset from the peak of the radio continuum. the molecular gas has most likely been ejected by the stellar winds from the recent starburst, but the co line ratios show indication of an interaction with the agn. the energy released by the nuclear starburst is sufficient to explain the observed outflow, even if the data cannot exclude the agn from being the major energy source. comparison of the outflow with hydrodynamical simulations suggests that the nuclear starburst is 3--7 myr old and the bubble-like outflow is still confined and not freely expanding."
