"on equivalence relations sigma_1^1-definable over h(kappa). let kappa be an uncountable regular cardinal. call an equivalence relation on functions from kappa into 2 sigma_1^1-definable over h(kappa) if there is a first order sentence f and a parameter r subseteq h(kappa) such that functions f,g:kappa --> 2 are equivalent iff for some h:kappa --> 2, the structure (h(kappa),in,r,f,g,h) satisfies f, where in, r, f, g, and h are interpretations of the symbols appearing in f. all the values mu, 1 leq mu leq kappa^+ or mu=2^kappa, are possible numbers of equivalence classes for such a sigma_1^1-equivalence relation. additionally, the possibilities are closed under unions of <=kappa-many cardinals and products of <kappa-many cardinals. we prove that, consistent wise, these are the only restrictions under the singular cardinal hypothesis. the result is that the possible numbers of equivalence classes of sigma_1^1-equivalence relations might consistent wise be exactly those cardinals which are in a prearranged set, provided that the singular cardinal hypothesis holds and that some necessary conditions are fulfilled."
"the tree property at double successors of singular cardinals of uncountable cofinality. assuming the existence of a strong cardinal $\kappa$ and a measurable cardinal above it, we force a generic extension in which $\kappa$ is a singular strong limit cardinal of any prescribed cofinality, and such that the tree property holds at $\kappa^{++}$."
"easton's theorem in the presence of woodin cardinals. under the assumption that $\delta$ is a woodin cardinal and $\gch$ holds, i show that if $f$ is any class function from the regular cardinals to the cardinals such that (1) $\kappa<\cf(f(\kappa))$, (2) $\kappa<\lambda$ implies $f(\kappa)\leq f(\lambda)$, and (3) $\delta$ is closed under $f$, then there is a cofinality-preserving forcing extension in which $2^\gamma= f(\gamma)$ for each regular cardinal $\gamma<\delta$, and in which $\delta$ remains woodin. unlike the analogous results for supercompact cardinals [men76] and strong cardinals [fh08], there is no requirement that the function $f$ be locally definable."
