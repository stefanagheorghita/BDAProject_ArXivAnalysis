"symplectic capacities of toric manifolds and related results. in this paper we give concrete estimations for the pseudo symplectic capacities of toric manifolds in combinatorial data. some examples are given to show that our estimates can compute their pseudo symplectic capacities. as applications we also estimate the symplectic capacities of the polygon spaces. other related results are impacts of symplectic blow-up on symplectic capacities, symplectic packings in symplectic toric manifolds, the seshadri constant of an ample line bundle on toric manifolds, and symplectic capacities of symplectic manifolds with $s^1$-action."
stability and existence of surfaces in symplectic 4-manifolds with $b^+=1$. we establish various stability results for symplectic surfaces in symplectic $4-$manifolds with $b^+=1$. these results are then applied to prove the existence of representatives of lagrangian ade-configurations as well as to classify negative symplectic spheres in symplectic $4-$manifolds with $\kappa=-\infty$. this involves the explicit construction of spheres in rational manifolds via a new construction technique called the tilted transport.
"symplectic actions of non-hamiltonian type. hamiltonian symplectic actions of tori on compact symplectic manifolds have been extensively studied in the past thirty years, and a number of classifications have been achieved, for instance in the case that the acting torus is $n$-dimensional and the symplectic manifold is $2n$-dimensional. in this case the $n$-dimensional orbits are lagrangian, so it is natural to wonder whether there are interesting classes of symplectic actions with lagrangian orbits, and that are not hamiltonian. it turns out that there are many such classes which contain for example the kodaira variety, and which can be classified in terms of symplectic invariants. the paper reviews several classifications, which include symplectic actions having a lagrangian orbit or a symplectic orbit of maximal dimension. we make an emphasis on the construction of the symplectic invariants, and their computation in examples."
