"a klain-schneider theorem for vector-valued valuations on convex functions. a functional analog of the klain-schneider theorem for vector-valued valuations on convex functions is established, providing a classification of continuous, translation covariant, simple valuations. under additional rotation equivariance assumptions, an analytic counterpart of the moment vector is characterized alongside a new epi-translation invariant valuation. the former arises as the top-degree operator in a family of functional intrinsic moments, which are linked to functional intrinsic volumes through translations. the latter represents the top-degree operator in a class of minkowski vectors, which are introduced in this article and which lack classical counterparts on convex bodies, as they vanish due to the minkowski relations. additional classification results are obtained for homogeneous valuations of extremal degrees."
"blaschke-santal\'o inequalities for minkowski and asplund endomorphisms. it is shown that each monotone minkowski endomorphism of convex bodies gives rise to an isoperimetric inequality which directly implies the classical urysohn inequality. among this large family of new inequalities, the only affine invariant one - the blaschke-santal\'o inequality - turns out to be the strongest one. a further extension of these inequalities to merely weakly monotone minkowski endomorphisms is proven to be impossible. moreover, for functional analogues of monotone minkowski endomorphisms, a family of analytic inequalities for log-concave functions is established which generalizes the functional blaschke-santal\'o inequality."
"a new class of operator monotone functions via operator means. in this paper, we obtain a new class of functions, which is developed via the hermite--hadamard inequality for convex functions. the well-known one-one correspondence between the class of operator monotone functions and operator connections declares that the obtained class represents the weighted logarithmic means. we shall also consider weighted identric mean and some relationships between various operator means. among many things, we extended the weighted arithmetic--geometric operator mean inequality as $a\#_{t}b\leq a\ell_t b\leq \frac{1}{2}(a\#_{t}b + a\nabla_{t} b)\le a\nabla_tb$ and $a\#_{t}b\leq a\mathcal{i}_t b\leq a\nabla_{t} b$ involving the considered operator means."
