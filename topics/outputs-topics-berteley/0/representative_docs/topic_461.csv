"koopman analysis of burgers equation. the emergence of dynamic mode decomposition (dmd) as a practical way to attempt a koopman mode decomposition of a nonlinear pde presents exciting prospects for identifying invariant sets and slowly decaying transient structures buried in the pde dynamics. however, there are many subtleties in connecting dmd to koopman analysis and it remains unclear how realistic koopman analysis is for complex systems such as the navier-stokes equations. with this as motivation, we present here a full koopman decomposition for the velocity field in burgers equation by deriving explicit expressions for the koopman modes and eigenfunctions - the first time this has been done for a nonlinear pde. the decomposition highlights the fact that different observables can require different subsets of koopman eigenfunctions to express them and presents a nice example where: (i) the koopman modes are linearly dependent and so cannot be fit a posteriori to snapshots of the flow without knowledge of the koopman eigenfunctions; and (ii) the koopman eigenvalues are highly degenerate which means that computed koopman modes become initial-condition dependent. as way of illustration, we discuss the form of the koopman expansion with various initial conditions and assess the capability of dmd to extract the decaying nonlinear coherent structures in run-down simulations."
"a data-driven approximation of the koopman operator: extending dynamic mode decomposition. the koopman operator is a linear but infinite dimensional operator that governs the evolution of scalar observables defined on the state space of an autonomous dynamical system, and is a powerful tool for the analysis and decomposition of nonlinear dynamical systems. in this manuscript, we present a data driven method for approximating the leading eigenvalues, eigenfunctions, and modes of the koopman operator. the method requires a data set of snapshot pairs and a dictionary of scalar observables, but does not require explicit governing equations or interaction with a ""black box"" integrator. we will show that this approach is, in effect, an extension of dynamic mode decomposition (dmd), which has been used to approximate the koopman eigenvalues and modes. furthermore, if the data provided to the method are generated by a markov process instead of a deterministic dynamical system, the algorithm approximates the eigenfunctions of the kolmogorov backward equation, which could be considered as the ""stochastic koopman operator"" [1]. finally, four illustrative examples are presented: two that highlight the quantitative performance of the method when presented with either deterministic or stochastic data, and two that show potential applications of the koopman eigenfunctions."
"koopman operator theory for nonlinear dynamic modeling using dynamic mode decomposition. the koopman operator is a linear operator that describes the evolution of scalar observables (i.e., measurement functions of the states) in an infinitedimensional hilbert space. this operator theoretic point of view lifts the dynamics of a finite-dimensional nonlinear system to an infinite-dimensional function space where the evolution of the original system becomes linear. in this paper, we provide a brief summary of the koopman operator theorem for nonlinear dynamics modeling and focus on analyzing several data-driven implementations using dynamical mode decomposition (dmd) for autonomous and controlled canonical problems. we apply the extended dynamic mode decomposition (edmd) to identify the leading koopman eigenfunctions and approximate a finite-dimensional representation of the discovered linear dynamics. this allows us to apply linear control approaches towards nonlinear systems without linearization approximations around fixed points. we can then examine the fidelity of using a linear controller based on a koopman operator approximated system on under-actuated systems with basic maneuvers. we demonstrate the effectiveness of this theory through numerical simulation on two classic dynamical systems are used to show dmd methods of evaluating and approximating the koopman operator and its effectiveness at linearizing these systems."
