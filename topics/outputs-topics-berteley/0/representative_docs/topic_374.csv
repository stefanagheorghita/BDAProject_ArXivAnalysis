"on the use of large language models to generate capability ontologies. capability ontologies are increasingly used to model functionalities of systems or machines. the creation of such ontological models with all properties and constraints of capabilities is very complex and can only be done by ontology experts. however, large language models (llms) have shown that they can generate machine-interpretable models from natural language text input and thus support engineers / ontology experts. therefore, this paper investigates how llms can be used to create capability ontologies. we present a study with a series of experiments in which capabilities with varying complexities are generated using different prompting techniques and with different llms. errors in the generated ontologies are recorded and compared. to analyze the quality of the generated ontologies, a semi-automated approach based on rdf syntax checking, owl reasoning, and shacl constraints is used. the results of this study are very promising because even for complex capabilities, the generated ontologies are almost free of errors."
"uncertainty in automated ontology matching: lessons learned from an empirical experimentation. data integration is considered a classic research field and a pressing need within the information science community. ontologies play a critical role in such a process by providing well-consolidated support to link and semantically integrate datasets via interoperability. this paper approaches data integration from an application perspective, looking at techniques based on ontology matching. an ontology-based process may only be considered adequate by assuming manual matching of different sources of information. however, since the approach becomes unrealistic once the system scales up, automation of the matching process becomes a compelling need. therefore, we have conducted experiments on actual data with the support of existing tools for automatic ontology matching from the scientific community. even considering a relatively simple case study (i.e., the spatio-temporal alignment of global indicators), outcomes clearly show significant uncertainty resulting from errors and inaccuracies along the automated matching process. more concretely, this paper aims to test on real-world data a bottom-up knowledge-building approach, discuss the lessons learned from the experimental results of the case study, and draw conclusions about uncertainty and uncertainty management in an automated ontology matching process. while the most common evaluation metrics clearly demonstrate the unreliability of fully automated matching solutions, properly designed semi-supervised approaches seem to be mature for a more generalized application."
"ontology service center: a datahub for ontology application. with the growth of data-oriented research in humanities, a large number of research datasets have been created and published through web services. however, how to discover, integrate and reuse these distributed heterogeneous research datasets is a challenging task. ontology is the soul between series digital humanities resources, which provides a good way for people to discover and understand these datasets. with the release of more and more linked open data and knowledge bases, a large number of ontologies have been produced at the same time. these ontologies have different publishing formats, consumption patterns, and interactions ways, which are not conductive to the users understanding of the datasets and the reuse of the ontologies. the ontology service center platform consists of ontology query center and ontology validation center, mainly using linked data and ontology-based technologies. the ontology query center realizes the functions of ontology publishing, querying, data interaction and online browsing, while the ontology validation center can verify the status of using certain ontologies in the linked datasets. the empirical part of the paper uses the confucius portrait as an example of how osc can be used in the semantic annotation of images. in a word, the purpose of this paper is to construct the applied ecology of ontology to promote the development of knowledge graphs and the spread of ontology."
