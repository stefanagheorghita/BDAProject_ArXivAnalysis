"the mass profile and dynamical status of the z~0.8 galaxy cluster lcdcs 0504. constraints on the mass distribution in high-redshift clusters of galaxies are not currently very strong. we aim to constrain the mass profile, m(r), and dynamical status of the $z \sim 0.8$ lcdcs 0504 cluster of galaxies characterized by prominent giant gravitational arcs near its center. our analysis is based on deep x-ray, optical, and infrared imaging, as well as optical spectroscopy. we model the mass distribution of the cluster with three different mass density profiles, whose parameters are constrained by the strong lensing features of the inner cluster region, by the x-ray emission from the intra-cluster medium, and by the kinematics of 71 cluster members. we obtain consistent m(r) determinations from three methods (dispersion-kurtosis, caustics and mamposst), out to the cluster virial radius and beyond. the mass profile inferred by the strong lensing analysis in the central cluster region is slightly above, but still consistent with, the kinematics estimate. on the other hand, the x-ray based m(r) is significantly below both the kinematics and strong lensing estimates. theoretical predictions from $\lambda$cdm cosmology for the concentration--mass relation are in agreement with our observational results, when taking into account the uncertainties in both the observational and theoretical estimates. there appears to be a central deficit in the intra-cluster gas mass fraction compared to nearby clusters. despite the relaxed appearance of this cluster, the determinations of its mass profile by different probes show substantial discrepancies, the origin of which remains to be determined. the extension of a similar dynamical analysis to other clusters of the daft/fada survey will allow to shed light on the possible systematics that affect the determination of mass profiles of high-z clusters, possibly related to our incomplete understanding of intracluster baryon physics."
"the matter distribution in z ~ 0.5 redshift clusters of galaxies. ii : the link between dark and visible matter. we present an optical analysis of a sample of 11 clusters built from the excpres sample of x-ray selected clusters at intermediate redshift (z ~ 0.5). with a careful selection of the background galaxies we provide the mass maps reconstructed from the weak lensing by the clusters. we compare them with the light distribution traced by the early-type galaxies selected along the red sequence for each cluster. the strong correlations between dark matter and galaxy distributions are confirmed, although some discrepancies arise, mostly for merging or perturbed clusters. the average m/l ratio of the clusters is found to be: m/l_r = 160 +/- 60 in solar units (with no evolutionary correction), in excellent agreement with similar previous studies. no strong evolutionary effects are identified even if the small sample size reduces the significance of the result. we also provide a individual analysis of each cluster in the sample with a comparison between the dark matter, the galaxies and the gas distributions. some of the clusters are studied for the first time in the optical."
"the stellar mass fraction and baryon content of galaxy clusters and groups. [abridged] the analysis of a sample of 52 clusters with precise and hypothesis-parsimonious measurements of mass shows that low mass clusters and groups are not simple scaled-down versions of their massive cousins in terms of stellar content: lighter clusters have more stars per unit cluster mass. the same analysis also shows that the stellar content of clusters and groups displays an intrinsic spread at a given cluster mass, i.e. clusters are not similar each other in the amount of stars they contain, not even at a fixed cluster mass. the stellar mass fraction depends on halo mass with (logarithmic) slope -0.55+/-0.08 and with 0.15+/-0.02 dex of intrinsic scatter at a fixed cluster mass. the intrinsic scatter at a fixed cluster mass we determine for gas mass fractions is smaller, 0.06+/-0.01 dex. the intrinsic scatter in both the stellar and gas mass fractions is a distinctive signature that the regions from which clusters and groups collected matter, a few tens of mpc, are yet not representative, in terms of gas and baryon content, of the mean matter content of the universe. the observed stellar mass fraction values are in marked disagreement with gasdynamics simulations with cooling and star formation of clusters and groups. we found the the baryon (gas+stellar) fraction is fairly constant for clusters and groups with 13.7<lg(mass)<15.0 solar masses and it is offset from the wmap-derived value by about 6 sigmas. the offset could be related to the possible non universality of the baryon fraction pointed out by our measurements of the intrinsic scatter. our analysis is the first that does not assume that clusters are identically equal at a given halo mass and it is also more accurate in many aspects. the data and code used for the stochastic computation are distributed with the paper."
