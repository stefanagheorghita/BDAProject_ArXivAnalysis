"axion forces in axion backgrounds. axions can naturally be very light due to the protection of an (approximate) shift symmetry. because of their pseudoscalar nature, the long-range force mediated by the axion at tree level is spin dependent, which cannot lead to observable effects between two unpolarized macroscopic objects. at the one-loop level, however, the exchange of two axions does mediate a spin-independent force. this force is coherently enhanced in the presence of an axion background. in this work, we study the two-axion exchange force in a generic axion background. we find that the breaking of the axion shift symmetry plays a crucial role in determining this force. the background-induced axion force $v_{\rm bkg}$ vanishes in the shift-symmetry restoration limit. the shift symmetry can be broken either explicitly by non-perturbative effects or effectively by the axion background. when the shift symmetry is broken, $v_{\rm bkg}$ scales as $1/r$ and could be further enhanced by a large occupation number of the background axions. we investigate possible experimental probes of this effect in two distinct scenarios: an axion dark matter background and a solar axion flux, using fifth-force searches and atomic spectroscopy experiments. in the axion dark matter case, we find that the background-induced axion force can place strong constraints on axion couplings and masses, comparable to existing astrophysical bounds."
"exploring quantum aspects of dark matter axions and dark photons transitioning to photons in a resonant cavity. when axion cold dark matter interacts with a static magnetic field, it can be converted to photons with energy near the axion's mass. classical analysis shows that incorporating a resonant cavity significantly enhances this conversion rate, forming the basis for many experiments aimed at detecting dark matter axions. however, one might ask: does the axion-photon conversion rate increase for a single axion-photon transition? answering this question could lead to optimizing the search for axions by integrating quantum measurement techniques. in this paper, we demonstrate that at the quantum level, single axion-photon transitions are amplified by the cavity quality factor $q$. furthermore, the coherence of dark matter waves is unnecessary during the measurement. the underlying principle is similar to the purcell effect. additionally, we provide an analysis of the scenario involving dark photon dark matter."
"a new experimental approach to probe qcd axion dark matter in the mass range above 40$\mu$ev. the axion emerges in extensions of the standard model that explain the absence of cp violation in the strong interactions. simultaneously, it can provide naturally the cold dark matter in our universe. several searches for axions and axion-like particles (alps) have constrained the corresponding parameter space over the last decades but no unambiguous hints of their existence have been found. the axion mass range below 1 mev remains highly attractive and a well motivated region for dark matter axions. in this white paper we present a description of a new experiment based on the concept of a dielectric haloscope for the direct search of dark matter axions in the mass range of 40 to 400 $\mu$ev. this magnetized disk and mirror axion experiment (madmax) will consist of several parallel dielectric disks, which are placed in a strong magnetic field and with adjustable separations. this setting is expected to allow for an observable emission of axion induced electromagnetic waves at a frequency between 10 to 100 ghz corresponding to the axion mass."
