"graph sharing games: complexity and connectivity. we study the following combinatorial game played by two players, alice and bob, which generalizes the pizza game considered by brown, winkler and others. given a connected graph g with nonnegative weights assigned to its vertices, the players alternately take one vertex of g in each turn. the first turn is alice's. the vertices are to be taken according to one (or both) of the following two rules: (t) the subgraph of g induced by the taken vertices is connected during the whole game, (r) the subgraph of g induced by the remaining vertices is connected during the whole game. we show that if rules (t) and/or (r) are required then for every epsilon > 0 and for every positive integer k there is a k-connected graph g for which bob has a strategy to obtain (1-epsilon) of the total weight of the vertices. this contrasts with the original pizza game played on a cycle, where alice is known to have a strategy to obtain 4/9 of the total weight. we show that the problem of deciding whether alice has a winning strategy (i.e., a strategy to obtain more than half of the total weight) is pspace-complete if condition (r) or both conditions (t) and (r) are required. we also consider a game played on connected graphs (without weights) where the first player who violates condition (t) or (r) loses the game. we show that deciding who has the winning strategy is pspace-complete."
"combinatorial analysis of a subtraction game on graphs. we define a two-player combinatorial game in which players take alternate turns; each turn consists on deleting a vertex of a graph, together with all the edges containing such vertex. if any vertex became isolated by a player's move then it would also be deleted. a player wins the game when the other player has no moves available. we study this game under various viewpoints: by finding specific strategies for certain families of graphs, through using properties of a graph's automorphism group, by writing a program to look at sprague-grundy numbers, and by studying the game when played on random graphs. when analyzing grim played on paths, using the sprague-grundy function, we find a connection to a standing open question about octal games."
"positional games on random graphs. we introduce and study maker/breaker-type positional games on random graphs. our main concern is to determine the threshold probability $p_{f}$ for the existence of maker's strategy to claim a member of $f$ in the unbiased game played on the edges of random graph $g(n,p)$, for various target families $f$ of winning sets. more generally, for each probability above this threshold we study the smallest bias $b$ such that maker wins the $(1\:b)$ biased game. we investigate these functions for a number of basic games, like the connectivity game, the perfect matching game, the clique game and the hamiltonian cycle game."
