"deep time-frequency representation and progressive decision fusion for ecg classification. early recognition of abnormal rhythms in ecg signals is crucial for monitoring and diagnosing patients' cardiac conditions, increasing the success rate of the treatment. classifying abnormal rhythms into exact categories is very challenging due to the broad taxonomy of rhythms, noises and lack of large-scale real-world annotated data. different from previous methods that utilize hand-crafted features or learn features from the original signal domain, we propose a novel ecg classification method by learning deep time-frequency representation and progressive decision fusion at different temporal scales in an end-to-end manner. first, the ecg wave signal is transformed into the time-frequency domain by using the short-time fourier transform. next, several scale-specific deep convolutional neural networks are trained on ecg samples of a specific length. finally, a progressive online decision fusion method is proposed to fuse decisions from the scale-specific models into a more accurate and stable one. extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world ecg datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method."
"opportunities and challenges of deep learning methods for electrocardiogram data: a systematic review. background:the electrocardiogram (ecg) is one of the most commonly used diagnostic tools in medicine and healthcare. deep learning methods have achieved promising results on predictive healthcare tasks using ecg signals. objective:this paper presents a systematic review of deep learning methods for ecg data from both modeling and application perspectives. methods:we extracted papers that applied deep learning (deep neural network) models to ecg data that were published between jan. 1st of 2010 and feb. 29th of 2020 from google scholar, pubmed, and the dblp. we then analyzed each article according to three factors: tasks, models, and data. finally, we discuss open challenges and unsolved problems in this area. results: the total number of papers extracted was 191. among these papers, 108 were published after 2019. different deep learning architectures have been used in various ecg analytics tasks, such as disease detection/classification, annotation/localization, sleep staging, biometric human identification, and denoising. conclusion: the number of works on deep learning for ecg data has grown explosively in recent years. such works have achieved accuracy comparable to that of traditional feature-based approaches and ensembles of multiple approaches can achieve even better results. specifically, we found that a hybrid architecture of a convolutional neural network and recurrent neural network ensemble using expert features yields the best results. however, there are some new challenges and problems related to interpretability, scalability, and efficiency that must be addressed. furthermore, it is also worth investigating new applications from the perspectives of datasets and methods. significance: this paper summarizes existing deep learning research using ecg data from multiple perspectives and highlights existing challenges and problems to identify potential future research directions."
"an electrocardiogram multi-task benchmark with comprehensive evaluations and insightful findings. in the process of patient diagnosis, non-invasive measurements are widely used due to their low risks and quick results. electrocardiogram (ecg), as a non-invasive method to collect heart activities, is used to diagnose cardiac conditions. analyzing the ecg typically requires domain expertise, which is a roadblock to applying artificial intelligence (ai) for healthcare. through advances in self-supervised learning and foundation models, ai systems can now acquire and leverage domain knowledge without relying solely on human expertise. however, there is a lack of comprehensive analyses over the foundation models' performance on ecg. this study aims to answer the research question: ""are foundation models useful for ecg analysis?"" to address it, we evaluate language/general time-series/ecg foundation models in comparison with time-series deep learning models. the experimental results show that general time-series/ecg foundation models achieve a top performance rate of 80%, indicating their effectiveness in ecg analysis. in-depth analyses and insights are provided along with comprehensive experimental results. this study highlights the limitations and potential of foundation models in advancing physiological waveform analysis. the data and code for this benchmark are publicly available at https://github.com/yuhaoxu99/ecgmultitasks-benchmark."
