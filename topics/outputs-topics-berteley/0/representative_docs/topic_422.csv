"secondary electron topographical contrast formation in scanning transmission electron microscopy. secondary electron (se) imaging offers a powerful complementary capabilities to conventional scanning transmission electron microscopy (stem) by providing surface-sensitive, pseudo-3d topographic information. however, contrast interpretation of such images remains empirical due to complex interactions of emitted se with the magnetic field in the objective field of tem. here, we propose an analytical physical model that takes into account the physics of se emission and interaction of the emitted ses with magnetic field. this enables more reliable image interpretation and potentially lay the foundation for novel 3d surface reconstruction algorithms."
"multi-exposure diffraction pattern fusion applied to enable wider-angle transmission kikuchi diffraction with direct electron detectors. diffraction pattern analysis can be used to reveal the crystalline structure of materials, and this information is used to nano- and micro-structure of advanced engineering materials that enable modern life. for nano-structured materials typically diffraction pattern analysis is performed in the transmission electron microscope (tem) and tem diffraction patterns typically have a limited angular range (less than a few degrees) due to the long camera length, and this requires analysis of multiple patterns to probe a unit cell. as a different approach, wide angle kikuchi patterns can be captured using an on-axis detector in the scanning electron microscope (sem) with a shorter camera length. these 'transmission kikuchi diffraction' (tkd) patterns present a direct projection of the unit cell and can be routinely analyzed using ebsd-based methods and dynamical diffraction theory. in the present work, we enhance this analysis significantly and present a multi-exposure diffraction pattern fusion method that increases the dynamic range of the detected patterns captured with a timepix3-based direct electron detector (ded). this method uses an easy-to-apply exposure fusion routine to collect data and extend the dynamic range, as well as normalize the intensity distribution within these very wide (>95{\deg}) angle patterns. the potential of this method is demonstrated with full diffraction sphere reprojection and highlight potential of the approach to rapidly probe the structure of nano-structured materials in the scanning electron microscope."
"forescattered electron imaging of nanoparticles in a scanning electron microscopy. in this study, we have used a zr-nb alloy containing well-defined nano-precipitates as a model material in which to study imaging contrast inversions (atomic number or diffraction contrast) observed with the forescattered electron imaging system, argustm, in a scanning electron microscope (sem) when imaging a thin foil in a transmission geometry. the study is based on monte carlo simulations and analysis of micrographs experimentally acquired under different imaging conditions. based on the results, imaging conditions that enhance atomic number or diffraction contrast have been proposed. data acquired from the argustm imaging system in sem has also been compared with results from standard transmission electron microscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy imaging of the same material. these results demonstrate the capability of the argustm system to investigate microstructures in nano-scale materials."
