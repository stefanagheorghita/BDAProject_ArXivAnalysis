"drastic changes before the 2011 tohoku earthquake, revealed by exploratory data analysis. predicting earthquakes is of the utmost importance, especially to those countries of high risk, and although much effort has been made, it has yet to be realised. nevertheless, there is a paucity of statistical approaches in seismic studies to the extent that an old theory is believed without verification. seismic records of time and magnitude in japan were analysed by exploratory data analysis (eda). eda is a parametric statistical approach based on the characteristics of data and is suitable for data-driven investigations. the distribution style of each dataset was determined, and the important parameters were found. this enabled us to identify and evaluate the anomalies in the data. before the huge 2011 tohoku earthquake, swarm earthquakes occurred before the main earthquake at improbable frequencies. the frequency and magnitude of all earthquakes increased. both changes made larger earthquakes more likely to occur: even an m9 earthquake was expected every two years. from these simple measurements, the eda succeeded in extracting useful information. detecting and evaluating anomalies using this approach for every set of data would lead to a more accurate prediction of earthquakes."
"mapping finite-fault slip with spatial correlation between seismicity and point-source coulomb failure stress change. most earthquake energy release arises during fault slip many kilometers below the earth's surface. understanding earthquakes and their hazard requires mapping the geometry and distribution of this slip. such finite-fault maps are typically derived from surface phenomena, such as seismic and geodetic ground motions. here we introduce an imaging procedure for mapping finite-fault slip directly from seismicity and aftershocks - phenomena occurring at depth around an earthquake rupture. for specified source and receiver faults, we map source-fault slip in 3d by correlation of point-source coulomb failure stress change (${\delta}$cfs) kernels across the distribution of seismicity around an earthquake. these seismicity-stress maps show relative, static fault slip compatible with the surrounding seismicity given the physics of ${\delta}$cfs; they can aid other slip inversions and aftershock forecasting, and be obtained for early instrumental earthquakes. we verify this procedure recovers synthetic fault slip, and matches independent estimates of slip for the 2004 mw 6.0 parkfield and 2021 mw 6.0 antelope valley california earthquakes. for the 2018 mw 7.1 anchorage alaska intra-slab earthquake, seismicity-stress maps, combined with multi-scale precise hypocenter relocation, resolve the enigma of which mainshock faulting plane ruptured (the gently east-dipping plane), and clarify slab structures activated in the energetic aftershock sequence."
"pre-earthquake state identification by micro-earthquake spike trains dissimilarity analysis. the exact mechanisms leading to an earthquake are not fully understood and the space-time structural features are non-trivial. previous studies suggest the seismicity of very low intensity earthquakes, known as micro-earthquakes, may contain information about the source process before major earthquakes, as they can quantify modifications to stress or strain across time that finally lead to a major earthquake. this work uses the history of seismic activity of micro-earthquakes to analyze the spatio-temporal statistical independence among the monitoring stations of a seismic network. using point process distance measures applied to the micro-earthquakes' spike trains recorded in these stations, a pre-earthquake state is defined statistically with the aim of finding a relation between the level of dissimilarity among stations' readings and the future occurrence of larger earthquakes in the region. this paper also addresses the compatibility of this statistical approach with the burridge-knopoff spring-block physical model for earthquakes. based on the results, there is evidence for an earthquake precursory state associated with an increase in spike train dissimilarity as evaluated by a statistical surrogate test."
