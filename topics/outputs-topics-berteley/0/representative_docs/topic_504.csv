regularized transformation-optics cloaking for the helmholtz equation: from partial cloak to full cloak. we develop a very general theory on the regularized approximate invisibility cloaking for the wave scattering governed by the helmholtz equation in any space dimensions via the approach of transformation optics.
"full-wave finite-difference time-domain simulation of electromagnetic cloaking structures. this paper proposes a radial dependent dispersive finite-difference time-domain method for the modelling of electromagnetic cloaking structures. the permittivity and permeability of the cloak are mapped to the drude dispersion model and taken into account in dispersive fdtd simulations. numerical simulations demonstrate that under ideal conditions, objects placed inside the cloak are `invisible' to external electromagnetic fields. however for the simplified cloak based on linear transformations, the back scattering has a similar level to the case of a pec cylinder without any cloak, rendering the object still being `visible'. it is also demonstrated numerically that the simplified cloak based on high-order transformations can indeed improve the cloaking performance."
"making waves round a structured cloak: lattices, negative refraction and fringes. using the framework of transformation optics, this paper presents a detailed analysis of a non-singular square cloak for acoustic, out-of-plane shear elastic, and electromagnetic waves. the generating map is examined in detail and linked to the material properties of the cloak. analysis of wave propagation through the cloak is presented and accompanied by numerical illustrations. the efficacy of the regularised cloak is demonstrated and an objective numerical measure of the quality of the cloaking effect is provided. it is demonstrated that the cloaking effect persists over a wide range of frequencies. as a demonstration of the effectiveness of the regularised cloak, a young's double slit experiment is presented. the stability of the interference pattern is examined when a cloaked and uncloaked obstacle are successively placed in front of one of the apertures. this novel link with a well-known quantum mechanical experiment provides an additional method through which the quality of cloaks may be examined. in the second half of the paper, it is shown that an approximate cloak may be constructed using a discrete lattice structure. the geometry and material properties of the lattice are derived from the continuum cloak. the efficiency of the approximate lattice cloak is analysed and a series of illustrative simulations presented. it is demonstrated that effective cloaking may be obtained by using a relatively simple lattice structure, particularly in the low frequency regime."
