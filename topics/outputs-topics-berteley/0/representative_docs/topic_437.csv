"simple regenerating codes: network coding for cloud storage. network codes designed specifically for distributed storage systems have the potential to provide dramatically higher storage efficiency for the same availability. one main challenge in the design of such codes is the exact repair problem: if a node storing encoded information fails, in order to maintain the same level of reliability we need to create encoded information at a new node. one of the main open problems in this emerging area has been the design of simple coding schemes that allow exact and low cost repair of failed nodes and have high data rates. in particular, all prior known explicit constructions have data rates bounded by 1/2. in this paper we introduce the first family of distributed storage codes that have simple look-up repair and can achieve arbitrarily high rates. our constructions are very simple to implement and perform exact repair by simple xoring of packets. we experimentally evaluate the proposed codes in a realistic cloud storage simulator and show significant benefits in both performance and reliability compared to replication and standard reed-solomon codes."
"exact minimum-repair-bandwidth cooperative regenerating codes for distributed storage systems. in order to provide high data reliability, distributed storage systems disperse data with redundancy to multiple storage nodes. regenerating codes is a new class of erasure codes to introduce redundancy for the purpose of improving the data repair performance in distributed storage. most of the studies on regenerating codes focus on the single-failure recovery, but it is not uncommon to see two or more node failures at the same time in large storage networks. to exploit the opportunity of repairing multiple failed nodes simultaneously, a cooperative repair mechanism, in the sense that the nodes to be repaired can exchange data among themselves, is investigated. a lower bound on the repair-bandwidth for cooperative repair is derived and a construction of a family of exact cooperative regenerating codes matching this lower bound is presented."
"exact regeneration codes for distributed storage repair using interference alignment. the high repair cost of (n,k) maximum distance separable (mds) erasure codes has recently motivated a new class of codes, called regenerating codes, that optimally trade off storage cost for repair bandwidth. on one end of this spectrum of regenerating codes are minimum storage regenerating (msr) codes that can match the minimum storage cost of mds codes while also significantly reducing repair bandwidth. in this paper, we describe exact-msr codes which allow for any failed nodes (whether they are systematic or parity nodes) to be regenerated exactly rather than only functionally or information-equivalently. we show that exact-msr codes come with no loss of optimality with respect to random-network-coding based msr codes (matching the cutset-based lower bound on repair bandwidth) for the cases of: (a) k/n <= 1/2; and (b) k <= 3. our constructive approach is based on interference alignment techniques, and, unlike the previous class of random-network-coding based approaches, we provide explicit and deterministic coding schemes that require a finite-field size of at most 2(n-k)."
