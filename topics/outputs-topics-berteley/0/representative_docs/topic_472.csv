"on large prime actions on riemann surfaces. in this article we study compact riemann surfaces of genus $g$ with an automorphism of prime order $g+1.$ the main result provides a classification of such surfaces. in addition, we give a description of them as algebraic curves, determine and realise their full automorphism groups and compute their fields of moduli. we also study some aspects of their jacobian varieties such as isogeny decompositions and complex multiplication. finally, we determine the period matrix of the accola-maclachlan curve of genus four."
"welschinger invariant and enumeration of real plane rational curves. welschinger's invariant bounds from below the number of real rational curves through a given generic collection of real points in the real projective plane. we estimate this invariant using mikhalkin's approach which deals with a corresponding count of tropical curves. in particular, our estimate implies that, for any positive integer $d$, there exists a real rational curve of degree $d$ through any collection of $3d-1$ real points in the projective plane, and, moreover, asymptotically in the logarithmic scale at least one third of the complex plane rational curves through a generic point collection are real. we also obtain similar results for curves on other toric del pezzo surfaces."
"plane curves with three syzygies, minimal tjurina curves curves, and nearly cuspidal curves. we start the study of reduced complex projective plane curves, whose jacobian syzygy module has 3 generators. among these curves one finds the nearly free curves introduced by the authors, and the plus-one generated line arrangements introduced by takuro abe. all the thom-sebastiani type plane curves, and more generally, any curve whose global tjurina number is equal to a lower bound given by a. du plessis and c.t.c. wall, are 3-syzygy curves. rational plane curves which are nearly cuspidal, i.e. which have only cusps except one singularity with two branches, are also related to this class of curves."
