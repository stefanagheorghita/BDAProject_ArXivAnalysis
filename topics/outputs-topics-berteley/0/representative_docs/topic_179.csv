"scalable parallel measurement of individual nitrogen-vacancy centers. the nitrogen-vacancy (nv) center in diamond is a solid-state spin defect that has been widely adopted for quantum sensing and quantum information processing applications. typically, experiments are performed either with a single isolated nv center or with an unresolved ensemble of many nv centers, resulting in a trade-off between measurement speed and spatial resolution or control over individual defects. in this work, we introduce an experimental platform that bypasses this trade-off by addressing multiple optically resolved nv centers in parallel. we perform charge- and spin-state manipulations selectively on multiple nv centers from within a larger set, and we manipulate and measure the electronic spin states of over 100 nv centers in parallel. we show that the high signal-to-noise ratio of the measurements enables the detection of shot-to-shot pairwise correlations between the spin states of 108 nv centers, corresponding to the simultaneous measurement of 5,778 unique correlation coefficients. we discuss how our platform can be scaled to parallel experiments with thousands of individually resolved nv centers. these results enable parallelized high-throughput sensing experiments that retain the nanoscale spatial resolution of single defects, and will thereby help to unlock advances in applications such as single-molecule nmr and characterization of integrated circuits. in addition, our approach to multiplexing provides a natural platform for the application of recently developed correlated sensing techniques."
"coherence of nitrogen-vacancy electronic spin ensembles in diamond. we present an experimental and theoretical study of electronic spin decoherence in ensembles of nitrogen-vacancy (nv) color centers in bulk high-purity diamond at room temperature. under appropriate conditions, we find ensemble nv spin coherence times (t_2) comparable to that of single nvs, with t_2 > 600 microseconds for a sample with natural abundance of 13c and paramagnetic impurity density ~10^15 cm^(-3). we also observe a sharp decrease of the coherence time with misalignment of the static magnetic field relative to the nv electronic spin axis, consistent with theoretical modeling of nv coupling to a 13c nuclear spin bath. the long coherence times and increased signal-to-noise provided by room-temperature nv ensembles will aid many applications of nv centers in precision magnetometry and quantum information."
"a coherence-protection scheme for quantum sensors based on ultra-shallow single nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond. recent advances in the engineering of diamond surfaces make it possible to stabilize the charge state of 7-30 nanometers deep nitrogen-vacancy (nv) quantum sensors in diamond and to remove the charge noise at the surface principally. however, it is still a challenge to simultaneously increase the action volume of the quantum sensor by placing nv centers 0.5-2 nanometers deep and to maintain their favorable spin coherence properties which are limited by the magnetic noise from the fluctuating nuclear spins of the surface termination of diamond. here we show by means of first principles simulations that leveraging the interplay of the surface-induced strain and small constant magnetic fields, the spin coherence times of the ultra-shallow 1-nanometer deep nv center can be significantly enhanced near the spin-phonon limited regime at room temperature in $^{12}$c enriched diamonds. we demonstrate that our protocol is beneficial to $\sim$10-nanometers deep nv centers in natural diamond too where the variable coherence properties of the center to the direction of the small constant magnetic fields establish vector magnetometry at the nanoscale."
