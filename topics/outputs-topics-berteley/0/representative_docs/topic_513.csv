"fatou components and singularities of meromorphic functions. we prove several results concerning the relative position of points in the postsingular set $p(f)$ of a meromorphic map $f$ and the boundary of a baker domain or the successive iterates of a wandering component. for baker domains we answer a question of mihaljevi\'c-brandt and rempe-gillen. for wandering domains we show that if the iterates $u_n$ of such a domain have uniformly bounded diameter, then there exists a sequence of postsingular values $p_n$ such that ${\rm dist}(p_n,\partial u_n)\to 0$ as $n\to \infty$. we also prove that if $u_n \cap p(f)=\emptyset$ and the postsingular set of $f$ lies at a positive distance from the julia set (in $\mathbb c$) then any sequence of iterates of wandering domains must contain arbitrarily large disks. this allows to exclude the existence of wandering domains for some meromorphic maps with infinitely many poles and unbounded set of singular values."
"multiply connected wandering domains of meromorphic functions: the pursuit of uniform internal dynamics. recently, benini et al. showed that, in simply connected wandering domains of entire functions, all pairs of orbits behave in the same way relative to the hyperbolic metric, thus giving us our first insight into the general internal dynamics of such domains. after proving in a recent manuscript that the same is not true for multiply connected wandering domains, a natural question is: how inhomogeneous can multiply connected wandering domains be? we give an answer to this question, in that we show that uniform dynamics inside an open subset of the domain generalises to the whole wandering domain. as an application of this result, we construct the first example of a meromorphic function with a semi-contracting infinitely connected wandering domain."
"classifying simply connected wandering domains. while the dynamics of transcendental entire functions in periodic fatou components and in multiply connected wandering domains are well understood, the dynamics in simply connected wandering domains have so far eluded classification. we give a detailed classification of the dynamics in such wandering domains in terms of the hyperbolic distances between iterates and also in terms of the behaviour of orbits in relation to the boundaries of the wandering domains. in establishing these classifications, we obtain new results of wider interest concerning non-autonomous forward dynamical systems of holomorphic self maps of the unit disk. we also develop a new general technique for constructing examples of bounded, simply connected wandering domains with prescribed internal dynamics, and a criterion to ensure that the resulting boundaries are jordan curves. using this technique, based on approximation theory, we show that all of the nine possible types of simply connected wandering domain resulting from our classifications are indeed realizable."
