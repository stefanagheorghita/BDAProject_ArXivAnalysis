"on the critical regularity of nonlinearities for semilinear classical wave equations. in this paper, we consider the cauchy problem for semilinear classical wave equations \begin{equation*} u_{tt}-\delta u=|u|^{p_s(n)}\mu(|u|) \end{equation*} with the strauss exponent $p_s(n)$ and a modulus of continuity $\mu=\mu(\tau)$, which provides an additional regularity of nonlinearities in $u=0$ comparing with the power nonlinearity $|u|^{p_s(n)}$. we obtain a sharp condition on $\mu$ as a threshold between global (in time) existence of small data radial solutions by deriving polynomial-logarithmic type weighted $l^{\infty}_tl^{\infty}_r$ estimates, and blow-up of solutions in finite time even for small data by applying iteration methods with slicing procedure. these results imply the critical regularity of source nonlinearities for semilinear classical wave equations."
"blow up for small-amplitude semilinear wave equations with mixed nonlinearities on asymptotically euclidean manifolds. in this work, we investigate the problem of finite time blow up as well as the upper bound estimates of lifespan for solutions to small-amplitude semilinear wave equations with mixed nonlinearities $a |u_t|^p+b |u|^q$, posed on asymptotically euclidean manifolds, which is related to both the strauss conjecture and glassey conjecture. in some cases, we obtain existence results, where the lower bound of the lifespan agrees with the upper bound in order. in addition, our results apply for semilinear damped wave equations, when the coefficient of the dissipation term is integrable (without sign condition) and space-independent."
blowup time and blowup rate for a pseudo-parabolic equation with singular potential. this paper provides the upper and lower bounds of blowup time and blowup rate as well as the exponential growth estimate of blowup solutions for a pseudo-parabolic equation with singular potential. these results complement the ones obtained in the previous literature.
