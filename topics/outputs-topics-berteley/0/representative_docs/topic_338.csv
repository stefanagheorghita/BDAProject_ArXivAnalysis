"impact of kuchowicz metric function on gravastars in f(r,t) theory. this paper discusses the configuration of gravitational vacuum star or gravastar with the impact of geometry and matter coupling present in $f(r,t)$ gravity. the gravastar is also conceptualized as a substitute for a black hole which is illustrated by three geometries known as (1) the interior geometry, (2) the intermediate thin-shell and (3) the exterior geometry. for a particular $f(r,t)$ model, we analyze these geometries corresponding to kuchowicz metric function. we evaluate another metric potential for the interior domain as well as the intermediate shell which is non-singular for both domains. the schwarzschild metric is adopted to demonstrate the exterior geometry of gravastar, while the numerical values of unknown constants are calculated through boundary conditions. finally, we discuss different features of gravastar regions like proper length, energy, surface redshift as well as equation of state parameter. we conclude that the gravastar model can be regarded as a successful replacement of the black hole in the context of this gravity."
"gravitational wave -- gauge field dynamics. the dynamics of a gravitational wave propagating through a cosmic gauge field are dramatically different than in vacuum. we show that a gravitational wave acquires an effective mass, is birefringent, and its normal modes are a linear combination of gravitational waves and gauge field excitations, leading to the phenomenon of gravitational wave -- gauge field oscillations. these surprising results provide insight into gravitational phenomena and may suggest new approaches to a theory of quantum gravity."
"interaction of electromagnetic field with a gravitational wave in minkowski and de-sitter space-time. it is important to re-examine some of the interactions of gravitational waves with matter due to the recent discovery of the waves in ligo. in a previous paper with morales, interaction of gravitational waves was studied with scalar and neutrino fields in minkowski space-time. in this paper, we find that electromagnetic waves have a similar interaction with gravitational wave in a flat background, and we comment on the implications of this for a gravitational wave detector. primordial gravitational waves were generated in the early universe and thus it is important to study interaction of the gravitational waves in cosmological backgrounds. in this paper we discuss the interaction of electromagnetic waves and gravitational waves in a de-sitter background. we find that the electromagnetic wave is perturbed and modulated. this result is new and will be useful in studying inhomogeneities in cosmic microwave background."
