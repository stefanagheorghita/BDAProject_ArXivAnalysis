"the dispersion of joint source-channel coding. in this work we investigate the behavior of the distortion threshold that can be guaranteed in joint source-channel coding, to within a prescribed excess-distortion probability. we show that the gap between this threshold and the optimal average distortion is governed by a constant that we call the joint source-channel dispersion. this constant can be easily computed, since it is the sum of the source and channel dispersions, previously derived. the resulting performance is shown to be better than that of any separation-based scheme. for the proof, we use unequal error protection channel coding, thus we also evaluate the dispersion of that setting."
a randomized covering-packing duality between source-coding and channel-coding. a randomized covering-packing duality between source and channel coding will be discussed by considering the source coding problem of coding a source with a certain distortion level and by considering a channel which communicates the source within a certain distortion level. an operational view of source-channel separation for communication with a fidelity criterion will be discussed in brief.
"second-order coding rates for conditional rate-distortion. this paper characterizes the second-order coding rates for lossy source coding with side information available at both the encoder and the decoder. we first provide non-asymptotic bounds for this problem and then specialize the non-asymptotic bounds for three different scenarios: discrete memoryless sources, gaussian sources, and markov sources. we obtain the second-order coding rates for these settings. it is interesting to observe that the second-order coding rate for gaussian source coding with gaussian side information available at both the encoder and the decoder is the same as that for gaussian source coding without side information. furthermore, regardless of the variance of the side information, the dispersion is $1/2$ nats squared per source symbol."
