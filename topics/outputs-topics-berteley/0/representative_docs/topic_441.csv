"massive abjm and black hole entropy in the presence of field strength coupling to curvature. assuming that the near horizon geometry of the black hole solution of the gravity dual to the abjm model, in the presence of a coupling between the weyl tensor and the field strength, is $ads_{2}\times s^{2}$, we compute sen's entropy function for this theory. by extremizing the entropy function we write a formula for the entropy of the black hole, and then we compute the same entropy using wald's formula and show that the results are the same. in this way we generalize the calculation of black hole entropy to cases of curvature coupling to the field strength, including at first order, and we also show how to calculate the black hole entropy when the black hole solution is unknown, from just a few simple assumptions about the horizon."
"flowing funnels: heat sources for field theories and the ads_3 dual of cft_2 hawking radiation. we construct the general 2+1 dimensional asymptotically ads_3 solution dual to a stationary 1+1 cft state on a black hole background. these states involve heat transport by the cft between the 1+1 black hole and infinity (or between two 1+1 black holes), and so describe the ads dual of cft hawking radiation. although the cft stress tensor is typically singular at the past horizon of the 1+1 black hole, the bulk 2+1-dimensional solutions are everywhere smooth, and in fact are diffeomorphic to ads_3. in particular, we find that unruh states of the cft on any finite-temperature 1+1 black hole background are described by extreme horizons in the bulk."
"hawking radiation in large n strongly-coupled field theories. we consider strongly coupled field theories at large n on black hole backgrounds. at sufficiently high hawking temperature t_h, one expects a phase where the black hole is in equilibrium with a deconfined plasma. we explore this phase in the context of the ads/cft correspondence, and argue that two possible behaviors may result. at a given hawking temperature t_h, field theories on large black hole backgrounds will couple strongly to the plasma and will be dual to novel bulk spacetimes having a single connected horizon which we dub {\it black funnels}. we construct examples of black funnels in low spacetime dimensions for different classes of field theory black holes. in this case, perturbing the equilibrium state results in the field theory exchanging heat with the black hole at a rate typical of conduction through deconfined plasma. in contrast, we argue that due to the finite physical size of plasma excitations, smaller black holes will couple only weakly to the field theory excitations. this situation is dual to bulk solutions containing two disconnected horizons which remain to be constructed. here perturbations lead to heat exchange at a level typical of confined phases, even when t_h remains far above any deconfinement transition. at least at large n and strong coupling, these two behaviors are separated by a sharp transition. our results also suggest a richer class of brane-world black holes than hitherto anticipated."
