"autonomous locomotion mode transition in quadruped track-legged robots: a simulation-based analysis for step negotiation. hybrid track/wheel-legged robots combine the advantages of wheel-based and leg-based locomotion, granting adaptability across varied terrains through efficient transitions between rolling and walking modes. however, automating these transitions remains a significant challenge. in this paper, we introduce a method designed for autonomous mode transition in a quadruped hybrid robot with a track/wheel-legged configuration, especially during step negotiation. our approach hinges on a decision-making mechanism that evaluates the energy efficiency of both locomotion modes using a proposed energy-based criterion. to guarantee a smooth negotiation of steps, we incorporate two climbing gaits designated for the assessment of energy usage in walking locomotion. simulation results validate the method's effectiveness, showing successful autonomous transitions across steps of diverse heights. our suggested approach has universal applicability and can be modified to suit other hybrid robots of similar mechanical configuration, provided their locomotion energy performance is studied beforehand."
"terrain adaptive gait transitioning for a quadruped robot using model predictive control. legged robots can traverse challenging terrain, use perception to plan their safe foothold positions, and navigate the environment. such unique mobility capabilities make these platforms a perfect candidate for scenarios such as search and rescue, inspection, and exploration tasks. while traversing through such terrains, the robot's instability is a significant concern. many times the robot needs to switch gaits depending on its environment. due to the complex dynamics of quadruped robots, classical pid control fails to provide high stability. thus, there is a need for advanced control methods like the model predictive control (mpc) which uses the system model and the nature of the terrain in order to predict the stable body pose of the robot. the controller also provides correction to any external disturbances that result in a change in the desired behavior of the robot. the mpc controller is designed in matlab, for full body torque control. the controller performance was verified on boston dynamics spot in webots simulator. the robot is able to provide correction for external perturbations up to 150 n and also resist falls till 80 cm."
"learning fast and agile quadrupedal locomotion over complex terrain. in this paper, we propose a robust controller that achieves natural and stably fast locomotion on a real blind quadruped robot. with only proprioceptive information, the quadruped robot can move at a maximum speed of 10 times its body length, and has the ability to pass through various complex terrains. the controller is trained in the simulation environment by model-free reinforcement learning. in this paper, the proposed loose neighborhood control architecture not only guarantees the learning rate, but also obtains an action network that is easy to transfer to a real quadruped robot. our research finds that there is a problem of data symmetry loss during training, which leads to unbalanced performance of the learned controller on the left-right symmetric quadruped robot structure, and proposes a mirror-world neural network to solve the performance problem. the learned controller composed of the mirror-world network can make the robot achieve excellent anti-disturbance ability. no specific human knowledge such as a foot trajectory generator are used in the training architecture. the learned controller can coordinate the robot's gait frequency and locomotion speed, and the locomotion pattern is more natural and reasonable than the artificially designed controller. our controller has excellent anti-disturbance performance, and has good generalization ability to reach locomotion speeds it has never learned and traverse terrains it has never seen before."
