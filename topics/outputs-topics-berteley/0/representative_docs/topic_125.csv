"small radius inclusive jet production at the lhc through nnlo+nnll. the study of hadronic jets and their substructure at hadronic colliders is crucial for improving our understanding of qcd, and searching for new physics. as such, there has been a significant effort to improve their theoretical description. in the small radius limit, inclusive jet production exhibits a universal factorization, enabling the resummation of logarithms which greatly stabilizes theoretical predictions. in this paper, we show how to combine a recently introduced framework for small-$r$ resummation with the stripper subtraction formalism for fragmentation, enabling next-to-next-to-leading order calculations of small-$r$ inclusive jet production for a wide variety of processes at the lhc. we extract the two-loop constants for the jet functions, enabling for the first time next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic resummation matched to next-to-next-to-leading order perturbative calculation. we compare with cms data for small-$r$ jet production, and find that our results greatly improve the accuracy of the predictions at small-$r$, and stabilize the perturbative convergence and error estimates at larger $r$. our approach is applicable to a wide class of jet substructure observables exhibiting similar factorization theorems, opening the door to an nnlo jet substructure program at the lhc."
"w+3 jet production at the lhc as a signal or background. we discuss the production of w bosons in association with three jets at the lhc. we investigate how next-to-leading order qcd corrections modify basic kinematic distributions of jets and leptons. we also address the magnitude of nlo qcd effects in w+3 jet observables, relevant for susy searches at the lhc."
"measurements of $\alpha_s$ in $pp$ collisions at the lhc. the coupling of the strong force, $\alpha_s$, is deemed to be a fundamental parameter of nature, and, beyond the quark masses, constitutes the only free parameter in the qcd lagrangian. provided is an overview of cern large hadron collider (lhc) measurements of $\alpha_s(m_z)$ evaluated at the $z$-boson mass and of the running of $\alpha_s(q)$ as a function of energy-momentum transfer $q$. the measurements were performed by the atlas and cms collaborations using proton-proton ($pp$) collisions with centre-of-mass energies of 7 tev and data samples with time-integrated luminosities up to 5 fb$^{-1}$. four different categories of observable were used in the described extractions of $\alpha_s$: inclusive jet cross sections, 3-jet to 2-jet inclusive cross-section ratios, 3-jet mass cross sections, and top-quark pair production cross sections. these results, which include the first nnlo measurement of $\alpha_s$ at a hadron collider and the first determinations of $\alpha_s$ at energy scales above 1 tev, are consistent with each other, with the world-average value, and with qcd predictions of their running with $q$."
