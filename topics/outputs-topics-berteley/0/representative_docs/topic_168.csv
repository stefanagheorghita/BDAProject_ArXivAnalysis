"fluxonium: an alternative qubit platform for high-fidelity operations. superconducting qubits provide a promising path toward building large-scale quantum computers. the simple and robust transmon qubit has been the leading platform, achieving multiple milestones. however, fault-tolerant quantum computing calls for qubit operations at error rates significantly lower than those exhibited in the state of the art. consequently, alternative superconducting qubits with better error protection have attracted increasing interest. among them, fluxonium is a particularly promising candidate, featuring large anharmonicity and long coherence times. here, we engineer a fluxonium-based quantum processor that integrates high qubit-coherence, fast frequency-tunability, and individual-qubit addressability for reset, readout, and gates. with simple and fast gate schemes, we achieve an average single-qubit gate fidelity of 99.97% and a two-qubit gate fidelity of up to 99.72%. this performance is comparable to the highest values reported in the literature of superconducting circuits. thus our work, for the first time within the realm of superconducting qubits, reveals an approach toward fault-tolerant quantum computing that is alternative and competitive to the transmon system."
"two-qubit gate operations in superconducting circuits with strong coupling and weak anharmonicity. we investigate theoretically the implementation of two-qubit gates in a system of two coupled superconducting qubits. in particular, we analyze two-qubit gate operations under the condition that the coupling strength is comparable to or even larger than the anharmonicity of the qubits. by numerically solving the time-dependent schr\""odinger equation, we obtain the dependence of the two-qubit gate fidelity on the system parameters in the case of direct and indirect qubit-qubit coupling. our numerical results can be used to identify the ""safe"" parameter regime for experimentally implementing two-qubit gates with high fidelity in these systems."
"characterization and tomography of a hidden qubit. in circuit-based quantum computing, the available gate set typically consists of single-qubit gates acting on each individual qubit and at least one entangling gate between pairs of qubits. in certain physical architectures, however, some qubits may be 'hidden' and lacking direct addressability through dedicated control and readout lines, for instance because of limited on-chip routing capabilities, or because the number of control lines becomes a limiting factor for many-qubit systems. in this case, no single-qubit operations can be applied to the hidden qubits and their state cannot be measured directly. instead, they may be controlled and read out only via single-qubit operations on connected 'control' qubits and a suitable set of two-qubit gates. we first discuss the impact of such restricted control capabilities on the quantum volume of specific qubit coupling networks. we then experimentally demonstrate full control and measurement capabilities in a superconducting two-qubit device with local single-qubit control and iswap and controlled-phase two-qubit interactions enabled by a tunable coupler. we further introduce an iterative tune-up process required to completely characterize the gate set used for quantum process tomography and evaluate the resulting gate fidelities."
