"heteromated decision-making: integrating socially assistive robots in care relationships. technological development continues to advance, with consequences for the use of robots in health care. for this reason, this workshop contribution aims at consideration of how socially assistive robots can be integrated into care and what tasks they can take on. this also touches on the degree of autonomy of these robots and the balance of decision support and decision making in different situations. we want to show that decision making by robots is mediated by the balance between autonomy and safety. our results are based on design fiction and zine-making workshops we conducted with scientific experts. ultimately, we show that robots' actions take place in social groups. a robot does not typically decide alone, but its decision-making is embedded in group processes. the concept of heteromation, which describes the interconnection of human and machine actions, offers fruitful possibilities for exploring how robots can be integrated into caring relationships."
"cobbler stick with your reads: people's perceptions of gendered robots performing gender stereotypical tasks. previous research found that robots should best be designed to fit their given task, whilst others identified gender effects in people's evaluations of robots. this study combines this knowledge to investigate stereotyping effects of robot genderedness and assigned tasks in an online experiment (n = 89) manipulating robot gender (male vs. female) and task type (analytical vs. social) in a between subject's design in terms of trust, social perception, and humanness. people deem robots more competent and have higher trust in their capacity when they perform analytical tasks compared to social tasks, independent of the robot's gender. furthermore, we observed a trend in the data indicating that people seem to dehumanize female robots (regardless of task performed) to animals lacking higher-level mental processes, and additionally that people seem to dehumanize robots to emotionless objects only when gendered robots perform tasks contradicting the stereotypes of their gender."
"""you might like it"": how people respond to small talk during human-robot collaboration. social communication between people and social robots has been studied extensively and found to have various notable benefits, including the enhancement of human-robot team cohesion and the development of rapport and trust. however, the potential of social communication between people and non-social robots, such as non-anthropomorphic robot manipulators commonly used in work settings (\eg warehouse and factory), is less explored and not well established. in this work, we investigate people's engagement and attitudes towards a non-anthropomorphic robot manipulator that initiates small talk during a collaborative assembly task and explore how the presence of negative team feedback may affect team dynamics and blame attribution. through an in-person study with 20 participants, we observed a response rate of 77.60% in response to the robot's small talk attempts. nine participants continued engaging with the robot by initiating their own questions, indicating sustained interest in the conversation. however, we also found that the first negative feedback decreased the participants' willingness to extend the conversation. we additionally present participants' initial perceptions of small talk for physical robot manipulators and discuss design implications for integrating small talk into non-social robots, along with various aspects of small talk that may influence physical human-robot interactions."
