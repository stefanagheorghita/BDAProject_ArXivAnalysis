"non-circular skyrmion and its anisotropic response in thin films of chiral magnets under tilted magnetic field. we study the equilibrium and dynamical properties of skyrmions in thin films of chiral magnets with oblique magnetic field. the shape of an individual skyrmion is non-circular and the skyrmion density decreases with the tilt angle from the normal of films. as a result, the interaction between two skyrmions depends on the relative angle between them in addition to their separation. the triangular lattice of skyrmions under a perpendicular magnetic field is distorted into a centered rectangular lattice for a tilted magnetic field. for a low skyrmion density, skyrmions form a chain like structure. the dynamical response of the non-circular skyrmions depends on the direction of external currents."
"skyrmion size in skyrmion crystals. a magnetic skyrmion is a topological object that can exist as a solitary embedded in the vast ferromagnetic phase, or coexists with a group of its ""siblings"" in various stripy phases as well as skyrmion crystals (skxs). isolated skyrmions and skyrmions in an skx are circular while a skyrmion in other phases is a stripe of various forms. unexpectedly, the sizes of the three different types of skyrmions depend on material parameters differently. for chiral magnetic films with exchange stiffness constant $a$, the dzyaloshinskii-moriya interaction (dmi) strength $d$, and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy $k$, $\kappa\equiv\pi^2d^2/(16ak)=1$ separates isolated skyrmions from condensed skyrmion states. in contrast to isolated skyrmions whose size increases with $d/k$ and is insensitive to $\kappa\ll1$ and stripe skyrmions whose width increases with $a/d$ and is insensitive to $\kappa\gg1$, the size of skyrmions in skxs is inversely proportional to the square root of skyrmion number density and decreases with $a/d$. this finding has important implications in our search for stable smaller skyrmions at the room temperature in applications."
"generation and hall effect of skyrmions enabled via using nonmagnetic point contacts. to enable functional skyrmion based spintronic devices, the controllable generation and manipulation of skyrmions is essential. while the generation of skyrmions by using a magnetic geometrical constriction has already been demonstrated, this approach is difficult to combine with a subsequent controlled manipulation of skyrmions. the high efficiency of skyrmion generation from magnetic constrictions limits the useful current density, resulting in stochastic skyrmion motion, which may obscure topological phenomena such as the skyrmion hall effect. in order to address this issue, we designed a nonmagnetic conducting ti/au point contact in devices made of ta/cofeb/taox trilayer films. by applying high voltage pulses, we experimentally demonstrated that skyrmions can be dynamically generated. moreover, the accompanied spin topology dependent skyrmion dynamics, the skyrmion hall effect is also experimentally observed in the same devices. the creation process has been numerically reproduced through micromagnetic simulations in which the important role of skyrmion-antiskyrmion pair generation is identified. the motion and hall effect of the skyrmions, immediately after their creation is described using a modified thiele equation after taking into account the contribution from spatially inhomogeneous spin-orbit torques and the magnus force. the simultaneous generation and manipulation of skyrmions using a nonmagnetic point contact could provide a useful pathway for designing novel skyrmion based devices."
