"permutation trinomials over finite fields with even characteristic. permutation polynomials have been a subject of study for a long time and have applications in many areas of science and engineering. however, only a small number of specific classes of permutation polynomials are described in the literature so far. in this paper we present a number of permutation trinomials over finite fields, which are of different forms."
permutation binomials over finite fields. let $\mathbb f_q$ denote the finite field with $q$ elements. in this paper we use the relationship between suitable polynomials and number of rational points on algebraic curves to give the exact number of elements $a\in \mathbb f_q$ for which the binomial $x^n(x^{(q-1)/r} + a)$ is a permutation polynomial in the cases $r = 2$ and $r = 3$.
"further investigation on cyclotomic mapping permutation polynomials over finite fields. we explore the connection between cyclotomic mapping permutation polynomials and permutation polynomials of the form $x^rf(x^{\frac{q-1}{l}})$ over finite fields. we present a new necessary and a new sufficient condition to verify permutation behavior of such polynomials over finite field. as its application, for particular values of $r$, we point out some permutation trinomials of the form $p(x)=2x^{r+8}+x^{r+4}+2x^r \in \mathbb{f}_{13}[x]$, and work on few classes of permutation binomials."
