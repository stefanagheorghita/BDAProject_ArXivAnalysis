"positive 1-in-3-sat admits a non-trivial kernel. we illustrate the strength of algebraic methods, adapting gaussian elimination and substitution to the problem of exact boolean satisfiability. for 1-in-3 sat with non-negated literals we are able to obtain considerably smaller equivalent instances of 0/1 integer programming restricted to equality only. both gaussian elimination and substitution may be used in a processing step, followed by a type of brute-force approach on the kernel thus obtained. our method shows that positive instances of 1-in-3 sat may be reduced to significantly smaller instances of i.p.e. in the following sense. any such instance of $|v|$ variables and $|c|$ clauses can be polynomial-time reduced to an instance of 0/1 integer programming with equality, of size at most $2/3|v|$ variables and at most $|c|$ clauses. we obtain an upper bound for the complexity of counting, $o(2\kappa r 2^{(1-\kappa) r})$ for number of variables $r$ and clauses to variables ratio $\kappa$. we proceed to define formally the notion of a non-trivial kernel, defining the problems considered as constraint satisfaction problems. we conclude showing the methods presented here, giving a non-trivial kernel for positive 1-in-3 sat, imply the existence of a non-trivial kernel for 1-in-3 sat."
"efficient analog circuits for boolean satisfiability. efficient solutions to np-complete problems would significantly benefit both science and industry. however, such problems are intractable on digital computers based on the von neumann architecture, thus creating the need for alternative solutions to tackle such problems. recently, a deterministic, continuous-time dynamical system (ctds) was proposed (nat.phys. {\bf 7}(12), 966 (2011)) to solve a representative np-complete problem, boolean satisfiability (sat). this solver shows polynomial analog time-complexity on even the hardest benchmark $k$-sat ($k \geq 3$) formulas, but at an energy cost through exponentially driven auxiliary variables. this paper presents a novel analog hardware sat solver, ac-sat, implementing the ctds via incorporating novel, analog circuit design ideas. ac-sat is intended to be used as a co-processor and is programmable for handling different problem specifications. it is especially effective for solving hard $k$-sat problem instances that are challenging for algorithms running on digital machines. furthermore, with its modular design, ac-sat can readily be extended to solve larger size problems, while the size of the circuit grows linearly with the product of the number of variables and number of clauses. the circuit is designed and simulated based on a 32nm cmos technology. spice simulation results show speedup factors of $\sim$10$^4$ on even the hardest 3-sat problems, when compared with a state-of-the-art sat solver on digital computers. as an example, for hard problems with $n=50$ variables and $m=212$ clauses, solutions are found within from a few $ns$ to a few hundred $ns$."
"the satisfiability threshold for non-uniform random 2-sat. propositional satisfiability (sat) is one of the most fundamental problems in computer science. its worst-case hardness lies at the core of computational complexity theory, for example in the form of np-hardness and the (strong) exponential time hypothesis. in practice however, sat instances can often be solved efficiently. this contradicting behavior has spawned interest in the average-case analysis of sat and has triggered the development of sophisticated rigorous and non-rigorous techniques for analyzing random structures. despite a long line of research and substantial progress, most theoretical work on random sat assumes a uniform distribution on the variables. in contrast, real-world instances often exhibit large fluctuations in variable occurrence. this can be modeled by a non-uniform distribution of the variables, which can result in distributions closer to industrial sat instances. we study satisfiability thresholds of non-uniform random $2$-sat with $n$ variables and $m$ clauses and with an arbitrary probability distribution $(p_i)_{i\in[n]}$ with $p_1 \ge p_2 \ge \ldots \ge p_n > 0$ over the n variables. we show for $p_1^2=\theta(\sum_{i=1}^n p_i^2)$ that the asymptotic satisfiability threshold is at $m=\theta( (1-\sum_{i=1}^n p_i^2)/(p_1\cdot(\sum_{i=2}^n p_i^2)^{1/2}) )$ and that it is coarse. for $p_1^2=o(\sum_{i=1}^n p_i^2)$ we show that there is a sharp satisfiability threshold at $m=(\sum_{i=1}^n p_i^2)^{-1}$. this result generalizes the seminal works by chvatal and reed [focs 1992] and by goerdt [jcss 1996]."
