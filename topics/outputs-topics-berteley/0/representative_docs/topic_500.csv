"vortex solutions of an abelian higgs model with visible and hidden sectors. we study vortex solutions in a theory with dynamics governed by two weakly coupled abelian higgs models, describing a hidden sector and a visible sector. we analyze the radial dependence of the axially symmetric solutions constructed numerically and discuss the stability of vortex configurations for different values of the model parameters, studying in detail vortex decay into lower energy configurations. we find that even in a weak coupling regime vortex solutions strongly depend on the parameters of both the visible and hidden sectors. we also discuss on qualitative grounds possible implications of the existence of a hidden sector in connection with superconductivity."
"topological chern-simons vortices in the $o(3) \sigma$-model. we present a (2+1)-dimensional gauged $o(3) \sigma$-model with an abelian chern--simons term. it shows topologically stable, anyonic vortices as classical solutions. the fields are studied in the case of rotational symmetry and analytic approximations are found for their asymptotic behaviour. the static euler--lagrange equations are solved numerically, where particular attention is paid to the dependence of the vortex' properties on the coupling to the gauge field. we compute the vortex mass and charge as a function of this coupling and obtain bound states for two--vortices as well as two--vortices with masses above the stability threshold."
"supersymmetry breaking on gauged non-abelian vortices. there are a large number of systems characterized by a completely broken gauge symmetry, but with an unbroken global color-flavor diagonal symmetry, i.e., systems in the so-called color-flavor locked phase. if the gauge symmetry breaking supports vortices, the latter develop non-abelian orientational zero-modes and become non-abelian vortices, a subject of intense study in the last several years. in this paper we consider the effects of weakly gauging the full exact global flavor symmetry in such systems, deriving an effective description of the light excitations in the presence of a vortex. surprising consequences are shown to follow. the fluctuations of the vortex orientational modes get diffused to bulk modes through tunneling processes. when our model is embedded in a supersymmetric theory, the vortex is still 1/2 bps saturated, but the vortex effective action breaks supersymmetry spontaneously."
