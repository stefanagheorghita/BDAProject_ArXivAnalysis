"binary neutron star mergers in fully general relativistic simulations. we perform 3d numerical simulations for merger of equal mass binary neutron stars in full general relativity preparing irrotational binary neutron stars in a quasiequilibrium state as initial conditions. simulations have been carried out for a wide range of stiffness of equations of state and compactness of neutron stars, paying particular attention to the final products and gravitational waves. we take a fixed uniform grid in cartesian coordinates with typical grid size $(293,293,147)$ in $(x,y,z)$ assuming a plane symmetry with respect to the equatorial plane. a result of one new large-scale simulation performed with grid size $(505,505,253)$ is also presented. we find that the final product depends sensitively on the initial compactness of the neutron stars: in a merger between sufficiently compact neutron stars, a black hole is formed in a dynamical timescale. as the compactness is decreased, the formation timescale becomes longer and longer. for less compact cases, a differentially rotating massive neutron star is formed instead of a black hole. in the case of black hole formation, the disk mass around the black hole appears to be smaller than 1% of the total rest mass. it is also indicated that waveforms of high-frequency gravitational waves after merger depend strongly on the compactness of neutron stars."
"impact of extreme spins and mass ratios on the post-merger observables of high-mass binary neutron stars. the gravitational-wave events gw170817 and gw190425 have led to a number of important insights on the equation of state of dense matter and the properties of neutron stars, such as their radii and the maximum mass. some of these conclusions have been drawn on the basis of numerical-relativity simulations of binary neutron-star mergers with vanishing initial spins. while this may be a reasonable assumption in equal-mass systems, it may be violated in the presence of large mass asymmetries accompanied by the presence of high spins. to quantify the impact of high spins on multi-messenger gravitational-wave events, we have carried out a series of high-mass binary neutron-star mergers with a highly spinning primary star and large mass asymmetries that have been modelled self-consistently using two temperature-dependent equations of state. we show that, when compared with equal-mass, irrotational binaries, these systems can lead to significant differences in the remnant lifetime, in the dynamical ejecta, in the remnant disc masses, in the secular ejecta, and on the bulk kilonova properties. these differences could be exploited to remove the degeneracy between low- and high-spin priors in the detection of gravitational waves from binary neutron-star mergers."
"relativistic sph calculations of compact binary mergers. we review recent progress in understanding the hydrodynamics of compact binary mergers using relativistic smoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph) codes. recent results are discussed for both double neutron stars and black hole - neutron star binaries. the gravitational wave signals from these mergers contain a lot of information about the masses and radii of the stars and the equation of state of the neutron star fluid. for black hole - neutron star mergers, the final fate of the fluid and the gravitational wave emission depend strongly on the mass ratio and the black hole spin."
