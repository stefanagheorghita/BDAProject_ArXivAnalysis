"dwarf stellar haloes: a powerful probe of small-scale galaxy formation and the nature of dark matter. we use n-body cosmological simulations and empirical galaxy models to study the merger history of dwarf-mass galaxies (with m_halo~10^10 m_sun). our input galaxy models describe the stellar mass-halo mass relation, and the galaxy occupation fraction. the number of major and minor mergers depends on the type of dark matter; in particular, minor mergers are greatly suppressed in warm dark matter models. in addition, the number of mergers that bring in stars is strongly dependent on the galaxy occupation model. for example, minor mergers are negligible for stellar halo growth in models with a high mass threshold for galaxy formation (i.e. 10^9.3 m_sun at z=0). moreover, this threshold for galaxy formation can also determine the relative difference (if any) between the stellar haloes of satellite and field dwarfs. using isolated simulations of dwarf-dwarf mergers, we show that the relative frequency of major and minor mergers predict very different stellar haloes: typically, ""intermediate"" dark matter merger ratios (~1:5) maximise the growth of distant stellar haloes. we discuss the observability of dwarf stellar haloes and find that the surface brightness of these features are incredibly faint. however, when several dwarfs are stacked together models that form particularly rich stellar haloes could be detectable. finally, we show that stellar streams in the galactic halo overlapping in phase-space with known dwarf satellites are likely remnants of their stripped stellar haloes. the mere existence of dwarf stellar haloes can already put constraints on some small-scale models, and thus observational probes should be a high priority."
"tracing dark matter halos with satellite kinematics and the central stellar velocity dispersion of galaxies. it has been suggested that the central stellar velocity dispersion of galaxies can trace dark matter halo mass directly. we test this hypothesis using a complete spectroscopic sample of isolated galaxies surrounded by faint satellite galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey data release 12. we apply a friends-of-friends algorithm with projected linking length $\delta d < 100$ kpc and radial velocity linking length $\delta v < 1000$ km s$^{-1}$ to construct our sample. our sample includes 2807 isolated galaxies with 3417 satellite galaxies at $0.01 < z < 0.14$. we divide the sample into two groups based on the primary galaxy color: red and blue primary galaxies separated at $(g-r)_{0} = 0.85$. the central stellar velocity dispersions of the primary galaxies are proportional to the luminosities and stellar masses of the same galaxies. stacking the sample based on the central velocity dispersion of the primary galaxies, we derive the velocity dispersions of their satellite galaxies, which trace the dark matter halo mass of the primary galaxies. the system velocity dispersion of the satellite galaxies shows a remarkably tight correlation with the central velocity dispersion of the primary galaxies for both red and blue samples. in particular, the slope of the relation is identical to 1 for red primary systems. this tight relation suggests that the central stellar velocity dispersion of galaxies is indeed an efficient and robust tracer for dark matter halo mass. we provide empirical relations between the central stellar velocity dispersion and the dark matter halo mass."
"satellite systems around galaxies in hydrodynamic simulations. we investigate the properties of satellite galaxies formed in n-body/sph simulations of galaxy formation in the $\lambda$cdm cosmology. the simulations include the main physical effects thought to be important in galaxy formation and, in several cases, produce realistic spiral discs. in total, a sample of 9 galaxies of luminosity comparable to the milky way was obtained. at magnitudes brighter than the resolution limit, $m_v=-12$, the luminosity function of the satellite galaxies in the simulations is in excellent agreement with data for the local group. the radial number density profile of the model satellites, as well as their gas fractions also match observations very well. in agreement with previous n-body studies, we find that the satellites tend to be distributed in highly flattened configurations whose major axis is aligned with the major axis of the (generally triaxial) dark halo. in 2 out of 3 systems with sufficiently large satellite populations, the satellite system is nearly perpendicular to the plane of the galactic disc, a configuration analogous to that observed in the milk way. the discs themselves are perpendicular to the minor axis of their host halos in the inner parts, and the correlation between the orientation of the galaxy and the shape of the halo persists even out to the virial radius. however, in one case the disc's minor axis ends up, at the virial radius, perpendicular to the minor axis of the halo. the angular momenta of the galaxies and their host halo tend to be well aligned."
