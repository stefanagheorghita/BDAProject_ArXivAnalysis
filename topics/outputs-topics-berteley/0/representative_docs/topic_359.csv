"a new exact algorithm for traveling salesman problem with time complexity interval (o(n^4), o(n^3*2^n)). traveling salesman problem is a np-hard problem. until now, researchers have not found a polynomial time algorithm for traveling salesman problem. among the existing algorithms, dynamic programming algorithm can solve the problem in time o(n^2*2^n) where n is the number of nodes in the graph. the branch-and-cut algorithm has been applied to solve the problem with a large number of nodes. however, branch-and-cut algorithm also has an exponential worst-case running time. in this paper, a new exact algorithm for traveling salesman problem is proposed. the algorithm can be used to solve an arbitrary instance of traveling salesman problem in real life and the time complexity interval of the algorithm is (o(n^4), o(n^3*2^n)). it means that for some instances, the algorithm can find the optimal solution in polynomial time although the algorithm also has an exponential worst-case running time. in other words, the algorithm tells us that not all the instances of traveling salesman problem need exponential time to compute the optimal solution. the algorithm of this paper can not only assist us to solve traveling salesman problem better, but also can assist us to deepen the comprehension of the relationship between np-complete and p. therefore, it is considerable in the further research on traveling salesman problem and np-hard problem."
"reassembling trees for the traveling salesman. many recent approximation algorithms for different variants of the traveling salesman problem (asymmetric tsp, graph tsp, s-t-path tsp) exploit the well-known fact that a solution of the natural linear programming relaxation can be written as convex combination of spanning trees. the main argument then is that randomly sampling a tree from such a distribution and then completing the tree to a tour at minimum cost yields a better approximation guarantee than simply taking a minimum cost spanning tree (as in christofides' algorithm). we argue that an additional step can help: reassembling the spanning trees before sampling. exchanging two edges in a pair of spanning trees can improve their properties under certain conditions. we demonstrate the usefulness for the metric s-t-path tsp by devising a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm that improves on seb\h{o}'s previously best approximation ratio of 8/5."
"optimising tours for the weighted traveling salesperson problem and the traveling thief problem: a structural comparison of solutions. the traveling salesperson problem (tsp) is one of the best-known combinatorial optimisation problems. however, many real-world problems are composed of several interacting components. the traveling thief problem (ttp) addresses such interactions by combining two combinatorial optimisation problems, namely the tsp and the knapsack problem (kp). recently, a new problem called the node weight dependent traveling salesperson problem (w-tsp) has been introduced where nodes have weights that influence the cost of the tour. in this paper, we compare w-tsp and ttp. we investigate the structure of the optimised tours for w-tsp and ttp and the impact of using each others fitness function. our experimental results suggest (1) that the w-tsp often can be solved better using the ttp fitness function and (2) final w-tsp and ttp solutions show different distributions when compared with optimal tsp or weighted greedy solutions."
