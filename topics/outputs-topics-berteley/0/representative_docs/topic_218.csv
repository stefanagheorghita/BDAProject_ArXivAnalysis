"a 3-stage spectral-spatial method for hyperspectral image classification. hyperspectral images often have hundreds of spectral bands of different wavelengths captured by aircraft or satellites that record land coverage. identifying detailed classes of pixels becomes feasible due to the enhancement in spectral and spatial resolution of hyperspectral images. in this work, we propose a novel framework that utilizes both spatial and spectral information for classifying pixels in hyperspectral images. the method consists of three stages. in the first stage, the pre-processing stage, nested sliding window algorithm is used to reconstruct the original data by {enhancing the consistency of neighboring pixels} and then principal component analysis is used to reduce the dimension of data. in the second stage, support vector machines are trained to estimate the pixel-wise probability map of each class using the spectral information from the images. finally, a smoothed total variation model is applied to smooth the class probability vectors by {ensuring spatial connectivity} in the images. we demonstrate the superiority of our method against three state-of-the-art algorithms on six benchmark hyperspectral data sets with 10 to 50 training labels for each class. the results show that our method gives the overall best performance in accuracy. especially, our gain in accuracy increases when the number of labeled pixels decreases and therefore our method is more advantageous to be applied to problems with small training set. hence it is of great practical significance since expert annotations are often expensive and difficult to collect."
"punch: positive unlabelled classification based information retrieval in hyperspectral images. hyperspectral images of land-cover captured by airborne or satellite-mounted sensors provide a rich source of information about the chemical composition of the materials present in a given place. this makes hyperspectral imaging an important tool for earth sciences, land-cover studies, and military and strategic applications. however, the scarcity of labeled training examples and spatial variability of spectral signature are two of the biggest challenges faced by hyperspectral image classification. in order to address these issues, we aim to develop a framework for material-agnostic information retrieval in hyperspectral images based on positive-unlabelled (pu) classification. given a hyperspectral scene, the user labels some positive samples of a material he/she is looking for and our goal is to retrieve all the remaining instances of the query material in the scene. additionally, we require the system to work equally well for any material in any scene without the user having to disclose the identity of the query material. this material-agnostic nature of the framework provides it with superior generalization abilities. we explore two alternative approaches to solve the hyperspectral image classification problem within this framework. the first approach is an adaptation of non-negative risk estimation based pu learning for hyperspectral data. the second approach is based on one-versus-all positive-negative classification where the negative class is approximately sampled using a novel spectral-spatial retrieval model. we propose two annotator models - uniform and blob - that represent the labelling patterns of a human annotator. we compare the performances of the proposed algorithms for each annotator model on three benchmark hyperspectral image datasets - indian pines, pavia university and salinas."
"hyperspectral image super-resolution via deep spatio-spectral convolutional neural networks. hyperspectral images are of crucial importance in order to better understand features of different materials. to reach this goal, they leverage on a high number of spectral bands. however, this interesting characteristic is often paid by a reduced spatial resolution compared with traditional multispectral image systems. in order to alleviate this issue, in this work, we propose a simple and efficient architecture for deep convolutional neural networks to fuse a low-resolution hyperspectral image (lr-hsi) and a high-resolution multispectral image (hr-msi), yielding a high-resolution hyperspectral image (hr-hsi). the network is designed to preserve both spatial and spectral information thanks to an architecture from two folds: one is to utilize the hr-hsi at a different scale to get an output with a satisfied spectral preservation; another one is to apply concepts of multi-resolution analysis to extract high-frequency information, aiming to output high quality spatial details. finally, a plain mean squared error loss function is used to measure the performance during the training. extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed network architecture achieves best performance (both qualitatively and quantitatively) compared with recent state-of-the-art hyperspectral image super-resolution approaches. moreover, other significant advantages can be pointed out by the use of the proposed approach, such as, a better network generalization ability, a limited computational burden, and a robustness with respect to the number of training samples."
