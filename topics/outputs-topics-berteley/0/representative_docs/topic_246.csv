"knowledge-aware graph transformer for pedestrian trajectory prediction. predicting pedestrian motion trajectories is crucial for path planning and motion control of autonomous vehicles. accurately forecasting crowd trajectories is challenging due to the uncertain nature of human motions in different environments. for training, recent deep learning-based prediction approaches mainly utilize information like trajectory history and interactions between pedestrians, among others. this can limit the prediction performance across various scenarios since the discrepancies between training datasets have not been properly incorporated. to overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a graph transformer structure to improve prediction performance, capturing the differences between the various sites and scenarios contained in the datasets. in particular, a self-attention mechanism and a domain adaption module have been designed to improve the generalization ability of the model. moreover, an additional metric considering cross-dataset sequences is introduced for training and performance evaluation purposes. the proposed framework is validated and compared against existing methods using popular public datasets, i.e., eth and ucy. experimental results demonstrate the improved performance of our proposed scheme."
"trajectory-prediction with vision: a survey. to plan a safe and efficient route, an autonomous vehicle should anticipate future trajectories of other agents around it. trajectory prediction is an extremely challenging task which recently gained a lot of attention in the autonomous vehicle research community. trajectory-prediction forecasts future state of all the dynamic agents in the scene given their current and past states. a good prediction model can prevent collisions on the road, and hence the ultimate goal for autonomous vehicles: collision rate: collisions per million miles. the objective of this paper is to provide an overview of the field trajectory-prediction. we categorize the relevant algorithms into different classes so that researchers can follow through the trends in the trajectory-prediction research field. moreover we also touch upon the background knowledge required to formulate a trajectory-prediction problem."
"social-wagdat: interaction-aware trajectory prediction via wasserstein graph double-attention network. effective understanding of the environment and accurate trajectory prediction of surrounding dynamic obstacles are indispensable for intelligent mobile systems (like autonomous vehicles and social robots) to achieve safe and high-quality planning when they navigate in highly interactive and crowded scenarios. due to the existence of frequent interactions and uncertainty in the scene evolution, it is desired for the prediction system to enable relational reasoning on different entities and provide a distribution of future trajectories for each agent. in this paper, we propose a generic generative neural system (called social-wagdat) for multi-agent trajectory prediction, which makes a step forward to explicit interaction modeling by incorporating relational inductive biases with a dynamic graph representation and leverages both trajectory and scene context information. we also employ an efficient kinematic constraint layer applied to vehicle trajectory prediction which not only ensures physical feasibility but also enhances model performance. the proposed system is evaluated on three public benchmark datasets for trajectory prediction, where the agents cover pedestrians, cyclists and on-road vehicles. the experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves better performance than various baseline approaches in terms of prediction accuracy."
