"decomposition and (non-invertible) (-1)-form symmetries from the symmetry topological field theory. we investigate the interplay between (-1)-form symmetries and their quantum-dual (d-1)-form counterparts within the framework of symmetry topological field theories (symtfts). in this framework the phenomenon of decomposition -- a d-dimensional quantum field theory with (d-1)-form symmetry being the disjoint union of other theories (or ''universes'') -- arises naturally from manipulations of topological boundary conditions of the symtft. we corroborate our findings with various examples, including a generalization of ''instanton-restricted'' 4d yang-mills theories with no sum over instanton sectors. furthermore, we construct a 3d symtft with a non-invertible (-1)-form symmetry. the absolute 2d quantum field theory includes a 0-form global symmetry that depends on a parameter whose value gets shifted by the action of the (-1)-form symmetry, and we show that the non-invertibility of the latter is needed to encode this modification of the 0-form symmetry."
"aspects of categorical symmetries from branes: symtfts and generalized charges. recently it has been observed that branes in geometric engineering and holography have a striking connection with generalized global symmetries. in this paper we argue that branes, in a certain topological limit, not only furnish the symmetry generators, but also encode the so-called symmetry topological field theory (or symtft). for a $d$-dimensional qft, this is a $(d+1)$-dimensional topological field theory, whose topological defects encode both the symmetry generators (invertible or non-invertible) and the generalized charges. mathematically, the topological defects form the drinfeld center of the symmetry category of the qft. in this paper we derive the symtft and the drinfeld center topological defects directly from branes. central to the identification of these are hanany-witten brane configurations, which encode both topological couplings in the symtft and the generalized charges under the symmetries. we exemplify the general analysis with examples of qfts realized in geometric engineering or holography."
"the large-charge expansion in nonrelativistic conformal field theories. conformal field theories (cfts) are associated with critical phenomena and phase transitions and also play an essential role in string theory. solving a cft is an extremely constrained problem due to conformal invariance -- the task essentially reduces to the computation of a set of numbers called the cft data -- yet it remains highly nontrivial. in fact, cfts usually are strongly coupled and thus require new tools that do not rely on perturbation theory. for these reasons, in the past few decades, they became one of the most active fields of research. a natural extension of these ideas with far-reaching implications for condensed matter systems -- in which relativistic effects are not manifest -- is to replace the poincare group by the galilean group, thereby opening the way to a precise formulation of a whole new class of critical phenomena in terms of nonrelativistic conformal field theories (nrcfts). many of the aforementioned tools developed to gain a better formal understanding of cfts can then be adapted to gain a strong predictive power in systems with direct experimental relevance. in recent years, a new powerful tool has emerged: the large-charge expansion. it allows to systemically uncover part of the cft data of theories with global symmetries, thereby revealing profound and universal features of these systems. using the state-operator correspondence, most of the computations are further reduced to the evaluation of energy levels in a finite-density system described by a large-charge effective field theory, usually associated with a conformal superfluid phase. the large-charge dynamics in the nonrelativistic case is however richer -- and therefore, more challenging -- than its relativistic counterpart. in this thesis, we discuss recent progress which opened the door to many new exciting large-charge applications."
