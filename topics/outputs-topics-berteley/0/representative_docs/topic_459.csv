"spectral invariants for polygons and orbisurfaces. in this thesis we deal with spectral invariants for polygons and closed orbisurfaces of constant gaussian curvature. in each case our method is to study the heat kernel and the asymptotic expansion of the heat trace. first, we investigate hyperbolic polygons, i.e. relatively compact domains in the hyperbolic plane with piecewise geodesic boundary. we compute the asymptotic expansion of the heat trace associated to the dirichlet laplacian of any hyperbolic polygon, and we obtain explicit formulas for all heat invariants. analogous results for euclidean and spherical polygons were known before. we unify these results and deduce the heat invariants for arbitrary polygons, i.e. for relatively compact domains with piecewise geodesic boundary contained in a complete riemannian manifold of constant gaussian curvature. it turns out that the heat invariants provide much information about a polygon, if the curvature does not vanish. for example, then the multiset of all real angles (i.e. those which are not equal to pi) and the euler characteristic of a polygon are spectral invariants. furthermore, we compute the asymptotic expansion of the heat trace for any closed riemannian orbisurface of constant curvature, and obtain explicit formulas for all heat invariants. if the curvature does not vanish, then it is possible to detect interesting information about the topology and the singular set of an orbisurface from the heat invariants."
"special functions for heat kernel expansion. in this paper, we study an asymptotic expansion of the heat kernel for a laplace operator on a smooth riemannian manifold without a boundary at enough small values of the proper time. the seeley-dewitt coefficients of this decomposition satisfy a set of recurrence relations, which we use to construct two function families of a special kind. using these functions, we study the expansion of a local heat kernel for the inverse laplace operator. we show that the new functions have some important properties. for example, we can consider the laplace operator on the function set as a shift one. also we describe various applications useful in theoretical physics and, in particular, we find a decomposition of green's functions near the diagonal in terms of new functions."
heat content asymptotics for operators of laplace type with spectral boundary conditions. let $p$ be an operator of dirac type and let $d=p^2$ be the associated operator of laplace type. we impose spectral boundary conditions and study the leading heat content coefficients for $d$.
