"calibration of shared equilibria in general sum partially observable markov games. training multi-agent systems (mas) to achieve realistic equilibria gives us a useful tool to understand and model real-world systems. we consider a general sum partially observable markov game where agents of different types share a single policy network, conditioned on agent-specific information. this paper aims at i) formally understanding equilibria reached by such agents, and ii) matching emergent phenomena of such equilibria to real-world targets. parameter sharing with decentralized execution has been introduced as an efficient way to train multiple agents using a single policy network. however, the nature of resulting equilibria reached by such agents has not been yet studied: we introduce the novel concept of shared equilibrium as a symmetric pure nash equilibrium of a certain functional form game (ffg) and prove convergence to the latter for a certain class of games using self-play. in addition, it is important that such equilibria satisfy certain constraints so that mas are calibrated to real world data for practical use: we solve this problem by introducing a novel dual-reinforcement learning based approach that fits emergent behaviors of agents in a shared equilibrium to externally-specified targets, and apply our methods to a n-player market example. we do so by calibrating parameters governing distributions of agent types rather than individual agents, which allows both behavior differentiation among agents and coherent scaling of the shared policy network to multiple agents."
"a primal-dual method for conic constrained distributed optimization problems. we consider cooperative multi-agent consensus optimization problems over an undirected network of agents, where only those agents connected by an edge can directly communicate. the objective is to minimize the sum of agent-specific composite convex functions over agent-specific private conic constraint sets; hence, the optimal consensus decision should lie in the intersection of these private sets. we provide convergence rates both in sub-optimality, infeasibility and consensus violation; examine the effect of underlying network topology on the convergence rates of the proposed decentralized algorithms; and show how to extend these methods to handle time-varying communications networks and to solve problems with resource sharing constraints."
"consensus with linear objective maps. a consensus system is a linear multi-agent system in which agents communicate to reach a so-called consensus state, defined as the average of the initial states of the agents. consider a more generalized situation in which each agent is given a positive weight and the consensus state is defined as the weighted average of the initial conditions. we characterize in this paper the weighted averages that can be evaluated in a decentralized way by agents communicating over a directed graph. specifically, we introduce a linear function, called the objective map, that defines the desired final state as a function of the initial states of the agents. we then provide a complete answer to the question of whether there is a decentralized consensus dynamics over a given digraph which converges to the final state specified by an objective map. in particular, we characterize not only the set of objective maps that are feasible for a given digraph, but also the consensus dynamics that implements the objective map. in addition, we present a decentralized algorithm to design the consensus dynamics."
