"reducing uncertainty in undersampled mri reconstruction with active acquisition. the goal of mri reconstruction is to restore a high fidelity image from partially observed measurements. this partial view naturally induces reconstruction uncertainty that can only be reduced by acquiring additional measurements. in this paper, we present a novel method for mri reconstruction that, at inference time, dynamically selects the measurements to take and iteratively refines the prediction in order to best reduce the reconstruction error and, thus, its uncertainty. we validate our method on a large scale knee mri dataset, as well as on imagenet. results show that (1) our system successfully outperforms active acquisition baselines; (2) our uncertainty estimates correlate with error maps; and (3) our resnet-based architecture surpasses standard pixel-to-pixel models in the task of mri reconstruction. the proposed method not only shows high-quality reconstructions but also paves the road towards more applicable solutions for accelerating mri."
"diffusion modeling with domain-conditioned prior guidance for accelerated mri and qmri reconstruction. this study introduces a novel approach for image reconstruction based on a diffusion model conditioned on the native data domain. our method is applied to multi-coil mri and quantitative mri reconstruction, leveraging the domain-conditioned diffusion model within the frequency and parameter domains. the prior mri physics are used as embeddings in the diffusion model, enforcing data consistency to guide the training and sampling process, characterizing mri k-space encoding in mri reconstruction, and leveraging mr signal modeling for qmri reconstruction. furthermore, a gradient descent optimization is incorporated into the diffusion steps, enhancing feature learning and improving denoising. the proposed method demonstrates a significant promise, particularly for reconstructing images at high acceleration factors. notably, it maintains great reconstruction accuracy and efficiency for static and quantitative mri reconstruction across diverse anatomical structures. beyond its immediate applications, this method provides potential generalization capability, making it adaptable to inverse problems across various domains."
"ernas: an evolutionary neural architecture search for magnetic resonance image reconstructions. magnetic resonance imaging (mri) is one of the noninvasive imaging modalities that can produce high-quality images. however, the scan procedure is relatively slow, which causes patient discomfort and motion artifacts in images. accelerating mri hardware is constrained by physical and physiological limitations. a popular alternative approach to accelerated mri is to undersample the k-space data. while undersampling speeds up the scan procedure, it generates artifacts in the images, and advanced reconstruction algorithms are needed to produce artifact-free images. recently deep learning has emerged as a promising mri reconstruction method to address this problem. however, straightforward adoption of the existing deep learning neural network architectures in mri reconstructions is not usually optimal in terms of efficiency and reconstruction quality. in this work, mri reconstruction from undersampled data was carried out using an optimized neural network using a novel evolutionary neural architecture search algorithm. brain and knee mri datasets show that the proposed algorithm outperforms manually designed neural network-based mr reconstruction models."
