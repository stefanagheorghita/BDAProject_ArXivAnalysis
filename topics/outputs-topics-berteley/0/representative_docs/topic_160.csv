"fdd massive mimo channel training optimal rate distortion bounds and the efficiency of one-shot schemes. we study the problem of providing channel state information (csi) at the transmitter in multi-user massive mimo systems operating in frequency division duplexing (fdd). the wideband mimo channel is a vector-valued random process correlated in time, space (antennas), and frequency (subcarriers). the base station (bs) broadcasts periodically beta_tr pilot symbols from its m antenna ports to k single-antenna users (ues). correspondingly, the k ues send feedback messages about their channel state using beta_fb symbols in the uplink (ul). using results from remote rate-distortion theory, we show that, as snr reaches infty, the optimal feedback strategy achieves a channel state estimation mean squared error (mse) that behaves as theta(1) if beta_tr < r and as theta(snr^(-alpha)) when beta_tr >=r, where alpha = min(beta_fb/r, 1), where r is the rank of the channel covariance matrix. the mse-optimal rate-distortion strategy implies encoding of long sequences of channel states, which would yield completely stale csi and therefore poor multiuser precoding performance. hence, we consider three practical one-shot csi strategies with minimum one-slot delay and analyze their large-snr channel estimation mse behavior. these are: (1) digital feedback via entropy-coded scalar quantization (ecsq), (2) analog feedback (af), and (3) local channel estimation at the ues and digital feedback. these schemes have different requirements in terms of knowledge of the channel statistics at the ue and at the bs. in particular, the latter strategy requires no statistical knowledge and is closely inspired by a csi feedback scheme currently proposed in 3gpp standardization."
"on the capacity and design of limited feedback multiuser mimo uplinks. the theory of multiple-input multiple-output (mimo) technology has been well-developed to increase fading channel capacity over single-input single-output (siso) systems. this capacity gain can often be leveraged by utilizing channel state information at the transmitter and the receiver. users make use of this channel state information for transmit signal adaptation. in this correspondence, we derive the capacity region for the mimo multiple access channel (mimo mac) when partial channel state information is available at the transmitters, where we assume a synchronous mimo multiuser uplink. the partial channel state information feedback has a cardinality constraint and is fed back from the basestation to the users using a limited rate feedback channel. using this feedback information, we propose a finite codebook design method to maximize sum-rate. in this correspondence, the codebook is a set of transmit signal covariance matrices. we also derive the capacity region and codebook design methods in the case that the covariance matrix is rank-one (i.e., beamforming). this is motivated by the fact that beamforming is optimal in certain conditions. the simulation results show that when the number of feedback bits increases, the capacity also increases. even with a small number of feedback bits, the performance of the proposed system is close to an optimal solution with the full feedback."
"capacity scaling of massive mimo in strong spatial correlation regimes. this paper investigates the capacity scaling of multicell massive mimo systems in the presence of spatially correlated fading. in particular, we focus on the strong spatial correlation regimes where the covariance matrix of each user channel vector has a rank that scales sublinearly with the number of base station antennas, as the latter grows to infinity. we also consider the case where the covariance eigenvectors corresponding to the non-zero eigenvalues span randomly selected subspaces. for this channel model, referred to as the ""random sparse angular support"" model, we characterize the asymptotic capacity scaling law in the limit of large number of antennas. to achieve the asymptotic capacity results, statistical spatial despreading based on the second-order channel statistics plays a pivotal role in terms of pilot decontamination and interference suppression. a remarkable result is that even when the number of users scales linearly with base station antennas, a linear growth of the capacity with respect to the number of antennas is achievable under the sparse angular support model. we note that the achievable rate lower bound based on massive mimo ""channel hardening"", widely used in the massive mimo literature, yields rather loose results in the strong spatial correlation regimes and may significantly underestimate the achievable rate of massive mimo. this work therefore considers an alternative bounding technique which is better suited to the strong correlation regimes. in fading channels with sparse angular support, it is further shown that spatial despreading (spreading) in uplink (downlink) has a more prominent impact on the performance of massive mimo than channel hardening."
