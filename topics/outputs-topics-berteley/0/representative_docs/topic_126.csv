"betti numbers of smooth schubert varieties and the remarkable formula of kostant,macdonald,shapiro and steinberg. the purpose of this note is to give a refinement of the product formula proved in [1] for the poincare polynomial of a smooth schubert variety in the flag variety of an algebraic group g over c. this yields a factorization of the number of elements in a bruhat interval [e,w] in the weyl group w of g provided the schubert variety associated to w is smooth. this gives an elementary necessary condition for a schubert variety in the flag variety to be smooth."
degenerate flag varieties and schubert varieties: a characteristic free approach. we consider the pbw filtrations over the integers of the irreducible highest weight modules in type a and c. we show that the associated graded modules can be realized as demazure modules for group schemes of the same type and doubled rank. we deduce that the corresponding degenerate flag varieties are isomorphic to schubert varieties in any characteristic.
"which schubert varieties are hessenberg varieties?. after proving that every schubert variety in the full flag variety of a complex reductive group $g$ is a general hessenberg variety, we show that not all such schubert varieties are adjoint hessenberg varieties. in fact, in types a and c, we provide pattern avoidance criteria implying that the proportion of schubert varieties that are adjoint hessenberg varieties approaches zero as the rank of $g$ increases. we show also that in type a, some schubert varieties are not isomorphic to any adjoint hessenberg variety."
