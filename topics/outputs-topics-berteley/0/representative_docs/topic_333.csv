"influence of thermal fluctuations on an underdamped josephson tunnel junction. inspired by a recent experiment, we study the influence of thermal fluctuations on the $i$-$v$ characteristics of a josephson junction, coupled to a strongly resistive environment. we obtain analytical results in the limit where the josephson energy is larger than the charging energy and quasiparticles are absent."
"fractional calculus approach for the phase dynamics of josephson junction under the influence of magnetic field. this article presents the phase dynamics of an inline long josephson junction in voltage state under the influence of constant external magnetic field. fractional calculus approach is used to model the evolution of the phase difference between the macroscopic wave functions of the two superconductors across the junction. the governing non-linear partial differential equation is then solved using finite difference-finite element schemes. other quantities of interest like josephson current density and voltage across the junction are also computed. the effects of various parameters in the model on phase difference, josephson current density and voltage are analyzed graphically with the help of numerical simulations."
"bolometric detection of josephson inductance in a highly resistive environment. the josephson junction is a building block of quantum circuits. its behavior, well understood when treated as an isolated entity, is strongly affected by coupling to an electromagnetic environment. in 1983, schmid predicted that a josephson junction shunted by a resistance exceeding the resistance quantum $\mathbf{\textit{r}}_\mathrm{q} = h/4e^2 \approx 6.45$ k$\mathbf{\omega}$ for cooper pairs would become insulating since the phase fluctuations would destroy the coherent josephson coupling. however, recent microwave measurements have questioned this interpretation. here, we insert a small josephson junction in a johnson-nyquist-type setup where it is driven by weak current noise arising from thermal fluctuations. our heat probe minimally perturbs the junction's equilibrium, shedding light on features not visible in charge transport. we find that the josephson critical current completely vanishes in dc charge transport measurement, and the junction demonstrates coulomb blockade in agreement with the theory. surprisingly, thermal transport measurements show that the josephson junction acts as an inductor at high frequencies, unambiguously demonstrating that a supercurrent survives despite the coulomb blockade observed in dc measurements. the discrepancy between these two measurements highlights the difference between the low and the high frequency response of a junction and calls for further theoretical and experimental inputs on the dynamics of josephson junctions \textcolor{black}{operating at high frequencies in highly resistive environments."
