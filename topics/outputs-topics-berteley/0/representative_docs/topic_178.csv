"local optical chirality induced by near-field mode interference in achiral plasmonic metamolecules. when circularly polarized light interacts with a nanostructure, the optical response depends on the geometry of the structure. if the nanostructure is chiral (i.e., it cannot be superimposed on its mirror image), then its optical response, both in near-field and far-field, depends on the handedness of the incident light. in contrast, achiral structures exhibit identical far-field responses for left- and right-circular polarization. here, we show that a perfectly achiral nanostructure, a plasmonic metamolecule with trigonal d3h symmetry, exhibits a near-field response that is sensitive to the handedness of light. this effect stems from the near-field interference between the different plasmonic modes sustained by the plasmonic metamolecule under circularly polarized light excitation. the local chirality in a plasmonic trimer is then experimentally evidenced with nanoscale resolution using a molecular probe. our experiments demonstrate that the optical near-field chirality can be imprinted into the photosensitive polymer, turning an optical chirality into a geometrical chirality that can be imaged using atomic force microscopy. these results are of interest for the field of polarization-sensitive photochemistry."
"quantitatively analyzing intrinsic plasmonic chirality by tracking the interplay of electric and magnetic dipole modes. plasmonic chirality exhibits great potential for novel nanooptical devices due to the generation of a strong chiroptical response. previous reports on plasmonic chirality explanations are mainly based on phase retardation and coupling. we propose a quantitative model similar to the chiral molecules for explaining the mechanism of the intrinsic plasmonic chirality quantitatively based on the interplay and mixing of electric and magnetic dipole modes, which forms a mixed electric and magnetic polarizability. the analysis method is also suitable for small chiral object down to quasi-static limit without phase delay and expected to be a universal rule."
"broadband enhanced chirality with tunable response in hybrid plasmonic helical metamaterials. designing broadband enhanced chirality is of strong interest to the emerging fields of chiral chemistry and sensing, or to control the spin orbital momentum of photons in recently introduced nanophotonic chiral quantum and classical optical applications. however, chiral light-matter interactions have an extremely weak nature, are difficult to be controlled and enhanced, and cannot be made tunable or broadband. in addition, planar ultrathin nanophotonic structures to achieve strong, broadband, and tunable chirality at the technologically important visible to ultraviolet spectrum still remain elusive. here, we tackle these important problems by experimentally demonstrating and theoretically verifying spectrally tunable, extremely large, and broadband chiroptical response by nanohelical metamaterials. the reported new designs of all-dielectric and dielectric-metallic (hybrid) plasmonic metamaterials permit the largest and broadest ever measured chiral kuhn dissymmetry factor achieved by a large-scale nanophotonic structure. in addition, the strong circular dichroism of the presented bottom-up fabricated optical metamaterials can be tuned by varying their dimensions and proportions between their dielectric and plasmonic helical subsections. the currently demonstrated ultrathin optical metamaterials are expected to provide a substantial boost to the developing field of chiroptics leading to significantly enhanced and broadband chiral light-matter interactions at the nanoscale."
