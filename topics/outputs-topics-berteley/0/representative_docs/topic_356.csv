"flexible byzantine fault tolerance. this paper introduces flexible bft, a new approach for bft consensus solution design revolving around two pillars, stronger resilience and diversity. the first pillar, stronger resilience, involves a new fault model called alive-but-corrupt faults. alive-but-corrupt replicas may arbitrarily deviate from the protocol in an attempt to break safety of the protocol. however, if they cannot break safety, they will not try to prevent liveness of the protocol. combining alive-but-corrupt faults into the model, flexible bft is resilient to higher corruption levels than possible in a pure byzantine fault model. the second pillar, diversity, designs consensus solutions whose protocol transcript is used to draw different commit decisions under diverse beliefs. with this separation, the same flexible bft solution supports synchronous and asynchronous beliefs, as well as varying resilience threshold combinations of byzantine and alive-but-corrupt faults. at a technical level, flexible bft achieves the above results using two new ideas. first, it introduces a synchronous bft protocol in which only the commit step requires to know the network delay bound and thus replicas execute the protocol without any synchrony assumption. second, it introduces a notion called flexible byzantine quorums by dissecting the roles of different quorums in existing consensus protocols."
"scalable performance evaluation of byzantine fault-tolerant systems using network simulation. recent byzantine fault-tolerant (bft) state machine replication (smr) protocols increasingly focus on scalability to meet the requirements of distributed ledger technology (dlt). validating the performance of scalable bft protocol implementations requires careful evaluation. our solution uses network simulations to forecast the performance of bft protocols while experimentally scaling the environment. our method seamlessly plug-and-plays existing bft implementations into the simulation without requiring code modification or re-implementation, which is often time-consuming and error-prone. furthermore, our approach is also significantly cheaper than experiments with real large-scale cloud deployments. in this paper, we first explain our simulation architecture, which enables scalable performance evaluations of bft systems through high performance network simulations. we validate the accuracy of these simulations for predicting the performance of bft systems by comparing simulation results with measurements of real systems deployed on cloud infrastructures. we found that simulation results display a reasonable approximation at a larger system scale, because the network eventually becomes the dominating factor limiting system performance. in the second part of our paper, we use our simulation method to evaluate the performance of pbft and bft protocols from the blockchain generation, such as hotstuff and kauri, in large-scale and realistic wide-area network scenarios, as well as under induced faults."
"bft protocol forensics. byzantine fault-tolerant (bft) protocols allow a group of replicas to come to a consensus even when some of the replicas are byzantine faulty. there exist multiple bft protocols to securely tolerate an optimal number of faults $t$ under different network settings. however, if the number of faults $f$ exceeds $t$ then security could be violated. in this paper we mathematically formalize the study of forensic support of bft protocols: we aim to identify (with cryptographic integrity) as many of the malicious replicas as possible and in as a distributed manner as possible. our main result is that forensic support of bft protocols depends heavily on minor implementation details that do not affect the protocol's security or complexity. focusing on popular bft protocols (pbft, hotstuff, algorand) we exactly characterize their forensic support, showing that there exist minor variants of each protocol for which the forensic supports vary widely. we show strong forensic support capability of librabft, the consensus protocol of diem cryptocurrency; our lightweight forensic module implemented on a diem client is open-sourced and is under active consideration for deployment in diem. finally, we show that all secure bft protocols designed for $2t+1$ replicas communicating over a synchronous network forensic support are inherently nonexistent; this impossibility result holds for all bft protocols and even if one has access to the states of all replicas (including byzantine ones)."
