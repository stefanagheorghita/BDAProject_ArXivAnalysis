"capacity-achievability of polar codes and precoded polar codes under list decoding: they are good both practically and theoretically. polar codes under successive cancellation decoding proposed by ar{\i}kan provably achieve the symmetric capacity of any given binary-input discrete memoryless channel. the successive cancellation list decoder for polar codes was described by tal and vardy as a generalization of the successive cancellation decoder of ar{\i}kan. the performance of the successive cancellation list decoder is encouraging in practice. in this paper, we formalize the successive cancellation list decoder in our notation and prove that polar codes under successive cancellation list decoding achieve the symmetric capacity of any given binary-input discrete memoryless channel in theory as well. we also formalize the polar codes with crc precoding of tal and vardy. in fact, we propose a family of more general codes, namely, precoded polar codes and prove that precoded polar codes under successive cancellation list decoding can achieve the symmetric capacity of any given binary-input discrete memoryless channel under some conditions."
"belief propagation list decoding of polar codes. we propose a belief propagation list (bpl) decoder with comparable performance to the successive cancellation list (scl) decoder of polar codes, which already achieves the maximum likelihood (ml) bound of polar codes for sufficiently large list size $l$. the proposed decoder is composed of multiple parallel independent belief propagation (bp) decoders based on differently permuted polar code factor graphs. a list of possible transmitted codewords is generated and the one closest to the received vector, in terms of euclidean distance, is picked. to the best of our knowledge, the proposed bpl decoder provides the best performance of plain polar codes under iterative decoding known so far. the proposed algorithm does not require any changes in the polar code structure itself, rendering the bpl into an alternative to the scl decoder, equipped with a soft output capability enabling, e.g., iterative detection and decoding to further improve performance. further benefits are lower decoding latency compared to the scl decoder and the possibility of high throughput implementations. additionally, we show that a different selection strategy of frozen bit positions can further enhance the error-rate performance of the proposed decoder."
"successive cancellation decoding of polar codes using stochastic computing. polar codes have emerged as the most favorable channel codes for their unique capacity-achieving property. to date, numerous works have been reported for efficient design of polar codes decoder. however, these prior efforts focused on design of polar decoders via deterministic computation, while the behavior of stochastic polar decoder, which can have potential advantages such as low complexity and strong error-resilience, has not been studied in existing literatures. this paper, for the first time, investigates polar decoding using stochastic logic. specifically, the commonly-used successive cancellation (sc) algorithm is reformulated into the stochastic form. several methods that can potentially improve decoding performance are discussed and analyzed. simulation results show that a stochastic sc decoder can achieve similar error-correcting performance as its deterministic counterpart. this work can pave the way for future hardware design of stochastic polar codes decoders."
