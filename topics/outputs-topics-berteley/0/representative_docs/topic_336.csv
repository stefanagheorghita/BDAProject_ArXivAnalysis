"expansion of an ultracold rydberg plasma. we report a systematic experimental and numerical study of the expansion of ultra-cold rydberg plasmas. specifically, we have measured the asymptotic expansion velocities, $v_0$, of ultra-cold neutral plasmas (unps) which evolve from cold, dense samples of rydberg rubidium atoms using ion time-of-flight spectroscopy. from this, we have obtained values for the effective initial plasma electron temperature, $t_{e,0} = m_{ion} v_0^2/k_b$ (where $m_{ion}$ is the rb$^+$ ion mass), as a function of the original rydberg atom density and binding energy, $e_{b,i}$. we have also simulated numerically the interaction of unps with a large reservoir of rydberg atoms to obtain data to compare with our experimental results. we find that for rydberg atom densities in the range $10^7 - 10^9$ cm$^{-3}$, for states with principal quantum number $n > 40$, $t_{e,0}$ is insensitive to the initial ionization mechanism which seeds the plasma. in addition, the quantity $k_b \, t_{e,0}$ is strongly correlated with the fraction of atoms which ionize, and is in the range $0.6 \times |e_{b,i}| \lesssim k_bt_{e,0} \lesssim 2.5 \times |e_{b,i}|$. on the other hand, plasmas from rydberg samples with $n \lesssim 40$ evolve with no significant additional ionization of the remaining atoms once a threshold number of ions has been established. the dominant interaction between the plasma electrons and the rydberg atoms is one in which the atoms are deexcited, a heating process for electrons that competes with adiabatic cooling to establish an equilibrium where $t_{e,0}$ is determined by their coulomb coupling parameter, $\gamma_e \sim 0.01$."
"probing dipolar interactions between rydberg atoms and ultracold polar molecules. we probe resonant dipolar interactions between ultracold $^{40}$k$^{87}$rb molecules and rydberg $^{87}$rb atoms in an optically trapped ensemble. through state-selective ionization detection of the krb molecules, we observe resonant energy transfer at 2.227 ghz from rydberg atoms to molecules under a tunable external electric field. we measure a broadening up to 3.5 mhz, for the rb rydberg excitation spectrum, which matches a monte carlo simulation that describes a rydberg atom and neighboring molecules evolving under a dipole-dipole interacting hamiltonian. the demonstrated interspecies dipolar interaction is a key ingredient for hybrid rydberg-polar molecule systems, where the advantages of each system can be leveraged and combined."
"ionization of rydberg atoms embedded in an ultracold plasma. we have studied the behavior of cold rydberg atoms embedded in an ultracold plasma. we demonstrate that even deeply bound rydberg atoms are completely ionized in such an environment, due to electron collisions. using a fast pulse extraction of the electrons from the plasma we found that the number of excess positive charges, which is directly related to the electron temperature te, is not strongly affected by the ionization of the rydberg atoms. assuming a michie-king equilibrium distribution, in analogy with globular star cluster dynamics, we estimate te. without concluding on heating or cooling of the plasma by the rydberg atoms, we discuss the range for changing the plasma temperature by adding rydberg atoms."
