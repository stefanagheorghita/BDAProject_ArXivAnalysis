"gene function prediction with gene interaction networks: a context graph kernel approach. predicting gene functions is a challenge for biologists in the post genomic era. interactions among genes and their products compose networks that can be used to infer gene functions. most previous studies adopt a linkage assumption, i.e., they assume that gene interactions indicate functional similarities between connected genes. in this study, we propose to use a gene's context graph, i.e., the gene interaction network associated with the focal gene, to infer its functions. in a kernel-based machine-learning framework, we design a context graph kernel to capture the information in context graphs. our experimental study on a testbed of p53-related genes demonstrates the advantage of using indirect gene interactions and shows the empirical superiority of the proposed approach over linkage-assumption-based methods, such as the algorithm to minimize inconsistent connected genes and diffusion kernels."
"inferring genetic networks: an information theoretic approach. in the postgenome era many efforts have been dedicated to systematically elucidate the complex web of interacting genes and proteins. these efforts include experimental and computational methods. microarray technology offers an opportunity for monitoring gene expression level at the genome scale. by recourse to information theory, this study proposes a mathematical approach to reconstruct gene regulatory networks at coarse-grain level from high throughput gene expression data. the method provides the {\it a posteriori} probability that a given gene regulates positively, negatively or does not regulate each one of the network genes. this approach also allows the introduction of prior knowledge and the quantification of the information gain from experimental data used in the inference procedure. this information gain can be used to chose genes to be perturbed in subsequent experiments in order to refine the knowledge about the architecture of an underlying gene regulatory network. the performance of the proposed approach has been studied by {\it in numero} experiments. our results suggest that the approach is suitable for focusing on size-limited problems, such as, recovering a small subnetwork of interest by performing perturbation over selected genes."
"enhanced single-cell rna-seq embedding through gene expression and data-driven gene-gene interaction integration. single-cell rna sequencing (scrna-seq) provides unprecedented insights into cellular heterogeneity, enabling detailed analysis of complex biological systems at single-cell resolution. however, the high dimensionality and technical noise inherent in scrna-seq data pose significant analytical challenges. while current embedding methods focus primarily on gene expression levels, they often overlook crucial gene-gene interactions that govern cellular identity and function. to address this limitation, we present a novel embedding approach that integrates both gene expression profiles and data-driven gene-gene interactions. our method first constructs a cell-leaf graph (clg) using random forest models to capture regulatory relationships between genes, while simultaneously building a k-nearest neighbor graph (knng) to represent expression similarities between cells. these graphs are then combined into an enriched cell-leaf graph (eclg), which serves as input for a graph neural network to compute cell embeddings. by incorporating both expression levels and gene-gene interactions, our approach provides a more comprehensive representation of cellular states. extensive evaluation across multiple datasets demonstrates that our method enhances the detection of rare cell populations and improves downstream analyses such as visualization, clustering, and trajectory inference. this integrated approach represents a significant advance in single-cell data analysis, offering a more complete framework for understanding cellular diversity and dynamics."
