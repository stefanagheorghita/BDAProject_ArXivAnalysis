"modeling censored mobility demand through quantile regression neural networks. shared mobility services require accurate demand models for effective service planning. on the one hand, modeling the full probability distribution of demand is advantageous because the entire uncertainty structure preserves valuable information for decision-making. on the other hand, demand is often observed through the usage of the service itself, so that the observations are censored, as they are inherently limited by available supply. since the 1980s, various works on censored quantile regression models have performed well under such conditions. further, in the last two decades, several papers have proposed to implement these models flexibly through neural networks. however, the models in current works estimate the quantiles individually, thus incurring a computational overhead and ignoring valuable relationships between the quantiles. we address this gap by extending current censored quantile regression models to learn multiple quantiles at once and apply these to synthetic baseline datasets and datasets from two shared mobility providers in the copenhagen metropolitan area in denmark. the results show that our extended models yield fewer quantile crossings and less computational overhead without compromising model performance."
"long-term prediction intervals with many covariates. accurate forecasting is one of the fundamental focus in the literature of econometric time-series. often practitioners and policy makers want to predict outcomes of an entire time horizon in the future instead of just a single $k$-step ahead prediction. these series, apart from their own possible non-linear dependence, are often also influenced by many external predictors. in this paper, we construct prediction intervals of time-aggregated forecasts in a high-dimensional regression setting. our approach is based on quantiles of residuals obtained by the popular lasso routine. we allow for general heavy-tailed, long-memory, and nonlinear stationary error process and stochastic predictors. through a series of systematically arranged consistency results we provide theoretical guarantees of our proposed quantile-based method in all of these scenarios. after validating our approach using simulations we also propose a novel bootstrap based method that can boost the coverage of the theoretical intervals. finally analyzing the epex spot data, we construct prediction intervals for hourly electricity prices over horizons spanning 17 weeks and contrast them to selected bayesian and bootstrap interval forecasts."
"quantile forecast matching with a bayesian quantile gaussian process model. a set of probabilities along with corresponding quantiles are often used to define predictive distributions or probabilistic forecasts. these quantile predictions offer easily interpreted uncertainty of an event, and quantiles are generally straightforward to estimate using standard statistical and machine learning methods. however, compared to a distribution defined by a probability density or cumulative distribution function, a set of quantiles has less distributional information. when given estimated quantiles, it may be desirable to estimate a fully defined continuous distribution function. many researchers do so to make evaluation or ensemble modeling simpler. most existing methods for fitting a distribution to quantiles lack accurate representation of the inherent uncertainty from quantile estimation or are limited in their applications. in this manuscript, we present a gaussian process model, the quantile gaussian process, which is based on established theory of quantile functions and sample quantiles, to construct a probability distribution given estimated quantiles. a bayesian application of the quantile gaussian process is evaluated for parameter inference and distribution approximation in simulation studies. the quantile gaussian process is used to approximate the distributions of quantile forecasts from the 2023-24 us centers for disease control collaborative flu forecasting initiative. the simulation studies and data analysis show that the quantile gaussian process leads to accurate inference on model parameters, estimation of a continuous distribution, and uncertainty quantification of sample quantiles."
