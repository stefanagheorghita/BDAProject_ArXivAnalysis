"perturbative calculation of energy levels for the dirac equation with generalised momenta. we analyse a modified dirac equation based on a noncommutative structure in phase space. the noncommutative structure induces generalised momenta and contributions to the energy levels of the standard dirac equation. using techniques of perturbation theory, we use this approach to find the lowest order corrections to the energy levels and eigenfunctions for two linear potentials in three dimensions, one with radial dependence and another with a triangular shape along one spatial dimension. we find that the corrections due to the noncommutative contributions may be of the same order as the relativistic ones."
"the phase-space noncommutativity effect on the large and small wavefunction components approach at dirac equation. by the large and small wave-function components approach we achieved the nonrela-tivistic limit of the dirac equation in interaction with an electromagnetic potential in noncommutative phase-space, and we tested the effect of the phase-space noncommutativity on it, knowing that the nonrelativistic limit of the dirac equation gives the schr\""odinger-pauli equation."
"dirac equation with vector and scalar potentials via supersymmetry in quantum mechanics. in this work, a spin $\frac 12$ relativistic particle described by a generalized potential containing both the coulomb potential and a lorentz scalar potential in dirac equation is investigated in terms of the generalized ladder operators from supersymmetry in quantum mechanics. this formalism is applied for the generalized dirac-coulomb problem, which is an exactly solvable potential in relativistic quantum mechanics. we obtain the energy eigenvalues and calculate explicitly the energy eigenfunctions for the ground state and the first excited state."
