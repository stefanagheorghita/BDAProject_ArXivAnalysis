"a mathematical and numerical framework for ultrasonically-induced lorentz force electrical impedance tomography. we provide a mathematical analysis and a numerical framework for lorentz force electrical conductivity imaging. ultrasonic vibration of a tissue in the presence of a static magnetic field induces an electrical current by the lorentz force. this current can be detected by electrodes placed around the tissue; it is proportional to the velocity of the ultrasonic pulse, but depends nonlinearly on the conductivity distribution. the imaging problem is to reconstruct the conductivity distribution from measurements of the induced current. to solve this nonlinear inverse problem, we first make use of a virtual potential to relate explicitly the current measurements to the conductivity distribution and the velocity of the ultrasonic pulse. then, by applying a wiener filter to the measured data, we reduce the problem to imaging the conductivity from an internal electric current density. we first introduce an optimal control method for solving such a problem. a new direct reconstruction scheme involving a partial differential equation is then proposed based on viscosity-type regularization to a transport equation satisfied by the current density field. we prove that solving such an equation yields the true conductivity distribution as the regularization parameter approaches zero. we also test both schemes numerically in the presence of measurement noise, quantify their stability and resolution, and compare their performance."
"3d reconstruction for partial data electrical impedance tomography using a sparsity prior. in electrical impedance tomography the electrical conductivity inside a physical body is computed from electro-static boundary measurements. the focus of this paper is to extend recent result for the 2d problem to 3d. prior information about the sparsity and spatial distribution of the conductivity is used to improve reconstructions for the partial data problem with cauchy data measured only on a subset of the boundary. a sparsity prior is enforced using the $\ell_1$ norm in the penalty term of a tikhonov functional, and spatial prior information is incorporated by applying a spatially distributed regularization parameter. the optimization problem is solved numerically using a generalized conditional gradient method with soft thresholding. numerical examples show the effectiveness of the suggested method even for the partial data problem with measurements affected by noise."
identification of an inclusion in multifrequency electric impedance tomography. the multifrequency electrical impedance tomography is considered in order to image a conductivity inclusion inside a homogeneous background medium by injecting one current. an original spectral decomposition of the solution of the forward conductivity problem is used to retrieve the cauchy data corresponding to the extreme case of perfect conductor. using results based on the unique continuation we then prove the uniqueness of multifrequency electrical impedance tomography and obtain rigorous stability estimates. our results in this paper are quite surprising in inverse conductivity problem since in general infinitely many input currents are needed in order to obtain the uniqueness in the determination of the conductivity.
