"shot noise in mesoscopic systems. this is a review of shot noise, the time-dependent fluctuations in the electrical current due to the discreteness of the electron charge, in small conductors. the shot-noise power can be smaller than that of a poisson process as a result of correlations in the electron transmission imposed by the pauli principle. this suppression takes on simple universal values in a symmetric double-barrier junction (suppression factor 1/2), a disordered metal (factor 1/3), and a chaotic cavity (factor 1/4). loss of phase coherence has no effect on this shot-noise suppression, while thermalization of the electrons due to electron-electron scattering increases the shot noise slightly. sub-poissonian shot noise has been observed experimentally. so far unobserved phenomena involve the interplay of shot noise with the aharonov-bohm effect, andreev reflection, and the fractional quantum hall effect."
"long-range coulomb interaction and the crossover between quantum and shot noise in diffusive conductors. frequency-dependent nonequilibrium noise in quantum-coherent diffusive conductors is calculated with account taken of long-range coulomb interaction. for long and narrow contacts with strong external screening the crossover between quantum and shot noise takes place at frequencies much smaller than the voltage drop across the contact. we also show that under certain frequency limitations, the semiclassical and quantum-coherent approaches to shot noise are mathematically equivalent."
"current noise, electron-electron interactions, and quantum interference. it is shown that electron-electron interactions lead to a novel quantum-interference contribution to non-equilibrium current noise in mesoscopic conductors. the corresponding noise spectrum is obtained in detail for diffusive systems. it is found to be quadratic in the applied voltage and to exhibit a power-law frequency spectrum whose exponent depends on the dimensionality of the sample."
