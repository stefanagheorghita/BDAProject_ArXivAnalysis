"an analytical treatment of the clock paradox in the framework of the special and general theories of relativity. in this paper we treat the so called clock paradox in an analytical way by assuming that a constant and uniform force f of finite magnitude acts continuously on the moving clock along the direction of its motion assumed to be rectilinear. no inertial motion steps are considered. the rest clock is denoted as (1), the to-and-fro moving clock is (2), the inertial frame in which (1) is at rest in its origin and (2) is seen moving is i and, finally, the accelerated frame in which (2) is at rest in its origin and (1) moves forward and backward is a. we deal with the following questions: i) what is the effect of the finite force acting on (2) on the proper time intervals measured by the two clocks when they reunite? does a differential aging between the two clocks occur, as it happens when inertial motion and infinite values of the accelerating force is considered? the special theory of relativity is used in order to describe the hyperbolic motion of (2) in the frame i ii) is this effect an absolute one, i.e. does the accelerated observer a comoving with (2) obtain the same results as that in i, both qualitatively and quantitatively, as it is expected? we use the general theory of relativity in order to answer this question."
"unifying relativity and classical dynamics. relativity and classical dynamics, as defined so far, form distinct parts of classical physics and are formulated based on independent principles. we propose that the formalism of classical dynamics can be considered as the theoretical foundation of the current theory of relativity and may be employed for exploring possibilities beyond the current theory. we show that special-relativistic kinematics, including universality of the speed of massless particles relative to inertial frames, is a consequence of the formalism of classical dynamics, with no assumptions other than spacetime point transformations and euclidean geometry of space in inertial frames. we discuss that energy-independent velocity is a general concept in classical dynamics, applicable even to massive objects, in appropriate canonical coordinates. the derivation of lorentz symmetry is inherently local and allows the speed of massless particles (relative to local inertial frames) to vary with space and time globally, which may provide a theoretical foundation for variable speed of light cosmology. we obtain no kinematical scales other than the light-speed, specially no scale of energy or momentum as has been suggested in some quantum gravity investigations. we argue that this is a consequence of spacetime point transformations making the momentum space linear, and a possible second scale must require non-point transformations as a necessary condition, which seems compatible with the notion of relative locality in curved momentum space."
"doubly special relativity: a new relativity or not?. double special relativity theories are the relativistic theories in which the transformations between inertial observers are characterized by two observer-independent scales of the light speed and the planck length. we study two main examples of these theories and want to show that these theories are not the new theories of relativity, but only are re-descriptions of einstein's special relativity in the non-conventional coordinates."
