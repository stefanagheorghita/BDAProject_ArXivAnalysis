"scaffolding metacognition in programming education: understanding student-ai interactions and design implications. generative ai tools such as chatgpt now provide novice programmers with unprecedented access to instant, personalized support. while this holds clear promise, their influence on students' metacognitive processes remains underexplored. existing work has largely focused on correctness and usability, with limited attention to whether and how students' use of ai assistants supports or bypasses key metacognitive processes. this study addresses that gap by analyzing student-ai interactions through a metacognitive lens in university-level programming courses. we examined more than 10,000 dialogue logs collected over three years, complemented by surveys of students and educators. our analysis focused on how prompts and responses aligned with metacognitive phases and strategies. synthesizing these findings across data sources, we distill design considerations for ai-powered coding assistants that aim to support rather than supplant metacognitive engagement. our findings provide guidance for developing educational ai tools that strengthen students' learning processes in programming education."
"evaluating ai-powered learning assistants in engineering higher education: student engagement, ethical challenges, and policy implications. as generative ai becomes increasingly integrated into higher education, understanding how students engage with these technologies is essential for responsible adoption. this study evaluates the educational ai hub, an ai-powered learning framework, implemented in undergraduate civil and environmental engineering courses at a large r1 public university. using a mixed-methods design combining pre- and post-surveys, system usage logs, and qualitative analysis of students' ai interactions, the research examines perceptions of trust, ethics, usability, and learning outcomes. findings show that students valued the ai assistant for its accessibility and comfort, with nearly half reporting greater ease using it than seeking help from instructors or teaching assistants. the tool was most helpful for completing homework and understanding concepts, though views on its instructional quality were mixed. ethical uncertainty, particularly around institutional policy and academic integrity, emerged as a key barrier to full engagement. overall, students regarded ai as a supplement rather than a replacement for human instruction. the study highlights the importance of usability, ethical transparency, and faculty guidance in promoting meaningful ai engagement. a total of 71 students participated across two courses, generating over 600 ai interactions and 100 survey responses that provided both quantitative and contextual insights into learning engagement."
"exploring the use of chatgpt as a tool for learning and assessment in undergraduate computer science curriculum: opportunities and challenges. the application of artificial intelligence for teaching and learning in the academic sphere is a trending subject of interest in the computing education. chatgpt, as an ai-based tool, provides various advantages, such as heightened student involvement, cooperation, accessibility and availability. this paper addresses the prospects and obstacles associated with utilizing chatgpt as a tool for learning and assessment in undergraduate computer science curriculum in particular to teaching and learning fundamental programming courses. students having completed the course work for a data structures and algorithms (a sophomore level course) participated in this study. two groups of students were given programming challenges to solve within a short period of time. the control group (group a) had access to text books and notes of programming courses, however no internet access was provided. group b students were given access to chatgpt and were encouraged to use it to help solve the programming challenges. the challenge was conducted in a computer lab environment using pc2 environment. each team of students address the problem by writing executable code that satisfies certain number of test cases. student teams were scored based on their performance in terms of number of successful passed testcases. results show that students using chatgpt had an advantage in terms of earned scores, however there were inconsistencies and inaccuracies in the submitted code consequently affecting the overall performance. after a thorough analysis, the paper's findings indicate that incorporating ai in higher education brings about various opportunities and challenges."
