"on the power of quantum entanglement in multipartite quantum xor games. in this paper we show that, given $k\geq 3$, there exist $k$-player quantum xor games for which the entangled bias can be arbitrarily larger than the bias of the game when the players are restricted to separable strategies. in particular, quantum entanglement can be a much more powerful resource than local operations and classical communication to play these games. this result shows a strong contrast to the bipartite case, where it was recently proved that the entangled bias is always upper bounded by a universal constant times the one-way classical communication bias."
"quantum games via search algorithms. we build new quantum games, similar to the spin flip game, where as a novelty the players perform measurements on a quantum system associated to a continuous time search algorithm. the measurements collapse the wave function into one of the two possible states. these games are characterized by a continuous space of strategies and the selection of a particular strategy is determined by the moments when the players measure."
"a necessary and sufficient condition to play games in quantum mechanical settings. quantum game theory is a multidisciplinary field which combines quantum mechanics with game theory by introducing non-classical resources such as entanglement, quantum operations and quantum measurement. by transferring two-player-two strategy (2x2) dilemma containing classical games into quantum realm, dilemmas can be resolved in quantum pure strategies if entanglement is distributed between the players who use quantum operations. moreover, players receive the highest sum of payoffs available in the game, which are otherwise impossible in classical pure strategies. encouraged by the observation of rich dynamics of physical systems with many interacting parties and the power of entanglement in quantum versions of 2x2 games, it became generally accepted that quantum versions can be easily extended to n-player situations by simply allowing n-partite entangled states. in this article, however, we show that this is not generally true because the reproducibility of classical tasks in quantum domain imposes limitations on the type of entanglement and quantum operators. we propose a benchmark for the evaluation of quantum and classical versions of games, and derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for a physical realization. we give examples of entangled states that can and cannot be used, and the characteristics of quantum operators used as strategies."
