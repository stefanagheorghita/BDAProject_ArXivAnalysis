"is there a $c$-function in 4d quantum einstein gravity?. we describe a functional renormalization group-based method to search for `$c$-like' functions with properties similar to that in 2d conformal field theory. it exploits the mode counting properties of the effective average action and is particularly suited for theories including quantized gravity. the viability of the approach is demonstrated explicitly in a truncation of 4 dimensional quantum einstein gravity, i.e. asymptotically safe metric gravity."
"aspects of $(d+d)$-dimensional anisotropic conformal gravity. we discuss various aspects of anisotropic gravity in $(d+d)$-dimensional spacetime where $d$ dimensions are treated as extra dimensions. it is based on the foliation preserving diffeomorphism invariance and anisotropic conformal invariance. the anisotropy is embodied by introducing a factor $z$ which discriminates the scaling degree of the extra $d$ dimensions against the $d$-dimensional base spacetime and weyl scalar field which mediates the anisotropic scaling symmetry. there is no intrinsic scale but a physical scale $m_*$ emerges as a consequence of spontaneous conformal symmetry breaking. some vacuum solutions are obtained and we discuss an issue of `size separation' between the base spacetime and the extra dimensions. the size separation means large hierarchy between the scales appearing in the base spacetime and the extra dimensions respectively. we also discuss interesting theories obtained from our model. in the case of (4,1), we propose a resolution of hierarchy problem and discuss comparison with the results of the brane-world model. in a $(d,d)=(2,2)$ case, we suggest a uv-complete unitary quantum gravity which might become einstein gravity in ir. in a certain (2,1) case, we obtain cghs-model."
"closing the gaps in quantum space and time: conformally augmented gauge structure of gravitation. a new framework of loop quantization that assimilates conformal and scale invariance is constructed and is found to be applicable to a large class of physically important theories of gravity and gravity-matter systems. they include general relativity and scale-invariant scalar-tensor and dilaton theories. consequently, matter to be coupled to such theories is restricted to be conformal or scale invariant. standard model-type systems naturally fall into this category. the new loop quantization follows from a novel conformally generalized holst action principle. in contrast to standard loop quantum gravity, the resulting quantum geometry is not beset by the immirzi ambiguity and has no definitive area gaps within the considered large class of theories of gravitation. as an additional feature, the scale invariance gives rise to a conserved weyl current and we discuss briefly its possible implication on the problem of time in quantum gravity."
