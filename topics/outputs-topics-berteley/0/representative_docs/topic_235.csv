"neutralino dark matter in the left-right supersymmetric model. we study the neutralino sector of the left-right supersymmetric model. in addition to the possibilities available in the minimal supersymmetric model, the neutralino states can be superpartners of the u(1)_{b-l} gauge boson, the neutral su(2)_r neutral gauge boson, or of the higgs triplets. we analyze neutralino masses and determine the parameter regions for which the lightest neutralino can be one of the new pure states. we then calculate the relic density of the dark matter for each of these states and impose the constraints coming from the rho parameter, the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, b -> s gamma, as well as general supersymmetric mass bounds. the lightest neutralino can be the bino, or the right-wino, or the neutral triplet higgsino, all of which have different couplings to the standard model particles from the usual neutralinos. a light bino satisfies all the experimental constraints and would be the preferred dark matter candidate for light supersymmetric scalar masses, while the right-wino would be favored by intermediate supersymmetric mass scales. the neutral triplet higgs fermion satisfies the experimental bounds only in a small region of the parameter space, for intermediate to heavy supersymmetric scalar masses."
"lep constraints on neutralino relic densities, and the fate of higgsino dark matter. we examine the current state of neutralino dark matter and consider how the lep constraints on the minimal supersymmetric standard model parameters are squeezing the available dark matter regions. we also show how cosmological constraints augment bounds coming from collider searches to further constrain the mssm parameter space."
"vector dark matter and lhc constraints, including a 95 gev light higgs boson. we study lhc searches for an extension of the standard model (sm) by exploiting an additional abelian $u_d(1)$ gauge symmetry and a complex scalar higgs portal. as the scalar is charged under this gauge symmetry, a vector dark matter (vdm) candidate can satisfy the observed relic abundance and limits from direct dark matter (dm) searches. the atlas and cms experiments have developed a broad search program for the dm candidates, including associate production of higgs boson, $z$ boson, and top quark that couple to dm. in this paper, we perform an extensive analysis to constrain the model by using these experiments at lhc. it can be seen that the lhc results can exclude some parts of the parameter space that are still allowed by relic density and the direct detection searches. using the lhc results, all scalar higgs portal masses are excluded for the light vdm. furthermore, exclusion limits on the parameter space of the model by using the new results of the cms and atlas collaborations for a new light higgs boson with mass $\sim95~\rm gev$ are provided."
