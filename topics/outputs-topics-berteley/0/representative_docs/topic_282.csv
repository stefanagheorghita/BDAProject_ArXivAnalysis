effective theories of quantum cosmology. we introduce two possible ways of defining effective constraints of quantum systems and applied this effective constraint method to models of wdw quantum cosmology and loop quantum cosmology. we analyze effective hamiltonian constraint on both second and third order and calculate hubble parameter as well as modified friedmann equation of each model. then we compare with a special case using coherent state. it shows that this method is reasonable and as before the classical big bang singularity is replaced by a quantum bounce in loop quantum cosmology.
"bouncing universe in loop quantum gravity: full theory calculation. in loop quantum gravity mathematically rigorous models of full quantum gravity were proposed. in this paper we study a cosmological sector of one of the models describing quantum gravity with positive cosmological constant coupled to massless scalar field. in our previous research we introduced a method to reduce the model to homogeneous-isotropic sector at the quantum level. in this paper we propose a method to restrict to the spatially flat sector. after this restriction the number of degrees of freedom gets substantially reduced. this allows us to make numerical calculations. remarkably, the resulting model shares some structural similarities with the loop quantum cosmological models and therefore sheds some new light on the relation between loop quantum gravity and loop quantum cosmology. according to our model the evolution of the universe is periodic. the quantum gravity effects resolve the big bang singularity leading to a big bounce and cause the universe to contract after a classical expansion phase (big crunch)."
"hybrid loop quantum cosmology: an overview. loop quantum gravity is a nonperturbative and background independent program for the quantization of general relativity. its underlying formalism has been applied successfully to the study of cosmological spacetimes, both to test the principles and techniques of the theory and to discuss its physical consequences. these applications have opened a new area of research known as loop quantum cosmology. the hybrid approach addresses the quantization of cosmological systems that include fields. this proposal combines the description of a finite number of degrees of freedom using loop quantum cosmology, typically corresponding to a homogeneous background, and a fock quantization of the field content of the model. in this review we first present a summary of the foundations of homogeneous loop quantum cosmology and we then revisit the hybrid quantization approach, applying it to the study of gowdy spacetimes with linearly polarized gravitational waves on toroidal spatial sections, and to the analysis of cosmological perturbations in preinflationary and inflationary stages of the universe. the main challenge is to extract predictions about quantum geometry effects that eventually might be confronted with cosmological observations. this is the first extensive review of the hybrid approach in the literature on loop quantum cosmology."
