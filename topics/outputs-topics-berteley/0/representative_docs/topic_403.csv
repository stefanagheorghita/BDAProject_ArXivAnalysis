"distinguishing tor from other encrypted network traffic through character analysis. for journalists reporting from a totalitarian regime, whistleblowers and resistance fighters, the anonymous use of cloud services on the internet can be vital for survival. the tor network provides a free and widely used anonymization service for everyone. however, there are different approaches to distinguishing tor from non-tor encrypted network traffic, most recently only due to the (relative) frequencies of hex digits in a single encrypted payload packet. while conventional data traffic is usually encrypted once, but at least three times in the case of tor due to the structure and principle of the tor network, we have examined to what extent the number of encryptions contributes to being able to distinguish tor from non-tor encrypted data traffic."
"avoiding the man on the wire: improving tor's security with trust-aware path selection. tor users are vulnerable to deanonymization by an adversary that can observe some tor relays or some parts of the network. we demonstrate that previous network-aware path-selection algorithms that propose to solve this problem are vulnerable to attacks across multiple tor connections. we suggest that users use trust to choose the paths through tor that are less likely to be observed, where trust is flexibly modeled as a probability distribution on the location of the user's adversaries, and we present the trust-aware path selection algorithm for tor that helps users avoid traffic-analysis attacks while still choosing paths that could have been selected by many other users. we evaluate this algorithm in two settings using a high-level map of internet routing: (i) users try to avoid a single global adversary that has an independent chance to control each autonomous system organization, internet exchange point organization, and tor relay family, and (ii) users try to avoid deanonymization by any single country. we also examine the performance of trust-aware path selection using the shadow network simulator."
"dns-morph: udp-based bootstrapping protocol for tor. tor is one of the most popular systems for anonymous communication and censorship circumvention on the web, currently used by millions of users every day. this puts tor as a target for attacks by organizations and governmental bodies whose goal is to hinder users' ability to connect to it. these attacks include deep packet inspection (dpi) to classify tor traffic as well as legitimate tor client impersonation (active probing) to expose tor bridges. as a response to tor-blocking attempts, the tor community has developed pluggable transports (pts), tools that transform the appearance of tor's traffic flow. in this paper we introduce a new approach aiming to enhance the pt's resistance against active probing attacks, as well as white-listing censorship by partitioning the handshake of the pt from its encrypted communication. thus, allowing mixing different pts, e.g., scramblesuit for the handshake and fte for the traffic itself. we claim that this separation reduces the possibility of marking tor related communications. to illustrate our claim, we introduce dns-morph: a new method of transforming the handshake data of a pt by imitating a sequence of dns queries and responses. using dns-morph, the tor client acts as a dns client which sends dns queries to the tor bridge, and receives dns responses from it. we implemented and successfully tested dns-morph using one of the pts (scramblesuit), and verified its capabilities."
