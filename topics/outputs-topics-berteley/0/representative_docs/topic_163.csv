"potential scaling in density functional theory. density scaling has a rich history in density functional theory, providing exact conditions for use in the construction of ever more accurate approximations to the unknown exchange-correlation functional. we define a conjugate potential scaling for each density scaling. this provides exact relations on various important density functionals, in particular, relating functionals evaluated on exact densities of different potentials. we illustrate these conditions on the two- and four-electron ion series."
"meta-gga density functional calculations on atoms with spherically symmetric densities in the finite element formalism. density functional calculations on atoms are often used for determining accurate initial guesses as well as generating various types of pseudopotential approximations and efficient atomic-orbital basis sets for polyatomic calculations. to reach the best accuracy for these purposes, the atomic calculations should employ the same density functional as the polyatomic calculation. atomic density functional calculations are typically carried out employing spherically symmetric densities, corresponding to the use of fractional orbital occupations. we have described their implementation for density functional approximations (dfas) belonging to the local density approximation (lda) and generalized gradient approximation (gga) levels of theory as well as hartree-fock (hf) and range-separated exact exchange [s. lehtola, phys. rev. a 2020, 101, 012516]. in this work, we describe the extension to meta-gga functionals using the generalized kohn-sham scheme, in which the energy is minimized with respect to the orbitals, which in turn are expanded in the finite element formalism with high-order numerical basis functions. furnished with the new implementation, we continue our recent work on the numerical well-behavedness of recent meta-gga functionals [s. lehtola and m. a. l. marques, j. chem. phys. 2022, 157, 174114]. we pursue complete basis set (cbs) limit energies for recent density functionals, and find many to be ill-behaved for the li and na atoms. we report basis set truncation errors (bstes) of some commonly used gaussian basis sets for these density functionals and find the bstes to be strongly functional dependent. we also discuss the importance of density thresholding in dfas and find that all of the functionals studied in this work yield total energies converged to $0.1\ \mu e_{h}$ when densities smaller than $10^{-11}a_{0}^{-3}$ are screened out."
"smart local orbitals for efficient calculations within density functional theory and beyond. localized basis sets in the projector augmented wave formalism allow for computationally efficient calculations within density functional theory (dft). however, achieving high numerical accuracy requires an extensive basis set, which also poses a fundamental problem for the interpretation of the results. we present a way to obtain a reduced basis set of atomic orbitals through the subdiagonalization of each atomic block of the hamiltonian. the resulting local orbitals (los) inherit the information of the local crystal field. in the lo basis, it becomes apparent that the hamiltonian is nearly block-diagonal, and we demonstrate that it is possible to keep only a subset of relevant los which provide an accurate description of the physics around the fermi level. this reduces to some extent the redundancy of the original basis set, and at the same time it allows one to perform post-processing of dft calculations, ranging from the interpretation of electron transport to extracting effective tight-binding hamiltonians, very efficiently and without sacrificing the accuracy of the results."
