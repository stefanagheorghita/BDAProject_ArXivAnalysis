"exponential decay of relaxation effects at laalo3/srtio3 heterointerfaces. we study the decay of interface induced structural and electronic relaxation effects in epitaxial laalo3/srtio3 heterostructures. the results are based on first-principles band structure calculations for a multilayer configuration with an ultrathin laalo3 layer sandwiched between bulk-like srtio3 layers. we carry out the structure optimization for the heterointerface and investigate the electronic states of the conducting interface layer, which is found to extend over two srtio3 unit cells. the decay of atomic displacements is analyzed as a function of the distance to the interface, and the resulting exponential law is evaluated quantitatively."
"unexpected anisotropic two dimensional electron gas at the laalo3/srtio3 (110) interface. the observation of a two dimensional electron gas (2deg) (1, 2), superconductivity (3, 4), magnetic effects (5) and electronic phase separation (6-8) at the interfaces of insulating oxides, especially laalo3/srtio3, has further enhanced the potential of complex oxides for novel electronics. the occurrence of the 2deg is strongly believed to be driven by the polarization discontinuity (9) at the interface between the two oxides. in this scenario, the crystal orientation plays an important role and no conductivity would be expected for e.g., the interface between laalo3 and (110)-oriented srtio3, which should not have a polarization discontinuity (10, 11). here, we report the observation of unexpected conductivity at the laalo3/srtio3 interface prepared on (110)-oriented srtio3. the conductivity was further found to be strongly anisotropic, with the ratio of the conductance along the different directions parallel to the substrate surface showing a remarkable dependence on the oxygen pressure during deposition. the conductance and its anisotropy are discussed based on the atomic structure at the interface, as revealed by scanning transmission electron microscopy (stem) and further supported by density functional theory (dft) calculations."
"tailoring a two-dimensional electron gas at the laalo3/srtio3 (001) interface by epitaxial strain. recently a metallic state was discovered at the interface between insulating oxides, most notably laalo3 and srtio3. properties of this two-dimensional electron gas (2deg) have attracted significant interest due to its potential applications in nanoelectronics. control over this carrier density and mobility of the 2deg is essential for applications of these novel systems, and may be achieved by epitaxial strain. however, despite the rich nature of strain effects on oxide materials properties, such as ferroelectricity, magnetism, and superconductivity, the relationship between the strain and electrical properties of the 2deg at the laalo3/srtio3 heterointerface remains largely unexplored. here, we use different lattice constant single crystal substrates to produce laalo3/srtio3 interfaces with controlled levels of biaxial epitaxial strain. we have found that tensile strained srtio3 destroys the conducting 2deg, while compressively strained srtio3 retains the 2deg, but with a carrier concentration reduced in comparison to the unstrained laalo3/srtio3 interface. we have also found that the critical laalo3 overlayer thickness for 2deg formation increases with srtio3 compressive strain. our first-principles calculations suggest that a strain-induced electric polarization in the srtio3 layer is responsible for this behavior. it is directed away from the interface and hence creates a negative polarization charge opposing that of the polar laalo3 layer. this both increases the critical thickness of the laalo3 layer, and reduces carrier concentration above the critical thickness, in agreement with our experimental results. our findings suggest that epitaxial strain can be used to tailor 2degs properties of the laalo3/srtio3 heterointerface."
