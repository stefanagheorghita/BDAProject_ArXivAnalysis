"normalized range voting broadly resists control. we study the behavior of range voting and normalized range voting with respect to electoral control. electoral control encompasses attempts from an election chair to alter the structure of an election in order to change the outcome. we show that a voting system resists a case of control by proving that performing that case of control is computationally infeasible. range voting is a natural extension of approval voting, and normalized range voting is a simple variant which alters each vote to maximize the potential impact of each voter. we show that normalized range voting has among the largest number of control resistances among natural voting systems."
"equilibria of plurality voting with abstentions. in the traditional voting manipulation literature, it is assumed that a group of manipulators jointly misrepresent their preferences to get a certain candidate elected, while the remaining voters are truthful. in this paper, we depart from this assumption, and consider the setting where all voters are strategic. in this case, the election can be viewed as a game, and the election outcomes correspond to nash equilibria of this game. we use this framework to analyze two variants of plurality voting, namely, simultaneous voting, where all voters submit their ballots at the same time, and sequential voting, where the voters express their preferences one by one. for simultaneous voting, we characterize the preference profiles that admit a pure nash equilibrium, but show that it is computationally hard to check if a given profile fits our criterion. for sequential voting, we provide a complete analysis of the setting with two candidates, and show that for three or more candidates the equilibria of sequential voting may behave in a counterintuitive manner."
"strategic voting under uncertainty about the voting method. much of the theoretical work on strategic voting makes strong assumptions about what voters know about the voting situation. a strategizing voter is typically assumed to know how other voters will vote and to know the rules of the voting method. a growing body of literature explores strategic voting when there is uncertainty about how others will vote. in this paper, we study strategic voting when there is uncertainty about the voting method. we introduce three notions of manipulability for a set of voting methods: sure, safe, and expected manipulability. with the help of a computer program, we identify voting scenarios in which uncertainty about the voting method may reduce or even eliminate a voter's incentive to misrepresent her preferences. thus, it may be in the interest of an election designer who wishes to reduce strategic voting to leave voters uncertain about which of several reasonable voting methods will be used to determine the winners of an election."
