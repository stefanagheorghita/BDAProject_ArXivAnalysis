"comparative study of eco and cfnet trackers in noisy environment. object tracking is one of the most challenging task and has secured significant attention of computer vision researchers in the past two decades. recent deep learning based trackers have shown good performance on various tracking challenges. a tracking method should track objects in sequential frames accurately in challenges such as deformation, low resolution, occlusion, scale and light variations. most trackers achieve good performance on specific challenges instead of all tracking problems, hence there is a lack of general purpose tracking algorithms that can perform well in all conditions. moreover, performance of tracking techniques has not been evaluated in noisy environments. visual object tracking has real world applications and there is good chance that noise may get added during image acquisition in surveillance cameras. we aim to study the robustness of two state of the art trackers in the presence of noise including efficient convolutional operators (eco) and correlation filter network (cfnet). our study demonstrates that the performance of these trackers degrades as the noise level increases, which demonstrate the need to design more robust tracking algorithms."
"transformers in single object tracking: an experimental survey. single-object tracking is a well-known and challenging research topic in computer vision. over the last two decades, numerous researchers have proposed various algorithms to solve this problem and achieved promising results. recently, transformer-based tracking approaches have ushered in a new era in single-object tracking by introducing new perspectives and achieving superior tracking robustness. in this paper, we conduct an in-depth literature analysis of transformer tracking approaches by categorizing them into cnn-transformer based trackers, two-stream two-stage fully-transformer based trackers, and one-stream one-stage fully-transformer based trackers. in addition, we conduct experimental evaluations to assess their tracking robustness and computational efficiency using publicly available benchmark datasets. furthermore, we measure their performances on different tracking scenarios to identify their strengths and weaknesses in particular situations. our survey provides insights into the underlying principles of transformer tracking approaches, the challenges they encounter, and the future directions they may take."
"deep reinforcement learning for visual object tracking in videos. in this paper we introduce a fully end-to-end approach for visual tracking in videos that learns to predict the bounding box locations of a target object at every frame. an important insight is that the tracking problem can be considered as a sequential decision-making process and historical semantics encode highly relevant information for future decisions. based on this intuition, we formulate our model as a recurrent convolutional neural network agent that interacts with a video overtime, and our model can be trained with reinforcement learning (rl) algorithms to learn good tracking policies that pay attention to continuous, inter-frame correlation and maximize tracking performance in the long run. the proposed tracking algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance in an existing tracking benchmark and operates at frame-rates faster than real-time. to the best of our knowledge, our tracker is the first neural-network tracker that combines convolutional and recurrent networks with rl algorithms."
