"crack front waves and the dynamics of a rapidly moving crack. crack front waves are localized waves that propagate along the leading edge of a crack. they are generated by the interaction of a crack with a localized material inhomogeneity. we show that front waves are nonlinear entities that transport energy, generate surface structure and lead to localized velocity fluctuations. their existence locally imparts inertia, which is not incorporated in current theories of fracture, to initially ""massless"" cracks. this, coupled to crack instabilities, yields both inhomogeneity and scaling behavior within fracture surface structure."
"nonlinearity tunes crack dynamics in soft materials. cracks in soft materials exhibit diverse dynamic patterns, involving straight, oscillation, branching, and supershear fracture. here, we successfully reproduce these crack morphologies in a two-dimensional pre-strained fracture scenario and establish crack stability phase diagrams for three distinct nonlinear materials using a fracture phase field model. the contrasting phase diagrams highlight the crucial role of nonlinearity in regulating crack dynamics. in strain-softening materials, crack branching prevails, limiting the cracks to sub-rayleigh states. yet strain-stiffening stabilizes crack propagation, allowing for the presence of supershear fracture. of particular interest is the large-strain linear elastic materials, where crack oscillation is readily triggered. the onset speed of such instability scales linearly with the characteristic wave speed near the crack tip, supporting the notion that such crack oscillations are a universal instability closely tied to the wave speed. the oscillation wavelength is shown to be a bilinear function of the nonlinear scale and crack driving force, with a minimum length scale associated with the dissipative zone. moreover, our findings suggest that the increase in characteristic wave speed due to strain-stiffening can account for the observed transition of cracks from sub-rayleigh to supershear regimes."
"on the crack-driving force of phase-field models in linearized and finite elasticity. the phase-field approach to fracture has been proven to be a mathematically sound and easy to implement method for computing crack propagation with arbitrary crack paths. hereby crack growth is driven by energy minimization resulting in a variational crack-driving force. the definition of this force out of a tension-related energy functional does, however, not always agree with the established failure criteria of fracture mechanics. in this work different variational formulations for linear and finite elastic materials are discussed and ad-hoc driving forces are presented which are motivated by general fracture mechanical considerations. the superiority of the generalized approach is demonstrated by a series of numerical examples."
