"timely monitoring of dynamic sources with observations from multiple wireless sensors. age of information (aoi) has recently received much attention due to its relevance in iot sensing and monitoring applications. in this paper, we consider the problem of minimizing the aoi in a system in which a set of sources are observed by multiple sensors in a many-to-many relationship, and the probability that a sensor observes a source depends on the state of the source. this model represents many practical scenarios, such as the ones in which multiple cameras or microphones are deployed to monitor objects moving in certain areas. we formulate the scheduling problem as a markov decision process, and show how the age-optimal scheduling policy can be obtained. we further consider partially observable variants of the problem, and devise approximate policies for large state spaces. our evaluations show that the approximate policies work well in the considered scenarios, and that the fact that sensors can observe multiple sources is beneficial, especially when there is high uncertainty of the source states."
"on the role of age of information in the internet of things. in this article, we provide an accessible introduction to the emerging idea of age of information (aoi) that quantifies freshness of information and explore its possible role in the efficient design of freshness-aware internet of things (iot). we start by summarizing the concept of aoi and its variants with emphasis on the differences between aoi and other well-known performance metrics in the literature, such as throughput and delay. building on this, we explore freshness-aware iot design for a network in which iot devices sense potentially different physical processes and are supposed to frequently update the status of these processes at a destination node (such as a cellular base station). inspired by the recent interest, we also assume that these iot devices are powered by wireless energy transfer by the destination node. for this setting, we investigate the optimal sampling policy that jointly optimizes wireless energy transfer and scheduling of update packet transmissions from iot devices with the goal of minimizing long-term weighted sum-aoi. using this, we characterize the achievable aoi region. we also compare this aoi-optimal policy with the one that maximizes average throughput (throughput-optimal policy), and demonstrate the impact of system state on their structures. several promising directions for future research are also presented."
"minimizing age of information with power constraints: multi-user opportunistic scheduling in multi-state time-varying channels. this work is motivated by the need of collecting fresh data from power-constrained sensors in the industrial internet of things (iiot) network. a recently proposed metric, the age of information (aoi) is adopted to measure data freshness from the perspective of the central controller in the iiot network. we wonder what is the minimum average aoi the network can achieve and how to design scheduling algorithms to approach it. to answer these questions when the channel states of the network are markov time-varying and scheduling decisions are restricted to bandwidth constraint, we first decouple the multi-sensor scheduling problem into a single-sensor constrained markov decision process (cmdp) through relaxation of the hard bandwidth constraint. next we exploit the threshold structure of the optimal policy for the decoupled single sensor cmdp and obtain the optimum solution through linear programming (lp). finally, an asymptotically optimal truncated policy that can satisfy the hard bandwidth constraint is built upon the optimal solution to each of the decoupled single-sensor. our investigation shows that to obtain a small aoi performance: (1) the scheduler exploits good channels to schedule sensors supported by limited power; (2) sensors equipped with enough transmission power are updated in a timely manner such that the bandwidth constraint can be satisfied."
