"on the near horizon rotating black hole geometries with nut charges. the near horizon geometries are usually constructed by implementing a specific limit to a given extreme black hole configuration. their salient feature is that the isometry group includes the conformal subgroup so(2,1). in this work, we turn the logic around and use the conformal invariants for constructing ricci-flat metrics in d=4 and d=5 where the vacuum einstein equations reduce to a coupled set of ordinary differential equations. in four dimensions the analysis can be carried out in full generality and the resulting metric describes the d=4 near horizon kerr-nut black hole. in five dimensions we choose a specific ansatz whose structure is similar to the d=5 near horizon myers-perry black hole. a ricci-flat metric involving five arbitrary parameters is constructed. a particular member of this family, which is characterized by three parameters, seems to be a natural candidate to describe the d=5 near horizon myers-perry black hole with a nut charge."
"electromagnetic field in higher-dimensional black-hole spacetimes. a special test electromagnetic field in the spacetime of the higher-dimensional generally rotating nut-(a)ds black hole is found. it is adjusted to the hidden symmetries of the background represented by the principal killing-yano tensor. such electromagnetic field generalizes the field of charged black hole in four dimensions. in higher dimensions, however, the gravitational back reaction of such a field cannot be consistently solved."
"black bounce solutions via nonminimal scalar-electrodynamic couplings. black-bounce (bb) solutions generalize the spacetimes of black holes, regular black holes, and wormholes, depending on the values of certain characteristic parameters. in this work, we investigate such solutions within the framework of general relativity (gr), assuming spherical symmetry and static geometry. it is well established in the literature that, in order to sustain such geometries, the source of einstein's equations in the bb context can be composed of a scalar field $\varphi$ and a nonlinear electrodynamics (nled). in our model, in addition to the lagrangian associated with the scalar field in the action, we also include an interaction term of the form $w(\varphi)\mathcal{l}(f)$, which introduces a nonminimal coupling between the scalar field and the electromagnetic sector. notably, the usual minimal coupling configuration is recovered by setting $w(\varphi)=1$. in contrast to approaches where the function $w(\varphi)$ is assumed a priori, here we determine its functional form by modeling the radial dependence of the derivative of the electromagnetic lagrangian as a power law, namely $\mathcal{l}_f(r) \sim f^n$. this approach enables us to determine $w(r)$ directly from the obtained solutions. we apply this procedure to two specific geometries: the simpson-visser-type bb solution and the bardeen-type bb solution, both analyzed in the purely magnetic ($q_m \neq 0$, $q_e=0$) and purely electric ($q_m=0$, $q_e \neq 0$) cases. in all scenarios, we find that these bb spacetime solutions can be described with a linear electrodynamics, which is a noteworthy result. furthermore, we examine the regularity of the spacetime through the kretschmann scalar and briefly discuss the associated energy conditions for the solutions obtained."
