"hardness of interval scheduling on unrelated machines. we provide new (parameterized) computational hardness results for interval scheduling on unrelated machines. it is a classical scheduling problem motivated from just-in-time or lean manufacturing, where the goal is to complete jobs exactly at their deadline. we are given $n$ jobs and $m$ machines. each job has a deadline, a weight, and a processing time that may be different on each machine. the goal is find a schedule that maximized the total weight of jobs completed exactly at their deadline. note that this uniquely defines a processing time interval for each job on each machine. interval scheduling on unrelated machines is closely related to coloring interval graphs and has been thoroughly studied for several decades. however, as pointed out by mnich and van bevern [computers \& operations research, 2018], the parameterized complexity for the number $m$ of machines as a parameter remained open. we resolve this by showing that interval scheduling on unrelated machines is w[1]-hard when parameterized by the number $m$ of machines. to this end, we prove w[1]-hardness with respect to $m$ of the special case where we have parallel machines with eligible machine sets for jobs. this answers open problem 8 of mnich and van bevern's list of 15 open problems in the parameterized complexity of scheduling [computers \& operations research, 2018]. furthermore, we resolve the computational complexity status of the unweighted version of interval scheduling on unrelated machines by proving that it is np-complete. this answers an open question by sung and vlach [journal of scheduling, 2005]."
"a 2-competitive largest job on least loaded machine online algorithm based on multi lists scheduling model. online scheduling in identical machines with makespan minimization has been a well studied research problem in the literature. in online scheduling, the scheduler receives a list of jobs one by one and assigns each incoming job on the fly irrevocably to one of the machines before the arrival of the next job. in this paper, we study a variant of the online scheduling problem, where jobs are requested on the fly from k distinct sources. on simultaneous arrival of jobs from multiple sources, it is a non-trivial research challenge to ensure fairness in scheduling with respect to distinct sources, while optimizing the overall makespan of the schedule. we develop a novel multi lists scheduling model(mls) and propose a 2-competitive deterministic online algorithm namely largest job on least loaded machine(ljllm) based on the mls model to address the above mentioned research challenge."
"scheduling on identical machines with setup time and unknown execution time. in this study, we investigate a scheduling problem on identical machines in which jobs require initial setup before execution. we assume that an algorithm can dynamically form a batch (i.e., a collection of jobs to be processed together) from the remaining jobs. the setup time is modeled as a known monotone function of the set of jobs within a batch, while the execution time of each job remains unknown until completion. this uncertainty poses significant challenges for minimizing the makespan. we address these challenges by considering two scenarios: each job batch must be assigned to a single machine, or a batch may be distributed across multiple machines. for both scenarios, we analyze settings with and without preemption. across these four settings, we design online algorithms that achieve asymptotically optimal competitive ratios with respect to both the number of jobs and the number of machines."
