"cyclic descents for near-hook and two-row shapes. a notion of cyclic descents on standard young tableaux (syt) of rectangular shape was introduced by rhoades, and extended to certain skew shapes by the last two authors. the cyclic descent set restricts to the usual descent set when the largest value is ignored, and has the property that the number of syt of a given shape with a given cyclic descent set $d$ is invariant under cyclic shifts of the entries of $d$. following these results, the existence of cyclic descent sets for standard young tableaux of any skew shape other than a ribbon was conjectured by the authors, and recently proved by adin, reiner and roichman. unfortunately, the proof does not provide a natural definition of the cyclic descent set for a specific tableau. in this paper we explicitly describe cyclic descent sets and resulting generating functions for syt of (possibly skew) shapes which either have exactly two rows or are near-hooks, i.e., are one cell away from a hook. our definition provides a constructive combinatorial proof of the existence of cyclic descent sets for these shapes, and coincides with that of rhoades for two-row rectangular shapes. we also show that cyclic descent sets for near-hook shaped tableaux are unique."
"cylindric young tableaux and their properties. cylindric young tableaux are combinatorial objects that first appeared in the 1990s. a natural extension of the classical notion of a young tableau, they have since been used several times, most notably by gessel and krattenthaler and by alexander postnikov. despite this, relatively little is known about cylindric young tableaux. this paper is an investigation of the properties of this object. in this paper, we extend the robinson-schensted-knuth correspondence, a well-known and very useful bijection concerning regular young tableaux, to be a correspondence between pairs of cylindric tableaux. we use this correspondence to reach further results about cylindric tableaux. we then establish an interpretation of cylindric tableaux in terms of a game involving marble-passing. next, we demonstrate a generic method to use results concerning cylindric tableaux in order to prove results about skew young tableaux. we finish with a note on knuth equivalence and its analog for cylindric tableaux."
"the structure of alternative tableaux. in this paper we study alternative tableaux introduced by viennot. these tableaux are in simple bijection with permutation tableaux, defined previously by postnikov . we exhibit a simple recursive structure for alternative tableaux. from this decomposition, we can easily deduce a number of enumerative results. we also give bijections between these tableaux and certain classes of labeled trees. finally, we exhibit a bijection with permutations, and relate it to some other bijections that already appeared in the literature."
