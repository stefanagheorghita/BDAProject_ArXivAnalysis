"inhomogeneous structures in holographic superfluids: i. dark solitons. we begin an investigation of inhomogeneous structures in holographic superfluids. as a first example, we study domain wall like defects in the 3+1 dimensional einstein-maxwell-higgs theory, which was developed as a dual model for a holographic superconductor. in [1], we reported on such ""dark solitons"" in holographic superfluids. in this work, we present an extensive numerical study of their properties, working in the probe limit. we construct dark solitons for two possible condensing operators, and find that both of them share common features with their standard superfluid counterparts. however, both are characterized by two distinct coherence length scales (one for order parameter, one for charge condensate). we study the relative charge depletion factor and find that solitons in the two different condensates have very distinct depletion characteristics. we also study quasiparticle excitations above the holographic superfluid, and find that the scale of the excitations is comparable to the soliton coherence length scales."
"holographic superconductivity in the presence of dark matter: basic issues. the holographic approach to study strongly coupled superconductors in the presence of dark matter is reviewed. we discuss the influence of dark matter on the superconducting transition temperature of both s-wave and p-wave holographic superconductors. the upper critical field, coherence length, penetration depth of holographic superconductors as well as the metal-insulator transitions have also been analysed. issues related to the validity of ads/cft correspondence for the description of superconductors studied in the laboratory and possible experiments directed towards the detection of dark matter are discussed. in doing so we shall compare our assumptions and assertions with those generally accepted in the elementary particle experiments aimed at the detection of dark matter particles."
"analytical approach to phase transitions in rotating and non-rotating 2d holographic superconductors. analytical calculations of phase transitions in ads3 maxwell-scalar system, modeling a holographic superconductor, are performed in the probe limit of btz black hole background. estimated values of the phase transition critical temperature and of the scalar boundary operator are compared with that obtained in numerical simulations. we discuss extensions of the model to topologically massive qed3 and to inclusion of external magnetic field. the latter becomes possible through the barnett-london and the lense-thirring effects, but the former does not lead to any viable modifications. the standard setup of a holographic superconductor is extended to a rotating 2d holographic superconductor, and the main characteristics of the phase transition are calculated in the probe limit and in the small angular momentum approximation. we evaluate the feedback of the superconductor rotation on the phase transition and find the set of parameters, which lower the critical temperature in compare to the non-rotating case, or make it slightly higher."
