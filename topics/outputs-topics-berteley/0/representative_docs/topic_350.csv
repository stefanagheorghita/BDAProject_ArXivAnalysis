"chiral symmetry on the edge of 2d symmetry protected topological phases. symmetry protected topological (spt) states are short-range entangled states with symmetry, which have symmetry protected gapless edge states around a gapped bulk. recently, we proposed a systematic construction of spt phases in interacting bosonic systems, however it is not very clear what is the form of the low energy excitations on the gapless edge. in this paper, we answer this question for two dimensional bosonic spt phases with z_n and u(1) symmetry. we find that while the low energy modes of the gapless edges are non-chiral, symmetry acts on them in a chiral way, i.e. acts on the right movers and the left movers differently. this special realization of symmetry protects the gaplessness of the otherwise unstable edge states by prohibiting a direct scattering between the left and right movers. moreover, understanding of the low energy effective theory leads to experimental predictions about the spt phases. in particular, we find that all the 2d u(1) spt phases have even integer quantized hall conductance."
"quantum phase transitions between bosonic symmetry protected topological phases in two dimensions: emergent $qed_3$ and anyon superfluid. inspired by chern-simons effective theory description of symmetry protected topological (spt) phases in two dimensions, we present a projective construction for many-body wavefunctions of spt phases. using this projective construction we can systematically write down trial wavefunctions of spt phases on a lattice. an explicit example of spt phase with $u(1)$ symmetry is constructed for two types of bosons with filling $\nu_{b_1}=\nu_{b_2}=\frac12$ per site on square lattice. we study continuous phase transitions between different $u(1)$-spt phases based on projective construction. the effective theory around the critical point is emergent $qed_3$ with fermion number $n_f=2$. such a continuous phase transition however needs fine tuning, and in general there are intermediate phases between different $u(1)$-spt phases. we show that such an intermediate phase has the same response as an anyon superconductor, and hence dub it ""anyon superfluid"". a schematic phase diagram of interacting bosons with $u(1)$ symmetry is depicted."
"lattice models that realize $\mathbb{z}_n$-1-symmetry protected topological states for even $n$. higher symmetries can emerge at low energies in a topologically ordered state with no symmetry, when some topological excitations have very high energy scales while other topological excitations have low energies. the low energy properties of topological orders in this limit, with the emergent higher symmetries, may be described by higher symmetry protected topological order. this motivates us, as a simplest example, to study a lattice model of $\mathbb{z}_n$-1-symmetry protected topological (1-spt) states in 3+1d for even $n$. we write down an exactly solvable lattice model and study its boundary transformation. on the boundary, we show the existence of anyons with non-trivial self-statistics. for the $n=2$ case, where the bulk classification is given by an integer $m$ mod $4$, we show that the boundary can be gapped with double semion topological order for $m=1$ and toric code for $m=2$. the bulk ground state wavefunction amplitude is given in terms of the linking numbers of loops in the dual lattice. our construction can be generalized to arbitrary 1-spt protected by finite unitary symmetry."
