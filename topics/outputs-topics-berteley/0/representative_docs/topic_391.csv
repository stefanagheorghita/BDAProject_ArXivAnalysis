"conformal transformations of the pseudo-riemannian metric of a homogeneous pair. we introduce a new notion of a homogeneous pair for a pseudo-riemannian metric $g$ and a positive function $f$ on a manifold $m$ admitting a free $\mathbb{r}_{>0}$-action. there are many examples admitting this structure. for example, (a) a class of pseudo-hessian manifolds admitting a free $\mathbb{r}_{>0}$-action and a homogeneous potential function such as the moduli space of torsion-free $g_2$-structures, (b) the space of riemannian metrics on a compact manifold, and (c) many moduli spaces of geometric structures such as torsion-free ${\rm spin}(7)$-structures admit this structure. hence we provide the unified method for the study of these geometric structures. we consider conformal transformations of the pseudo-riemannian metric $g$ of a homogeneous pair $(g, f)$. showing that the pseudo-riemannian manifold $(m, (v \circ f) g)$, where $v: \mathbb{r}_{>0} \rightarrow \mathbb{r}_{>0}$ is a smooth function, has the structure of a warped product, we study the geometric structures such as the sectional curvature, geodesics and the metric completion (if $g$ is positive definite) w.r.t. $(v \circ f) g$ in terms of those on the level set of $f$. in particular, (1) we can generalize the result of clarke and rubinstein about the metric completion of the space of riemannian metrics w.r.t. the conformal transformations of the ebin metric, and (2) two canonical riemannian metrics on the $g_2$ moduli space have different metric completions."
riemannian products which are conformally equivalent to einstein metrics. necessary and sufficient conditions for a riemannian product to be conformally equivalent to an einstein manifold are given. such spaces which are complete are characterized.
"conformal holonomy of c-spaces, ricci-flat, and lorentzian manifolds. the main result of this paper is that a lorentzian manifold is locally conformally equivalent to a manifold with recurrent lightlike vector field and totally isotropic ricci tensor if and only if its conformal tractor holonomy admits a 2-dimensional totally isotropic invariant subspace. furthermore, for semi-riemannian manifolds of arbitrary signature we prove that the conformal holonomy algebra of a $c$-space is a berger algebra. for ricci-flat spaces we show how the conformal holonomy can be obtained by the holonomy of the ambient metric and get results for riemannian manifolds and plane waves."
