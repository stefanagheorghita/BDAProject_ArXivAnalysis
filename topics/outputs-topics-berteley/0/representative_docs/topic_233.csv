"random caching based cooperative transmission in heterogeneous wireless networks. base station cooperation in heterogeneous wireless networks (hetnets) is a promising approach to improve the network performance, but it also imposes a significant challenge on backhaul. on the other hand, caching at small base stations (sbss) is considered as an efficient way to reduce backhaul load in hetnets. in this paper, we jointly consider sbs caching and cooperation in a downlink largescale hetnet. we propose two sbs cooperative transmission schemes under random caching at sbss with the caching distribution as a design parameter. using tools from stochastic geometry and adopting appropriate integral transformations, we first derive a tractable expression for the successful transmission probability under each scheme. then, under each scheme, we consider the successful transmission probability maximization by optimizing the caching distribution, which is a challenging optimization problem with a non-convex objective function. by exploring optimality properties and using optimization techniques, under each scheme, we obtain a local optimal solution in the general case and global optimal solutions in some special cases. compared with some existing caching designs in the literature, e.g., the most popular caching, the i.i.d. caching and the uniform caching, the optimal random caching under each scheme achieves better successful transmission probability performance. the analysis and optimization results provide valuable design insights for practical hetnets."
"joint frequency reuse and cache optimization in backhaul-limited small-cell wireless networks. caching at base stations (bss) is a promising approach for supporting the tremendous traffic growth of content delivery over future small-cell wireless networks with limited backhaul. this paper considers exploiting spatial caching diversity (i.e., caching different subsets of popular content files at neighboring bss) that can greatly improve the cache hit probability, thereby leading to a better overall system performance. a key issue in exploiting spatial caching diversity is that the cached content may not be located at the nearest bs, which means that to access such content, a user needs to overcome strong interference from the nearby bss; this significantly limits the gain of spatial caching diversity. in this paper, we consider a joint design of frequency reuse and caching, such that the benefit of an improved cache hit probability induced by spatial caching diversity and the benefit of interference coordination induced by frequency reuse can be achieved simultaneously. we obtain a closed-form characterization of the approximate successful transmission probability for the proposed scheme and analyze the impact of key operating parameters on the performance. we design a low-complexity algorithm to optimize the frequency reuse factor and the cache storage allocation. simulations show that the proposed scheme achieves a higher successful transmission probability than existing caching schemes."
"decentralized coded caching without file splitting. coded caching is an effective technique to reduce the redundant traffic in wireless networks. the existing coded caching schemes require the splitting of files into a possibly large number of subfiles, i.e., they perform coded subfile caching. keeping the files intact during the caching process would actually be appealing, broadly speaking because of its simpler implementation. however, little is known about the effectiveness of this coded file caching in reducing the data delivery rate. in this paper, we propose such a file caching scheme which uses a decentralized algorithm for content placement and either an online clique cover or matching algorithm for the delivery of missing data. we derive approximations for the expected delivery rate of both schemes using the differential equations method, and show them to be tight through concentration analysis and computer simulations. our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed coded file caching is significantly more effective than uncoded caching in reducing the delivery rate. we furthermore show the additional improvement in the performance of the proposed scheme when its application is extended to subfile caching with a small number of subfiles."
