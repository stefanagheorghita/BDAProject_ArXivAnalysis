"controllability of bandlimited graph processes over random time varying graphs. controllability of complex networks arises in many technological problems involving social, financial, road, communication, and smart grid networks. in many practical situations, the underlying topology might change randomly with time, due to link failures such as changing friendships, road blocks or sensor malfunctions. thus, it leads to poorly controlled dynamics if randomness is not properly accounted for. we consider the problem of controlling the network state when the topology varies randomly with time. our problem concerns target states that are bandlimited over the graph; these are states that have nonzero frequency content only on a specific graph frequency band. we thus leverage graph signal processing and exploit the bandlimited model to drive the network state from a fixed set of control nodes. when controlling the state from a few nodes, we observe that spurious, out-of-band frequency content is created. therefore, we focus on controlling the network state over the desired frequency band, and then use a graph filter to get rid of the unwanted frequency content. to account for the topological randomness, we develop the concept of controllability in the mean, which consists of driving the expected network state towards the target state. a detailed mean squared error analysis is performed to quantify the statistical deviation between the final controlled state on a particular graph realization and the actual target state. finally, we propose different control strategies and evaluate their effectiveness on synthetic network models and social networks."
"controllability backbone in networks. this paper studies the controllability backbone problem in dynamical networks defined over graphs. the main idea of the controllability backbone is to identify a small subset of edges in a given network such that any subnetwork containing those edges/links has at least the same network controllability as the original network while assuming the same set of input/leader vertices. we consider the strong structural controllability (ssc) in our work, which is useful but computationally challenging. thus, we utilize two lower bounds on the network's ssc based on the zero forcing notion and graph distances. we provide algorithms to compute controllability backbones while preserving these lower bounds. we thoroughly analyze the proposed algorithms and compute the number of edges in the controllability backbones. finally, we compare and numerically evaluate our methods on random graphs."
"network controllability is determined by the density of low in-degree and out-degree nodes. the problem of controllability of the dynamical state of a network is central in network theory and has wide applications ranging from network medicine to financial markets. the driver nodes of the network are the nodes that can bring the network to the desired dynamical state if an external signal is applied to them. using the framework of structural controllability, here we show that the density of nodes with in-degree and out-degree equal to $0$, $1$ and $2$ determines the number of driver nodes of random networks. moreover we show that networks with minimum in-degree and out-degree greater than 2, are always fully controllable by an infinitesimal fraction of driver nodes, regardless on the other properties of the degree distribution. finally, based on these results, we propose an algorithm to improve the controllability of networks."
