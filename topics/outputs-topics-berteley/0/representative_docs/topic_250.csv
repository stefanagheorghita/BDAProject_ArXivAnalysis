"data models for radio astronomy in the vo. data models are an essential part of automatic data processing, but even more so when trying to tie together data coming from many different data sources, as is the case for the international virtual observatory. in this talk we will review the different data models used in the ivoa, which parts of that data modelling work are still incomplete, specially in radio wavelengths, and the work the amiga group has done within the ivoa data modelling working group to overcome those shortcomings both in missing data models and support for radio astronomy."
"building a vo-compliant radio astronomical data model for single-dish radio telescopes (radams). the virtual observatory (vo) is becoming the de-facto standard for astronomical data publication. however, the number of radio astronomical archives is still low in general, and even lower is the number of radio astronomical data available through the vo. in order to facilitate the building of new radio astronomical archives, easing at the same time their interoperability with vo framework, we have developed a vo-compliant data model which provides interoperable data semantics for radio data. that model, which we call the radio astronomical data model for single-dish (radams) has been built using standards of (and recommendations from) the international virtual observatory alliance (ivoa). this article describes the radams and its components, including archived entities and their relationships to vo metadata. we show that by using ivoa principles and concepts, the effort needed for both the development of the archives and their vo compatibility has been lowered, and the joint development of two radio astronomical archives have been possible. we plan to adapt radams to be able to deal with interferometry data in the future."
"the vo: a powerful tool for global astronomy. since its inception in the early 2000, the virtual observatory (vo), developed as a collaboration of many national and international projects, has become a major factor in the discovery and dissemination of astronomical information worldwide. the ivoa has been coordinating all these efforts worldwide to ensure a common vo framework that enables transparent access to and interoperability of astronomy resources (data and software) around the world. the vo is not a magic solution to all astronomy data management challenges but it does bring useful solutions in many areas borne out by the fact that vo interfaces are broadly found in astronomy major data centres and projects worldwide. astronomy data centres have been building vo services on top of their existing data services to increase interoperability with other vo-compliant data resources to take advantage of the continuous and increasing development of vo applications. vo applications have made multi-instrument and multi-wavelength science, a difficult and fruitful part of astronomy, somewhat easier. more recently, several major new astronomy projects have been directly adopting vo standards to build their data management infrastructure, giving birth to vo built-in archives. embracing the vo framework from the beginning brings the double gain of not needing to reinvent the wheel and ensuring from the start interoperability with other astronomy vo resources. some of the ivoa standards are also starting to be used by neighbour disciplines like planetary sciences. there is still quite a lot to be done on the vo, in particular tackling the upcoming big data challenge and how to find interoperable solutions to the new data analysis paradigm of bringing and running the software close to the data."
