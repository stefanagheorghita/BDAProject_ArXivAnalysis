"collision-free trajectory planning for autonomous surface vehicle. in this paper, we propose an efficient and accurate method for autonomous surface vehicles to generate a smooth and collision-free trajectory considering its dynamics constraints. we decouple the trajectory planning problem as a front-end feasible path searching and a back-end kinodynamic trajectory optimization. firstly, we model the type of two-thrusts under-actuated surface vessel. then we adopt a sampling-based path searching to find an asymptotic optimal path through the obstacle-surrounding environment and extract several waypoints from it. we apply a numerical optimization method in the back-end to generate the trajectory. from the perspective of security in the field voyage, we propose the sailing corridor method to guarantee the trajectory away from obstacles. moreover, considering limited fuel asv carrying, we design a numerical objective function which can optimize a fuel-saving trajectory. finally, we validate and compare the proposed method in simulation environments and the results fit our expected trajectory."
"improved path planning by tightly combining lattice-based path planning and numerical optimal control. this paper presents a unified optimization-based path planning approach to efficiently compute locally optimal solutions to advanced path planning problems. the approach is motivated by first showing that a lattice-based path planner can be cast and analyzed as a bilevel optimization problem. this information is then used to tightly integrate a lattice-based path planner and numerical optimal control in a novel way. the lattice-based path planner is applied to the problem in a first step using a discretized search space, where system dynamics and objective function are chosen to coincide with those used in a second numerical optimal control step. as a consequence, the lattice planner provides the numerical optimal control step with a resolution optimal solution to the problem, which is highly suitable as a warm-start to the second step. this novel tight combination of a sampling-based path planner and numerical optimal control makes, in a structured way, benefit of the former method's ability to solve combinatorial parts of the problem and the latter method's ability to obtain locally optimal solutions not constrained to a discretized search space. compared to previously presented combinations of sampling-based path planners and optimization, the proposed approach is shown in several path planning experiments to provide significant improvements in terms of computation time, numerical reliability, and objective function value."
"sandwich approach for motion planning and control. this paper develops a new approach for robot motion planning and control in obstacle-laden environments that is inspired by fundamentals of fluid mechanics. for motion planning, we propose a novel transformation between motion space, with arbitrary obstacles of random sizes and shapes, and an obstacle-free planning space with geodesically-varying distances and constrained transitions. we then obtain robot desired trajectory by a* searching over a uniform grid distributed over the planning space. we show that implementing the a* search over the planning space can generate shorter paths when compared to the existing a* searching over the motion space. for trajectory tracking, we propose an mpc-based trajectory tracking control, with linear equality and inequality safety constraints, enforcing the safety requirements of planning and control."
