"two dimensional kagome correlations and field induced order in the ferromagnetic xy pyrochlore yb2ti2o7. neutron scattering measurements show the ferromagnetic xy pyrochlore yb2ti2o7 to display strong quasi-two dimensional (2d) spin correlations at low temperature, which give way to long range order (lro) under the application of modest magnetic fields. rods of scattering along < 111 > directions due to these 2d spin correlations imply a magnetic decomposition of the cubic pyrochlore system into decoupled kagome planes. a magnetic field of ~0.5 t applied along the [1-10] direction induces a transition to a 3d lro state characterized by long-lived, dispersive spin waves. our measurements map out a complex low temperature-field phase diagram for this exotic pyrochlore magnet."
"competing magnetic phases in the frustrated spin-1/2 chain compound $\beta$-tevo$_4$ probed by nmr. in frustrated spin-1/2 chains the competition between the nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor exchange interactions leads to a rich phase diagram that becomes even richer in the presence of perturbations in their material realizations. these effects are still largely unexplored, so that new insight into static and dynamic magnetism, in particular by sensitive local probes, is highly desired. here we present a comprehensive $^{17}$o nuclear magnetic resonance study of $\beta$-tevo$_4$, where the anisotropy of the main exchange interactions and additional weak interchain exchange interactions complement the theoretical phase diagram. our results confirm the dynamical nature of the intriguing spin-stripe phase that has been reported in previous studies. in addition, we find that the magnetic order in the high-field phase, which develops just below the magnetization saturation, is consistent with an unusual type of spin-density-wave (sdw) order with different alignments of the magnetic moments on the neighboring chains. this is reminiscent of the ordering in the sdw phase, realized in the absence of the magnetic field, and is thus most likely stabilized by magnetic anisotropy."
"low temperature specific heat and possible gap to magnetic excitations in the heisenberg pyrochlore antiferromagnet gd2sn207. the gd2sn2o7 pyrochlore heisenberg antiferromagnet displays a phase transition to a four sublattice neel ordered state at a temperature near 1 k. despite the seemingly conventional nature of the ordered state, the specific heat has been found to be described in the temperature range 350-800 mk by an anomalous t-squared power law. a similar temperature dependence has also been reported for gd2ti2o7, another pyrochlore heisenberg material. such anomalous t-squared behavior in cv has been argued to be correlated to an unusual energy-dependence of the density of states which also seemingly manifests itself in low-temperature spin fluctuations found in muon spin relaxation experiments. in this paper, we report calculations of cv that consider spin wave like excitations out of the neel order observed in gd2sn2o7 and argue that the parametric t-squared behavior does not reflect the true low-energy excitations of gd2sn2o7. rather, we find that the low-energy excitations of this material are antiferromagnetic magnons gapped by single-ion and dipolar anisotropy effects, and that the lowest temperature of 350 mk considered in previous specific heat measurements accidentally happens to coincide with a crossover temperature below which magnons become thermally activated and cv takes an exponential form. we argue that further specific heat measurements that extend down to at least 100 mk are required in order to ascribe an unconventional description of magnetic excitations out of the ground state of gd2sn2o7 or to invalidate the standard picture of gapped excitations proposed herein."
