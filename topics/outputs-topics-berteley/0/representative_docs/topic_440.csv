"applicability of well-established memristive models for simulations of resistive switching devices. highly accurate and predictive models of resistive switching devices are needed to enable future memory and logic design. widely used is the memristive modeling approach considering resistive switches as dynamical systems. here we introduce three evaluation criteria for memristor models, checking for plausibility of the i-v characteristics, the presence of a sufficiently non-linearity of the switching kinetics, and the feasibility of predicting the behavior of two anti-serially connected devices correctly. we analyzed two classes of models: the first class comprises common linear memristor models and the second class widely used non-linear memristive models. the linear memristor models are based on strukovs initial memristor model extended by different window functions, while the non-linear models include picketts physics-based memristor model and models derived thereof. this study reveals lacking predictivity of the first class of models, independent of the applied window function. only the physics-based model is able to fulfill most of the basic evaluation criteria."
"delay conditioned generative modelling of resistive drift in memristors. the modelling of memristive devices is an essential part of the development of novel in-memory computing systems. models are needed to enable the accurate and efficient simulation of memristor device characteristics, for purposes of testing the performance of the devices or the feasibility of their use in future neuromorphic and in-memory computing architectures. the consideration of memristor non-idealities is an essential part of any modelling approach. the nature of the deviation of memristive devices from their initial state, particularly at ambient temperature and in the absence of a stimulating voltage, is of key interest, as it dictates their reliability as information storage media - a property that is of importance for both traditional storage and neuromorphic applications. in this paper, we investigate the use of a generative modelling approach for the simulation of the delay and initial resistance-conditioned resistive drift distribution of memristive devices. we introduce a data normalisation scheme and a novel training technique to enable the generative model to be conditioned on the continuous inputs. the proposed generative modelling approach is suited for use in end-to-end training and device modelling scenarios, including learned data storage applications, due to its simulation efficiency and differentiability."
"efficient and fault-tolerant memristive neural networks with in-situ training. neuromorphic architectures, which incorporate parallel and in-memory processing, are crucial for accelerating artificial neural network (ann) computations. this work presents a novel memristor-based multi-layer neural network (memristive mlnn) architecture and an efficient in-situ training algorithm. the proposed design performs matrix-vector multiplications, outer products, and weight updates in constant time $\mathcal{o}(1)$, leveraging the inherent parallelism of memristive crossbars. each synapse is realized using a single memristor, eliminating the need for transistors, and offering enhanced area and energy efficiency. the architecture is evaluated through ltspice simulations on the iris, nasa asteroid, and breast cancer wisconsin datasets, achieving classification accuracies of 98.22\%, 90.43\%, and 98.59\%, respectively. robustness is assessed by introducing stuck-at-conducting-state faults in randomly selected memristors. the effects of nonlinearity in memristor conductance and a 10\% device variation are also analyzed. the simulation results establish that the network's performance is not affected significantly by faulty memristors, non-linearity, and device variation."
