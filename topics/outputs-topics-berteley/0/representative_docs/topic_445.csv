"design and control of a micro overactuated aerial robot with an origami delta manipulator. this work presents the mechanical design and control of a novel small-size and lightweight micro aerial vehicle (mav) for aerial manipulation. to our knowledge, with a total take-off mass of only 2.0 kg, the proposed system is the most lightweight aerial manipulator (am) that has 8-dof independently controllable: 5 for the aerial platform and 3 for the articulated arm. we designed the robot to be fully-actuated in the body forward direction. this allows independent pitching and instantaneous force generation, improving the platform's performance during physical interaction. the robotic arm is an origami delta manipulator driven by three servomotors, enabling active motion compensation at the end-effector. its composite multimaterial links help reduce the weight, while their flexibility allow for compliant aerial interaction with the environment. in particular, the arm's stiffness can be changed according to its configuration. we provide an in depth discussion of the system design and characterize the stiffness of the delta arm. a control architecture to deal with the platform's overactuation while exploiting the delta arm is presented. its capabilities are experimentally illustrated both in free flight and physical interaction, highlighting advantages and disadvantages of the origami's folding mechanism."
"physical interaction and manipulation of the environment using aerial robots. the physical interaction of aerial robots with their environment has countless potential applications and is an emerging area with many open challenges. fully-actuated multirotors have been introduced to tackle some of these challenges. they provide complete control over position and orientation and eliminate the need for attaching a multi-dof manipulation arm to the robot. however, there are many open problems before they can be used in real-world applications. researchers have introduced some methods for physical interaction in limited settings. their experiments primarily use prototype-level software without an efficient path to integration with real-world applications. we describe a new cost-effective solution for integrating these robots with the existing software and hardware flight systems for real-world applications and expand it to physical interaction applications. on the other hand, the existing control approaches for fully-actuated robots assume conservative limits for the thrusts and moments available to the robot. using conservative assumptions for these already-inefficient robots makes their interactions even less optimal and may even result in many feasible physical interaction applications becoming infeasible. this work proposes a real-time method for estimating the complete set of instantaneously available forces and moments that robots can use to optimize their physical interaction performance. finally, many real-world applications where aerial robots can improve the existing manual solutions deal with deformable objects. however, the perception and planning for their manipulation is still challenging. this research explores how aerial physical interaction can be extended to deformable objects. it provides a detection method suitable for manipulating deformable one-dimensional objects and introduces a new perspective on planning the manipulation of these objects."
"design and control of an aerial manipulator for contact-based inspection. manipulator dynamics, external forces and moments raise issues in stability and efficient control during aerial manipulation. additionally, multirotor micro aerial vehicles impose stringent limits on payload, actuation and system states. in view of these challenges, this work addressed the design and control of a 3-dof serial aerial manipulator for contact inspection. a lightweight design with sufficient dexterous workspace for ndt (non-destructive testing) inspection is presented. this operation requires the regulation of normal force on the inspected point. contact dynamics have been discussed along with a simulation of the closed-loop dynamics during contact. the simulated controller preserves inherent system nonlinearities and uses a passivity approach to ensure the convergence of error to zero. a transition scheme from free-flight to contact was developed along with the hardware and software frameworks for implementation. this paper concludes with important drawbacks and prospects."
