"spherical and deformed shell effect competition in quasifission of superheavy nuclei. quasifission, along with fusion-fission, represent the two most likely reaction outcomes to occur post-capture in collisions leading to superheavy nuclei. as such, understanding these mechanisms and how they relate to one another is key to understanding the intricate dynamics that drive the formation (or dissociation) of the nascent compound nuclei formed in fusion reactions. this understanding directly translates to a more informed picture of suitable reaction partners and can provide vital information for experimental efforts to study the physics and chemistry of superheavy elements. in this work we report results from time-dependent simulations of $^{48}$ca + $^{238}$u and $^{50}$ti + $^{236}$th reactions at incident energies just above the coulomb barrier with a focus on the quasifission process that prevent the formation of a fully equilibrated $^{286}$cn compound nucleus. we study these reactions systematically and consider a wide range of initial configurations to extract a robust estimate of primary fragment yields for the quasifission process. multiple preferred exit channels are observed, with both spherical and deformed shell effects in the heavy and light fragments driving contributions to the production yields depending on the initial configuration of the system. orientation effects of the deformed actinide targets are found to be a primary driver of which exit channels are populated. furthermore, the impact of moving away from a doubly-magic projectile is explored with implications towards the reactions considered for current and future superheavy searches."
"barrier distributions as a tool to investigate fusion and fission. the recent availability of precisely measured fusion cross-sections has enabled the extraction of a representation of the distribution of barriers encountered during fusion. these representations, obtained from a variety of reactions, provide a direct observation of how the structure of the fusing nuclei changes the inter-nuclear potential landscape, thus affecting the fusion probability. recent experiments showing the effects of static quadrupole and hexadecapole deformation, single-- and double-phonon states, transfer of nucleons between two nuclei, and high lying excited states are reviewed. the application of these concepts to the explanation of the anomalous fission-fragment anisotropies observed following reactions with actinides is discussed."
"future of superheavy element research: which nuclei could be synthesized within the next few years?. low values of the fusion cross sections and very short half-lives of nuclei with z$>$120 put obstacles in synthesis of new elements. different nuclear reactions (fusion of stable and radioactive nuclei, multi-nucleon transfers and neutron capture), which could be used for the production of new isotopes of superheavy (sh) elements, are discussed in the paper. the gap of unknown sh nuclei, located between the isotopes which were produced earlier in the cold and hot fusion reactions, can be filled in fusion reactions of $^{48}$ca with available lighter isotopes of pu, am, and cm. cross sections for the production of these nuclei are predicted to be rather large, and the corresponding experiments can be easily performed at existing facilities. for the first time, a narrow pathway is found to the middle of the island of stability owing to possible $\beta^+$-decay of sh isotopes which can be formed in ordinary fusion reactions of stable nuclei. multi-nucleon transfer processes at near barrier collisions of heavy (and very heavy, u-like) ions are shown to be quite realistic reaction mechanism allowing us to produce new neutron enriched heavy nuclei located in the unexplored upper part of the nuclear map. neutron capture reactions can be also used for the production of the long-living neutron rich sh nuclei. strong neutron fluxes might be provided by pulsed nuclear reactors and by nuclear explosions in laboratory conditions and by supernova explosions in nature. all these possibilities are discussed in the paper."
