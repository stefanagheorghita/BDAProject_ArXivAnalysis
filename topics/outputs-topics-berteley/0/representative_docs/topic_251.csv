"thermodynamic control and dynamical regimes in protein folding. monte carlo simulations of a simple lattice model of protein folding show two distinct regimes depending on the chain length. the first regime well describes the folding of small protein sequences and its kinetic counterpart appears to be single exponential in nature, while the second regime is typical of sequences longer than 80 amino acids and the folding performance achievable is sensitive to target conformation. the extent to which stability, as measured by the energy of a sequence in the target, is an essential requirement and affects the folding dynamics of protein molecules in the first regime is investigated. the folding dynamics of sequences whose design stage was restricted to a certain fraction of randomly selected amino acids shows that while some degree of stability is a necessary and sufficient condition for successful folding, designing sequences that provide the lowest energy in the target seems to be a superfluous constraint. by studying the dynamics of under annealed but otherwise freely designed sequences we explore the relation between stability and kinetic accessibility. we find that there is no one-to-one correspondence between having low energy and folding quickly to the target, as only a small fraction of the most stable sequences were also found to fold relatively quickly."
"protein photo-folding and quantum folding theory. the rates of protein folding with photon absorption or emission and the cross section of photon -protein inelastic scattering are calculated from the quantum folding theory by use of standard field-theoretical method. all these protein photo-folding processes are compared with common protein folding without interaction of photons (nonradiative folding). it is demonstrated that there exists a common factor (thermo-averaged overlap integral of vibration wave function, taoi) for protein folding and protein photo-folding. based on this finding it is predicted that: 1) the stimulated photo-folding rates show the same temperature dependence as protein folding; 2) the spectral line of electronic transition is broadened to a band which includes abundant vibration spectrum without and with conformational transition and the width of the vibration spectral line is largely reduced; 3) the resonance fluorescence cross section changes with temperature obeying the same law (luo-lu's law). the particular form of the folding rate - temperature relation and the abundant spectral structure imply the existence of a set of quantum oscillators in the transition process and these oscillators are mainly of torsion type of low frequency, imply the quantum tunneling between protein conformations does exist in folding and photo-folding processes and the tunneling is rooted deeply in the coherent motion of the conformational-electronic system."
"relationship between structural fractal and possible dynamic scaling properties in protein folding. in this letter, the possible dynamic scaling properties of protein molecules in folding are investigated theoretically by assuming that the protein molecules are percolated networks. it is shown that the fractal character and the fractal dimensionality may exist only for short sequences in large protein molecules and small protein molecules with homogeneous structure, the fractal dimensionality are obtained for different structures. we then show that there might exist the dynamic scaling properties in protein folding, the critical exponents in the folding for some small global proteins with homogeneous structure are obtained. the dynamic critical exponents of the global proteins in folding are relevant to the fractal dimensionality of its structure, which implies the close relationship between the dynamic process in protein folding and its structure kinematics."
