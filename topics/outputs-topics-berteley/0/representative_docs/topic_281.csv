"incorporating coincidental water data into non-intrusive load monitoring. non-intrusive load monitoring (nilm) as the process of extracting the usage pattern of appliances from the aggregated power signal is among successful approaches aiding residential energy management. in recent years, high volume datasets on power profiles have become available, which has helped make classification methods employed for the nilm purpose more effective and more accurate. however, the presence of multi-mode appliances and appliances with close power values have remained influential in worsening the computational complexity and diminishing the accuracy of these algorithms. to tackle these challenges, we propose an event-based classification process, in the first phase of which the $k$-nearest neighbors method, as a fast classification technique, is employed to extract power signals of appliances with exclusive non-overlapping power values. then, two deep learning models, which consider the water consumption of some appliances as a novel signature in the network, are utilized to distinguish between appliances with overlapping power values. in addition to power disaggregation, the proposed process as well extracts the water consumption profiles of specific appliances. to illustrate the proposed process and validate its efficiency, seven appliances of the ampds are considered, with the numerical classification results showing marked improvement with respect to the existing classification-based nilm techniques."
"a hybrid event detection approach for non-intrusive load monitoring. non-intrusive load monitoring (nilm) is a practical method to provide appliance-level electricity consumption information. event detection, as an important part of event-based nilm methods, has a direct impact on the accuracy of the ultimate load disaggregation results in the entire nilm framework. this paper presents a hybrid event detection approach for relatively complex household load datasets that include appliances with long transients, high fluctuations, and/or near-simultaneous actions. the proposed approach includes a base algorithm based on moving average change with time limit, and two auxiliary algorithms based on derivative analysis and filtering analysis. the structure, steps, and working principle of this approach are described in detail. the proposed approach does not require additional information about household appliances, nor does it require any training sets. case studies on different datasets are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach in comparison with several existing approaches including log likelihood ratio detector with maxima (lld-max) approach, active window-based (awb) approach, and generalized likelihood ratio (glr) approach. results show that the proposed approach works well in detecting events in complex household load datasets and performs better than the existing approaches."
"non-intrusive load monitoring (nilm) using deep neural networks: a review. demand-side management now encompasses more residential loads. to efficiently apply demand response strategies, it's essential to periodically observe the contribution of various domestic appliances to total energy consumption. non-intrusive load monitoring (nilm), also known as load disaggregation, is a method for decomposing the total energy consumption profile into individual appliance load profiles within the household. it has multiple applications in demand-side management, energy consumption monitoring, and analysis. various methods, including machine learning and deep learning, have been used to implement and improve nilm algorithms. this paper reviews some recent nilm methods based on deep learning and introduces the most accurate methods for residential loads. it summarizes public databases for nilm evaluation and compares methods using standard performance metrics."
