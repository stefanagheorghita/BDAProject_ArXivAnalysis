"mining compressed repetitive gapped sequential patterns efficiently. mining frequent sequential patterns from sequence databases has been a central research topic in data mining and various efficient mining sequential patterns algorithms have been proposed and studied. recently, in many problem domains (e.g, program execution traces), a novel sequential pattern mining research, called mining repetitive gapped sequential patterns, has attracted the attention of many researchers, considering not only the repetition of sequential pattern in different sequences but also the repetition within a sequence is more meaningful than the general sequential pattern mining which only captures occurrences in different sequences. however, the number of repetitive gapped sequential patterns generated by even these closed mining algorithms may be too large to understand for users, especially when support threshold is low. in this paper, we propose and study the problem of compressing repetitive gapped sequential patterns. inspired by the ideas of summarizing frequent itemsets, rpglobal, we develop an algorithm, crgsgrow (compressing repetitive gapped sequential pattern grow), including an efficient pruning strategy, syncscan, and an efficient representative pattern checking scheme, -dominate sequential pattern checking. the crgsgrow is a two-step approach: in the first step, we obtain all closed repetitive sequential patterns as the candidate set of representative repetitive sequential patterns, and at the same time get the most of representative repetitive sequential patterns; in the second step, we only spend a little time in finding the remaining the representative patterns from the candidate set. an empirical study with both real and synthetic data sets clearly shows that the crgsgrow has good performance."
"enhancing customer contact efficiency with graph neural networks in credit card fraud detection workflow. credit card fraud has been a persistent issue since the last century, causing significant financial losses to the industry. the most effective way to prevent fraud is by contacting customers to verify suspicious transactions. however, while these systems are designed to detect fraudulent activity, they often mistakenly flag legitimate transactions, leading to unnecessary declines that disrupt the user experience and erode customer trust. frequent false positives can frustrate customers, resulting in dissatisfaction, increased complaints, and a diminished sense of security. to address these limitations, we propose a fraud detection framework incorporating relational graph convolutional networks (rgcn) to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of identifying fraudulent transactions. by leveraging the relational structure of transaction data, our model reduces the need for direct customer confirmation while maintaining high detection performance. our experiments are conducted using the ibm credit card transaction dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach."
"fri-miner: fuzzy rare itemset mining. data mining is a widely used technology for various real-life applications of data analytics and is important to discover valuable association rules in transaction databases. interesting itemset mining plays an important role in many real-life applications, such as market, e-commerce, finance, and medical treatment. to date, various data mining algorithms based on frequent patterns have been widely studied, but there are a few algorithms that focus on mining infrequent or rare patterns. in some cases, infrequent or rare itemsets and rare association rules also play an important role in real-life applications. in this paper, we introduce a novel fuzzy-based rare itemset mining algorithm called fri-miner, which discovers valuable and interesting fuzzy rare itemsets in a quantitative database by applying fuzzy theory with linguistic meaning. additionally, fri-miner utilizes the fuzzy-list structure to store important information and applies several pruning strategies to reduce the search space. the experimental results show that the proposed fri-miner algorithm can discover fewer and more interesting itemsets by considering the quantitative value in reality. moreover, it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of effectiveness (w.r.t. different types of derived patterns) and efficiency (w.r.t. running time and memory usage)."
