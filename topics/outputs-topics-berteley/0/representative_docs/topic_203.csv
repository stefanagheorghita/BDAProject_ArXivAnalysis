"room-temperature exceptional-point-driven polariton lasing from perovskite metasurface. excitons in lead bromide perovskites exhibit high binding energy and high oscillator strength, allowing for a strong light-matter coupling regime in the perovskite-based cavities localizing photons at the nanoscale. this opens up the way for the realization of exciton-polariton bose-einstein condensation and polariton lasing at room temperature -- the inversion-free low-threshold stimulated emission. however, polariton lasing in perovskite planar photon cavities without bragg mirrors has not yet been observed and proved experimentally. in this work, we employ perovskite metasurface, fabricated with nanoimprint lithography, supporting so-called exceptional points to demonstrate the room-temperature polariton lasing. the exceptional points in exciton-polariton dispersion of the metasurface appear upon optically pumping in the nonlinear regime in the spectral vicinity of a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum providing high mode confinement with the enhanced local density of states beneficial for polariton condensation. the observed lasing emission possesses high directivity with a divergence angle of around 1$^\circ$ over one axis. the employed nanoimprinting approach for solution-processable large-scale polariton lasers is compatible with various planar photonic platforms suitable for on-chip integration."
"thermalization rate of polaritons in strongly-coupled molecular systems. polariton thermalization is a key process in achieving light-matter bose--einstein condensation, spanning from solid-state semiconductor microcavities at cryogenic temperatures to surface plasmon nanocavities with molecules at room temperature. originated from the matter component of polariton states, the microscopic mechanisms of thermalization are closely tied to specific material properties. in this work, we investigate polariton thermalization in strongly-coupled molecular systems. we develop a microscopic theory addressing polariton thermalization through electron-phonon interactions (known as exciton-vibration coupling) with low-energy molecular vibrations. this theory presents a simple analytical method to calculate the temperature-dependent polariton thermalization rate, utilizing experimentally accessible spectral properties of bare molecules, such as the stokes shift and temperature-dependent linewidth of photoluminescence, in conjunction with well-known parameters of optical cavities. our findings demonstrate qualitative agreement with recent experimental reports of nonequilibrium polariton condensation in both ground and excited states, and explain the thermalization bottleneck effect observed at low temperatures. this study showcases the significance of vibrational degrees of freedom in polariton condensation and offers practical guidance for future experiments, including the selection of suitable material systems and cavity designs."
"reanalysis of experimental determinations of polariton-polariton interactions in microcavities. the polariton-polariton interaction strength is an important parameter for all kinds of applications using the nonlinear properties of polaritons, such as optical switching and single-photon blockade devices. in this paper, we review and compare the results of a series of experiments on polariton-polariton interactions in gaas/al$_x$ga$_{-1x}$as microcavity polariton structures, and present new theoretical analysis of these experiments. we show that not just the energy shift of the spectral lines, but also the results of measurements sensitive to the polariton scattering rate are important for the calibration of the interaction parameter at low excitation density. we find that when adjustments are made to correct for new understanding of the experiments, the value of the interaction parameter at low density is lower than previous reported, but still significantly higher than theoretically predicted."
