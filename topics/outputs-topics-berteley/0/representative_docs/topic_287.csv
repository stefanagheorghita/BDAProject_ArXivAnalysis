"collapse and fragmentation of magnetic molecular cloud cores with the enzo amr mhd code. ii. prolate and oblate cores. we present the results of a large suite of three-dimensional (3d) models of the collapse of magnetic molecular cloud cores using the adaptive mesh refinement (amr) code enzo2.2 in the ideal magnetohydrodynamics (mhd) approximation. the cloud cores are initially either prolate or oblate, centrally condensed clouds with masses of 1.73 or 2.73 $m_\odot$, respectively. the radial density profiles are gaussian, with central densities 20 times higher than boundary densities. a barotropic equation of state is used to represent the transition from low density, isothermal phases, to high density, optically thick phases. the initial magnetic field strength ranges from 6.3 to 100 $\mu$g, corresponding to clouds that are strongly to marginally supercritical, respectively, in terms of the mass to magnetic flux ratio. the magnetic field is initially uniform and aligned with the clouds' rotation axes, with initial ratios of rotational to gravitational energy ranging from $10^{-4}$ to 0.1. two significantly different outcomes for collapse result: (1) formation of single protostars with spiral arms, and (2) fragmentation into multiple protostar systems. the transition between these two outcomes depends primarily on the initial magnetic field strength, with fragmentation occurring for mass to flux ratios greater than about 14 times the critical ratio for prolate clouds. oblate clouds typically fragment into several times more clumps than prolate clouds. multiple, rather than binary, system formation is the general rule in either case, suggesting that binary stars are primarily the result of the orbital dissolution of multiple protostar systems."
"turbulent fragmentation as the primary driver of core formation in polaris flare and lupus i. stars form from dense cores in turbulent molecular clouds. according to the standard scenario of star formation, dense cores are created by cloud fragmentation. however, the physical mechanisms driving this process are still not fully understood from an observational standpoint. however, the physical mechanisms driving this process are still not fully understood from an observational standpoint. our goal is to investigate the process of cloud fragmentation using observational data from nearby clouds. specifically, we aim to examine the role of self-gravity and turbulence, both of which are key to the dynamical evolution of clouds. we applied astrodendro to the herschel h2 column density maps to identify dense cores and determine their mass and separation in two nearby low-mass clouds: the polaris flare and lupus i clouds. we then compared the observed core masses and separations with predictions from models of gravitational and turbulent fragmentation. for turbulent fragmentation, the key scales are the cloud sonic scale and its corresponding mass. the average core masses are estimated to be 0.242 msun for lupus i and 0.276 msun for the polaris flare. the core separations peak at 0.1 - 0.2 pc in both clouds. these separations are significantly smaller than the jeans length but agree well with the cloud sonic scale. additionally, the density probability distribution functions of the dense cores follow log-normal distributions, which is consistent with the predictions of turbulent fragmentation. these findings suggest that the primary process driving core formation in the observed low-mass star-forming regions is not gravitational fragmentation but rather turbulent fragmentation. we found no evidence that filament fragmentation plays a significant role in the formation of dense cores."
"fragmentation and star formation in turbulent cores. we examine the conditions under which binary and multiple stars may form out of turbulent molecular cloud cores using high resolution 3-d, adaptive mesh refinement (amr) hydrodynamics (truelove et al., 1997, 1998; klein, 1999). we argue that previous conclusions on the conditions for cloud fragmentation have limited applicability, since they did not allow for the nonlinear density and velocity perturbations that are ubiquitous in molecular cloud cores. over the past year, we have begun to simulate the evolution of marginally stable, turbulent cores. these models have radii, masses, density contrasts, turbulent linewidths, and projected velocity gradients consistent with observations of low-mass molecular cloud cores. our models are evolved in time under self-gravitational hydrodynamics with amr using a barotropic equation of state that models the transition from an isothermal to an adiabatic equation of state. we examine several properties of the resulting protostellar fragments and discuss the qualitative nature of the fragmentation process in realistic cloud cores: the transition from single to binary and multiple stars; the formation of misaligned binary systems; and the role played by filament formation in the formation of stars."
