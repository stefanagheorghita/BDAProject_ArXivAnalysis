"asymptotic symmetry algebra of conformal gravity. we compute asymptotic symmetry algebras of conformal gravity. due to more general boundary conditions allowed in conformal gravity in comparison to those in einstein gravity, we can classify the corresponding algebras. the highest algebra for non-trivial boundary conditions is five dimensional and it leads to global geon solution with non-vanishing charges."
"discrete gravity models and loop quantum gravity: a short review. we review the relation between loop quantum gravity on a fixed graph and discrete models of gravity. we compare regge and twisted geometries, and discuss discrete actions based on twisted geometries and on the discretization of the plebanski action. we discuss the role of discrete geometries in the spin foam formalism, with particular attention to the definition of the simplicity constraints."
"quantum gravity from noncommutative spacetime. we review a novel and authentic way to quantize gravity. this novel approach is based on the fact that einstein gravity can be formulated in terms of a symplectic geometry rather than a riemannian geometry in the context of emergent gravity. an essential step for emergent gravity is to realize the equivalence principle, the most important property in the theory of gravity (general relativity), from u(1) gauge theory on a symplectic or poisson manifold. through the realization of the equivalence principle, which is an intrinsic property in symplectic geometry known as the darboux theorem or the moser lemma, one can understand how diffeomorphism symmetry arises from noncommutative u(1) gauge theory; thus, gravity can emerge from the noncommutative electromagnetism, which is also an interacting theory. as a consequence, a background-independent quantum gravity in which the prior existence of any spacetime structure is not a priori assumed but is defined by using the fundamental ingredients in quantum gravity theory can be formulated. this scheme for quantum gravity can be used to resolve many notorious problems in theoretical physics, such as the cosmological constant problem, to understand the nature of dark energy, and to explain why gravity is so weak compared to other forces. in particular, it leads to a remarkable picture of what matter is. a matter field, such as leptons and quarks, simply arises as a stable localized geometry, which is a topological object in the defining algebra (noncommutative $\star$-algebra) of quantum gravity."
