"operationalizing relevance in physics education: using a systems view to expand our conception of making physics relevant. a common hope of many physics educators and researchers is that students leave the course with a stronger sense that physics is relevant to them than when they entered the course. multiple survey measures have attempted to measure shifts in students' beliefs on the relevance of physics but frequently the results show a negative shift in students' beliefs and are often reported as a failure of students to ""see the relevance."" we challenge this interpretation by first operationalizing relevance as a construct by using existing theories on beliefs and attitudes. we utilize ecological systems theory to identify rich sites of relevance in students lives and present evidence to demonstrate the rich ways students are able to make relevant connections to physics. we then reflect on the implications of this expanded view on the limitations of past measures of relevance. we articulate how incorporating students' disciplinary ideas and expertise into the classroom can challenge previous deficit-framed narratives of students' abilities to find the relevance of physics."
"is agreeing with a gender stereotype correlated with the performance of female students in introductory physics?. several prior studies in introductory physics have found a gender gap on conceptual assessments such as the force concept inventory (fci) and the conceptual survey of electricity and magnetism (csem) with male students performing better than female students. moreover, prior studies in the context of mathematics have also found that activation of a negative stereotype about a group can lead to deteriorated performance of the stereotyped group. here, we describe two studies in which we investigated the impact of interventions on the gender gap on the fci and csem in large introductory physics courses at a large research university. in the first study, we investigated whether asking introductory physics students to indicate their gender immediately before taking the csem increased the gender gap compared to students who were not asked for this information. we found no difference in performance between male and female students in the two conditions. in the second study, conducted with several thousand introductory physics students, we investigated the prevalence of the belief that men generally perform better in physics than women and the extent to which this belief is correlated with the performance of both female and male students on the fci and the csem in introductory physics courses. we found that at the end of the year-long calculus-based introductory physics sequence, in which female students are significantly underrepresented, agreeing with a gender stereotype was correlated negatively with the performance of female students on the conceptual physics surveys. the fact that female students who agreed with the gender stereotype performed worse than female students who disagreed with it at the end of the year-long calculus-based physics course may partly be due to an increased stereotype threat that female students who agree with the stereotype may experience in this course."
"improving students' conceptual understanding of conductors and insulators. we examine the difficulties that introductory physics students, undergraduate physics majors, and physics graduate students have with concepts related to conductors and insulators covered in introductory physics by giving written tests and interviewing a subset of students. we find that even graduate students have serious difficulties with these concepts. we develop tutorials related to these topics and evaluate their effectiveness by comparing the performance on written pre-/post-tests and interviews of students who received traditional instruction vs. those who learned using tutorials."
