"progressive residual learning for single image dehazing. the recent physical model-free dehazing methods have achieved state-of-the-art performances. however, without the guidance of physical models, the performances degrade rapidly when applied to real scenarios due to the unavailable or insufficient data problems. on the other hand, the physical model-based methods have better interpretability but suffer from multi-objective optimizations of parameters, which may lead to sub-optimal dehazing results. in this paper, a progressive residual learning strategy has been proposed to combine the physical model-free dehazing process with reformulated scattering model-based dehazing operations, which enjoys the merits of dehazing methods in both categories. specifically, the global atmosphere light and transmission maps are interactively optimized with the aid of accurate residual information and preliminary dehazed restorations from the initial physical model-free dehazing process. the proposed method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods on public dehazing benchmarks with better model interpretability and adaptivity for complex hazy data."
"illumination controllable dehazing network based on unsupervised retinex embedding. on the one hand, the dehazing task is an illposedness problem, which means that no unique solution exists. on the other hand, the dehazing task should take into account the subjective factor, which is to give the user selectable dehazed images rather than a single result. therefore, this paper proposes a multi-output dehazing network by introducing illumination controllable ability, called ic-dehazing. the proposed ic-dehazing can change the illumination intensity by adjusting the factor of the illumination controllable module, which is realized based on the interpretable retinex theory. moreover, the backbone dehazing network of ic-dehazing consists of a transformer with double decoders for high-quality image restoration. further, the prior-based loss function and unsupervised training strategy enable ic-dehazing to complete the parameter learning process without the need for paired data. to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ic-dehazing, quantitative and qualitative experiments are conducted on image dehazing, semantic segmentation, and object detection tasks. code is available at https://github.com/xiaofeng-life/icdehazing."
"a new multi-level hazy image and video dataset for benchmark of dehazing methods. the changing level of haze is one of the main factors which affects the success of the proposed dehazing methods. however, there is a lack of controlled multi-level hazy dataset in the literature. therefore, in this study, a new multi-level hazy color image dataset is presented. color video data is captured for two real scenes with a controlled level of haze. the distance of the scene objects from the camera, haze level, and ground truth (clear image) are available so that different dehazing methods and models can be benchmarked. in this study, the dehazing performance of five different dehazing methods/models is compared on the dataset based on ssim, psnr, vsi and dists image quality metrics. results show that traditional methods can generalize the dehazing problem better than many deep learning based methods. the performance of deep models depends mostly on the scene and is generally poor on cross-dataset dehazing."
