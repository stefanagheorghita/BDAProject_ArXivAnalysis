"the last zero crossing of an iterated brownian motion with drift. in this paper we consider the iterated brownian motion $ ^{\mu_1}_{\mu_2}\!i(t) = b_1^{\mu_1} ( | b_{2}^{\mu_2} (t)|) $ where $b_j^{\mu_j} , j=1,2$ are two independent brownian motions with drift $\mu_j$. here we study the last zero crossing of $ ^{\mu_1}_{\mu_2}\!i(t) $ and for this purpose we derive the last zero-crossing distribution of the drifted brownian motion. we derive also the joint distribution of the last zero crossing before $ t $ and of the first passage time through the zero level of a brownian motion with drift $ \mu $ after $ t $. all these results permit us to derive explicit formulas for ${^i_\mu t_0} = \sup \{ s < \max_{0\leq z\leq t} |b_2(z)| : b_1^\mu (s) = 0 \}$. also the iterated zero-crossing $ {^{\mu_1} t}_{0, {^{\mu_2} t}_{0,t}} $ is analyzed and extended to the case where the level of nesting is arbitrary."
"hitting distributions of geometric brownian motion. let $\tau$ be the first hitting time of the point 1 by the geometric brownian motion $x(t)= x \exp(b(t)-2\mu t)$ with drift $\mu \geq 0$ starting from $x>1$. here $b(t)$ is the brownian motion starting from 0 with $e^0 b^2(t) = 2t$. we provide an integral formula for the density function of the stopped exponential functional $a(\tau)=\int_0^\tau x^2(t) dt$ and determine its asymptotic behaviour at infinity. although we basically rely on methods developed in \cite{bgs}, the present paper also covers the case of arbitrary drifts $\mu \geq 0$ and provides a significant unification and extension of results of the above-mentioned paper. as a corollary we provide an integral formula and give asymptotic behaviour at infinity of the poisson kernel for half-spaces for brownian motion with drift in real hyperbolic spaces of arbitrary dimension."
"distance between two skew brownian motions as a sde with jumps and law of the hitting time. in this paper, we consider two skew brownian motions, driven by the same brownian motion, with different starting points and different skewness coefficients. we show that we can describe the evolution of the distance between the two processes with a stochastic differential equation. this s.d.e. possesses a jump component driven by the excursion process of one of the two skew brownian motions. using this representation, we show that the local time of two skew brownian motions at their first hitting time is distributed as a simple function of a beta random variable. this extends a result by burdzy and chen (2001), where the law of coalescence of two skew brownian motions with the same skewness coefficient is computed."
