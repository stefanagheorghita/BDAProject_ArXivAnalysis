"fundus-enhanced disease-aware distillation model for retinal disease classification from oct images. optical coherence tomography (oct) is a novel and effective screening tool for ophthalmic examination. since collecting oct images is relatively more expensive than fundus photographs, existing methods use multi-modal learning to complement limited oct data with additional context from fundus images. however, the multi-modal framework requires eye-paired datasets of both modalities, which is impractical for clinical use. to address this problem, we propose a novel fundus-enhanced disease-aware distillation model (fddm), for retinal disease classification from oct images. our framework enhances the oct model during training by utilizing unpaired fundus images and does not require the use of fundus images during testing, which greatly improves the practicality and efficiency of our method for clinical use. specifically, we propose a novel class prototype matching to distill disease-related information from the fundus model to the oct model and a novel class similarity alignment to enforce consistency between disease distribution of both modalities. experimental results show that our proposed approach outperforms single-modal, multi-modal, and state-of-the-art distillation methods for retinal disease classification. code is available at https://github.com/xmed-lab/fddm."
"transfer learning through weighted loss function and group normalization for vessel segmentation from retinal images. the vascular structure of blood vessels is important in diagnosing retinal conditions such as glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy. accurate segmentation of these vessels can help in detecting retinal objects such as the optic disc and optic cup and hence determine if there are damages to these areas. moreover, the structure of the vessels can help in diagnosing glaucoma. the rapid development of digital imaging and computer-vision techniques has increased the potential for developing approaches for segmenting retinal vessels. in this paper, we propose an approach for segmenting retinal vessels that uses deep learning along with transfer learning. we adapted the u-net structure to use a customized inceptionv3 as the encoder and used multiple skip connections to form the decoder. moreover, we used a weighted loss function to handle the issue of class imbalance in retinal images. furthermore, we contributed a new dataset to this field. we tested our approach on six publicly available datasets and a newly created dataset. we achieved an average accuracy of 95.60% and a dice coefficient of 80.98%. the results obtained from comprehensive experiments demonstrate the robustness of our approach to the segmentation of blood vessels in retinal images obtained from different sources. our approach results in greater segmentation accuracy than other approaches."
"application of deep learning in fundus image processing for ophthalmic diagnosis -- a review. an overview of the applications of deep learning in ophthalmic diagnosis using retinal fundus images is presented. we also review various retinal image datasets that can be used for deep learning purposes. applications of deep learning for segmentation of optic disk, blood vessels and retinal layer as well as detection of lesions are reviewed. recent deep learning models for classification of diseases such as age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma,diabetic macular edema and diabetic retinopathy are also reported."
