"thermal desorption of circumstellar and cometary ice analogs. thermal annealing of interstellar ices takes place in several stages of star formation. knowledge of this process comes from a combination of astronomical observations and laboratory simulations under astrophysically relevant conditions. for the first time we present the results of temperature programmed desorption (tpd) experiments with pre-cometary ice analogs composed of up to five molecular components: h2 o, co, co2, ch3 oh, and nh3 . the experiments were performed with an ultra-high vacuum chamber. a gas line with a novel design allows the controlled preparation of mixtures with up to five molecular components. volatiles desorbing to the gas phase were monitored using a quadrupole mass spectrometer, while changes in the ice structure and composition were studied by means of infrared spectroscopy. the tpd curves of water ice containing co, co2, ch3 oh, and nh3 present desorption peaks at temperatures near those observed in pure ice experiments, volcano desorption peaks after water ice crystallization, and co-desorption peaks with water. desorption peaks of ch3 oh and nh3 at temperatures similar to the pure ices takes place when their abundance relative to water is above 3%, approx., in the ice matrix. we found that co, co2, and nh3 also present co-desorption peaks with ch3 oh, which cannot be reproduced in experiments with binary water-rich ice mixtures. these are extensively used in the study of thermal desorption of interstellar ices. these results reproduce the heating of circumstellar ices in hot cores and can be also applied to the late thermal evo- lution of comets. in particular, tpd curves represent a benchmark for the analysis of the measurements that mass spectrometers on board the esa-rosetta cometary mission will perform on the coma of comet 67p/churyumov-gerasimenko, which will be active before the arrival of rosetta according to our predictions."
"on simulating the proton-irradiation of o$_2$ and h$_2$o ices using astrochemical-type models, with implications for bulk reactivity. many astrochemical models today explicitly consider the species that comprise the bulk of interstellar dust grain ice-mantles separately from those in the top few monolayers. bombardment of these ices by ionizing radiation - whether in the form of cosmic rays, stellar winds, or radionuclide emission - represents an astrochemically viable means of driving a rich chemistry even in the bulk of the ice-mantle, now supported by a large body of work in laboratory astrophysics. in this study, using an existing rate equation-based astrochemical code modified to include a method of considering radiation chemistry recently developed by us, we attempted to simulate two such studies in which (a) pure o$_2$ ice at 5 k and, (b) pure h$_2$o ice at 16 k and 77 k, were bombarded by kev h$^+$ ions. our aims are twofold: (1) to test the capability of our newly developed method to replicate the results of ice-irradiation experiments, and (2) to determine in such a well-constrained system how bulk chemistry is best handled using the same gas-grain codes that are used to model the interstellar medium (ism). we find that our modified astrochemical model is able to reproduce both the abundance of o$_3$ in the 5 k pure o$_2$ ice, as well as both the abundance of h$_2$o$_2$ in the 16 k water ice and the previously noted decrease of hydrogen peroxide at higher temperatures. however, these results require the assumption that radicals and other reactive species produced via radiolysis react quickly and non-diffusively with neighbors in the ice."
"organic chemistry in the h2-bearing, co-rich interstellar ice layer at temperatures relevant to dense cloud interiors. ice chemistry in the dense, cold interstellar medium (ism) is probably responsible for the formation of interstellar complex organic molecules (coms). recent laboratory experiments performed at t=4 k have shown that irradiation of co:n2 ice samples analog to the co-rich interstellar ice layer can contribute to the formation of coms when h2 molecules are present. we have tested this organic chemistry under a broader range of conditions relevant to the interior of dense clouds by irradiating co:15n2:h2 ice samples with 2 kev electrons in the 4-15 k temperature range. the h2 ice abundance depended on both, the ice formation temperature and the thermal evolution of the samples. formation of h-bearing organics such as formaldehyde (h2co), ketene (c2h2o), and isocyanic acid (h15nco) was observed upon irradiation of ice samples formed at temperatures up to 10 k, and also in ices formed at 6 k and subsequently warmed up and irradiated at temperatures up to 15 k. these results suggest that a fraction of the h2 molecules in dense cloud interiors might be entrapped in the co-rich layer of interstellar ice mantles, and that energetic processing of this layer could entail an additional contribution to the formation of coms in the coldest regions of the ism."
