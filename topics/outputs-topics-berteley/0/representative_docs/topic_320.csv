"the forgotten document-oriented database management systems: an overview and benchmark of native xml dodbmses in comparison with json dodbmses. in the current context of big data, a multitude of new nosql solutions for storing, managing, and extracting information and patterns from semi-structured data have been proposed and implemented. these solutions were developed to relieve the issue of rigid data structures present in relational databases, by introducing semi-structured and flexible schema design. as current data generated by different sources and devices, especially from iot sensors and actuators, use either xml or json format, depending on the application, database technologies that store and query semi-structured data in xml format are needed. thus, native xml databases, which were initially designed to manipulate xml data using standardized querying languages, i.e., xquery and xpath, were rebranded as nosql document-oriented databases systems. currently, the majority of these solutions have been replaced with the more modern json based database management systems. however, we believe that xml-based solutions can still deliver performance in executing complex queries on heterogeneous collections. unfortunately nowadays, research lacks a clear comparison of the scalability and performance for database technologies that store and query documents in xml versus the more modern json format. moreover, to the best of our knowledge, there are no big data-compliant benchmarks for such database technologies. in this paper, we present a comparison for selected document-oriented database systems that either use the xml format to encode documents, i.e., basex, exist-db, and sedna, or the json format, i.e., mongodb, couchdb, and couchbase. to underline the performance differences we also propose a benchmark that uses a heterogeneous complex schema on a large dblp corpus."
"answering sparql queries modulo rdf schema with paths. sparql is the standard query language for rdf graphs. in its strict instantiation, it only offers querying according to the rdf semantics and would thus ignore the semantics of data expressed with respect to (rdf) schemas or (owl) ontologies. several extensions to sparql have been proposed to query rdf data modulo rdfs, i.e., interpreting the query with rdfs semantics and/or considering external ontologies. we introduce a general framework which allows for expressing query answering modulo a particular semantics in an homogeneous way. in this paper, we discuss extensions of sparql that use regular expressions to navigate rdf graphs and may be used to answer queries considering rdfs semantics. we also consider their embedding as extensions of sparql. these sparql extensions are interpreted within the proposed framework and their drawbacks are presented. in particular, we show that the psparql query language, a strict extension of sparql offering transitive closure, allows for answering sparql queries modulo rdfs graphs with the same complexity as sparql through a simple transformation of the queries. we also consider languages which, in addition to paths, provide constraints. in particular, we present and compare nsparql and our proposal cpsparql. we show that cpsparql is expressive enough to answer full sparql queries modulo rdfs. finally, we compare the expressiveness and complexity of both nsparql and the corresponding fragment of cpsparql, that we call cpsparql. we show that both languages have the same complexity through cpsparql, being a proper extension of sparql graph patterns, is more expressive than nsparql."
"supporting sparql update queries in rdf-xml integration. the web of data encourages organizations and companies to publish their data according to the linked data practices and offer sparql endpoints. on the other hand, the dominant standard for information exchange is xml. the sparql2xquery framework focuses on the automatic translation of sparql queries in xquery expressions in order to access xml data across the web. in this paper, we outline our ongoing work on supporting update queries in the rdf-xml integration scenario."
