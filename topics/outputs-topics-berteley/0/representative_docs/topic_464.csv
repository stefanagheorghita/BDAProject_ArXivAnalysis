"spin wave storage using chirped control fields in atomic frequency comb based quantum memory. it has been shown that an inhomogeneously broadened optical transition shaped into an atomic frequency comb can store a large number of temporal modes of the electromagnetic field at the single photon level without the need to increase the optical depth of the storage material. the readout of light modes is made efficient thanks to the rephasing of the optical-wavelength coherence similarly to photon echo-type techniques and the re-emission time is given by the comb structure. for on-demand readout and long storage times, two control fields are used to transfer back and forth the optical coherence into a spin wave. here, we present a detailed analysis of the spin wave storage based on chirped adiabatic control fields. in particular, we verify that chirped fields require significantly weaker intensities than $\pi$-pulses. the price to pay is a reduction of the multimode storage capacity that we quantify for realistic material parameters associated with solids doped with rare-earth-metal ions."
"optimal squeezing in resonance fluorescence via atomic-state purification. squeezing of atomic resonance fluorescence is shown to be optimized by a properly designed environment, which can be realized by a quasi-resonant cavity. optimal squeezing is achieved if the atomic coherence is maximized, corresponding to a pure atomic quantum state. the atomic-state purification is achieved by the backaction of the cavity field on the atom, which increases the atomic coherence and decreases the atomic excitation. for realistic cavities, the coupling of the atom to the cavity field yields a purity of the atomic state of more than 99%. the fragility of squeezing against dephasing is substantially reduced in this scenario, which may be important for various applications."
"multimode amplitude squeezing through cascaded nonlinear optical processes. multimode squeezed light is enticing for several applications, from squeezed frequency combs for spectroscopy to signal multiplexing in optical computing. to generate squeezing in multiple frequency modes, optical parametric oscillators have been vital in realizing multimode squeezed vacuum states through second-order nonlinear processes. however, most work has focused on generating multimode squeezed vacua and squeezing in mode superpositions (supermodes). bright squeezing in multiple discrete frequency modes, if realized, could unlock novel applications in quantum-enhanced spectroscopy and optical quantum computing. here, we show how $q$ factor engineering of a multimode nonlinear cavity with cascaded three wave mixing processes creates strong, spectrally tunable single mode output amplitude noise squeezing over 10 db below the shot noise limit. in addition, we demonstrate squeezing for multiple discrete frequency modes above threshold. this bright squeezing arises from enhancement of the (noiseless) nonlinear rate relative to decay rates in the system due to the cascaded generation of photons in a single idler ""bath"" mode. a natural consequence of the strong nonlinear coupling in our system is the creation of an effective cavity in the synthetic frequency dimension that sustains bloch oscillations in the modal energy distribution. bloch mode engineering could provide an opportunity to better control nonlinear energy flow in the synthetic frequency dimension, with exciting applications in quantum random walks and topological photonics. lastly, we show evidence of long-range correlations in amplitude noise between discrete frequency modes, pointing towards the potential of long-range entanglement in a synthetic frequency dimension."
