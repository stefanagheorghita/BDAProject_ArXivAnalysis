"quarkonium in-medium transport equation derived from first principles. we use the open quantum system formalism to study the dynamical in-medium evolution of quarkonium. the system of quarkonium is described by potential non-relativistic qcd while the environment is a weakly coupled quark-gluon plasma in local thermal equilibrium below the melting temperature of the quarkonium. under the markovian approximation, it is shown that the lindblad equation leads to a boltzmann transport equation if a wigner transform is applied to the system density matrix. our derivation illuminates how the microscopic time-reversibility of qcd is consistent with the time-irreversible in-medium evolution of quarkonium states. static screening, dissociation and recombination of quarkonium are treated in the same theoretical framework. in addition, quarkonium annihilation is included in a similar way, although the effect is negligible for the phenomenology of the current heavy ion collision experiments. the methods used here can be extended to study quarkonium dynamical evolution inside a strongly coupled qgp, a hot medium out of equilibrium or cold nuclear matter, which is important to studying quarkonium production in heavy ion, proton-ion, and electron-ion collisions."
"heavy flavor transport in the qgp medium. i review recent developments on heavy flavor transport in the qgp medium, along two directions. the first is the transport of individual open heavy quarks. leveraging the tools of heavy quark effective theory, recent work revealed a novel connection between the evolution equation of the heavy quark phase space distribution, the conditions for kinetic equilibration to take place, and a non-perturbatively defined expectation value of a wilson loop characterized by the heavy quark velocity. using these developments, i discuss results from a first exploration of the ensuing stopping and equilibration dynamics of heavy quarks in a strongly coupled environment. the second direction is the transport of quarkonia, bound states of heavy quarks, where novel generalized gluon distributions have been recently defined and calculated in the framework of potential non-relativistic qcd. i discuss their application to the dynamics of quarkonium in heavy-ion collisions, highlighting the need to account for non-markovian effects in the interactions between the heavy quark pair and quark-gluon plasma -- which have thus far resisted a systematic characterization."
"quarkonium spectral functions in a bulk-viscous quark-gluon plasma. we study the interplay of non-equilibrium properties of a quark-gluon plasma (qgp) and heavy quarkonia. for this purpose, we compute the quarkonium spectral functions in a bulk-viscous qgp. we take into account the bulk viscous nature of the medium by modifying the distribution functions of thermal quarks and gluons. this modification affects the dielectric permittivity, which is used to calculate the in-medium heavy quark potential. with this modified complex potential, we calculate the quarkonium spectral functions and extract their physical properties. we discuss the impact of bulk viscosity on quarkonia properties such as decay widths and binding energies. we also estimate the relative production yield of $ \psi' $ to $ j/\psi $ and discuss the bulk viscous effects on it."
