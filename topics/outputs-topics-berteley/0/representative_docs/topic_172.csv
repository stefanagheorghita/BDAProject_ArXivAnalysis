"the gaia-eso survey: kinematics of seven galactic globular clusters. the gaia-eso survey is a large public spectroscopic survey aimed at investigating the origin and formation history of our galaxy by collecting spectroscopy of representative samples (about 10^5 milky way stars) of all galactic stellar populations, in the field and in clusters. the survey uses globular clusters as intra- and inter-survey calibrators, deriving stellar atmospheric parameters and abundances of a significant number of stars in clusters, along with radial velocity determinations. we used precise radial velocities of a large number of stars in seven globular clusters (ngc 1851, ngc 2808, ngc 4372, ngc 4833, ngc 5927, ngc 6752, and ngc 7078) to validate pipeline results and to preliminarily investigate the cluster internal kinematics. radial velocity measurements were extracted from flames/giraffe spectra processed by the survey pipeline as part of the second internal data release of data products to eso. we complemented our sample with eso archival data obtained with different instrument configurations. reliable radial velocity measurements for 1513 bona fide cluster star members were obtained in total. we measured systemic rotation, estimated central velocity dispersions, and present velocity dispersion profiles of all the selected clusters, providing the first velocity dispersion curve and the first estimate of the central velocity dispersion for the cluster ngc~5927. finally, we explore the possible link between cluster kinematics and other physical parameters. the analysis we present here demonstrates that gaia-eso survey data are sufficiently accurate to be used in studies of kinematics of stellar systems and stellar populations in the milky way."
"population parameters of intermediate-age star clusters in the large magellanic cloud. iii. dynamical evidence for a range of ages being responsible for extended main sequence turnoffs. we present new analysis of 11 intermediate-age (1-2 gyr) star clusters in the large magellanic cloud based on hubble space telescope imaging data. seven of the clusters feature main sequence turnoff (msto) regions that are wider than can be accounted for by a simple stellar population, whereas their red giant branches indicate a single value of [fe/h]. the star clusters cover a range in present-day mass from about 1e4 to 2e5 solar masses. we compare radial distributions of stars in the upper and lower parts of the msto region, and calculate cluster masses and escape velocities from the present time back to a cluster age of 10 myr. our main result is that for all clusters in our sample with estimated escape velocities > 15 km/s at an age of 10 myr, the stars in the brightest half of the msto region are significantly more centrally concentrated than the stars in the faintest half and more massive red giant branch and asymptotic giant branch stars. this is not the case for clusters with escape velocities < 10 km/s at an age of 10 myr. we argue that the wide msto region of such clusters is mainly caused by to a 200 - 500 myr range in the ages of cluster stars due to extended star formation within the cluster from material shed by first-generation stars featuring slow stellar winds. dilution of this enriched material by accretion of ambient interstellar matter is deemed plausible if the spread of [fe/h] in this ambient gas was very small when the second-generation stars were formed in the cluster."
"simulations of globular cluster evolution with multiple stellar populations. the formation of stars with light-element abundance variations in globular clusters and the subsequent dynamical evolution of these multiple populations remains an open question. one of the most widely discussed is the agb scenario, in which chemically processed material from the envelopes of agb stars mixes with re-accreted primordial gas flowing into the center of the cluster. based on this scenario, more than two hundred mocca simulations of cluster evolution have been carried out, incorporating additional physical processes related to the external environment of globular clusters and the initial properties of multiple stellar populations. analysis of the simulations shows that most observed properties of multiple stellar populations and the global parameters of milky way clusters are well reproduced, with the exception of the correlation between cluster mass and the fraction of second-population stars. we present a speculative scenario of globular cluster evolution that may account for the observed properties of milky way clusters, including the correlation between cluster mass and the fraction of enriched stars. the scenario further predicts that, under certain conditions, the pristine first population can be more centrally concentrated than the enriched second population, as observed in some clusters. \end{abstract"
