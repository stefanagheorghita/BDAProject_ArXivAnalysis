"characterizing adiabaticity in quantum many-body systems at finite temperature. the quantum adiabatic theorem is fundamental to time dependent quantum systems, but being able to characterize quantitatively an adiabatic evolution in many-body systems can be a challenge. this work demonstrates that the use of appropriate state and particle-density metrics is a viable method to quantitatively determine the degree of adiabaticity in the dynamic of a quantum many-body system. the method applies also to systems at finite temperature, which is important for quantum technologies and quantum thermodynamics related protocols. the importance of accounting for memory effects is discussed via comparison to results obtained by extending the quantum adiabatic criterion to finite temperatures: it is shown that this may produce false readings being quasi-markovian by construction. as the proposed method makes it possible to characterize the degree of adiabatic evolution tracking only the system local particle densities, it is potentially applicable to both theoretical calculations of very large many-body systems and to experiments."
"eigenstate tracking in open quantum systems. keeping a quantum system in a given instantaneous eigenstate is a control problem with numerous applications, e.g., in quantum information processing. the problem is even more challenging in the setting of open quantum systems, where environment-mediated transitions introduce additional decoherence channels. adiabatic passage is a well established solution, but requires a sufficiently slow evolution time that is dictated by the adiabatic theorem. here we develop a systematic projection theory formulation for the transitionless evolution of general open quantum systems described by time-local master equations. we derive a time-convolutionless dynamical equation for the target instantaneous eigenstate of a given time-dependent hamiltonian. a transitionless dynamics then arises in terms of a competition between the average hamiltonian gap and the decoherence rate, which implies optimal adiabaticity timescales. we show how eigenstate tracking can be accomplished via control pulses, without explicitly incorporating counter-diabatic driving, thus offering an alternative route to shortcuts to adiabaticity. we examine rectangular pulses, chaotic signals, and white noise, and find that, remarkably, the effectiveness of eigenstate tracking hardly depends on the details of the control functions. in all cases the control protocol keeps the system in the desired instantaneous eigenstate throughout the entire evolution, along an accelerated adiabatic path."
"nonadiabatic quantum state engineering driven by fast quench dynamics. there are a number of tasks in quantum information science that exploit non-transitional adiabatic dynamics. such a dynamics is bounded by the adiabatic theorem, which naturally imposes a speed limit in the evolution of quantum systems. here, we investigate an approach for quantum state engineering exploiting a shortcut to the adiabatic evolution, which is based on rapid quenches in a continuous-time hamiltonian evolution. in particular, this procedure is able to provide state preparation faster than the adiabatic brachistochrone. remarkably, the evolution time in this approach is shown to be ultimately limited by its ""thermodynamical cost,""provided in terms of the average work rate (average power) of the quench process. we illustrate this result in a scenario that can be experimentally implemented in a nuclear magnetic resonance setup."
