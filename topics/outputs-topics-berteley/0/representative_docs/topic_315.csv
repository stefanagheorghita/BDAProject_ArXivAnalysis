"effects of dust sources on dust attenuation properties in illustristng galaxies at $z\sim 7$. dust emission from high-redshift galaxies gives us a clue to the origin and evolution of dust in the early universe. previous studies have shown that different sources of dust (stellar dust production and dust growth in dense clouds) predict different ultraviolet (uv) extinction curves for galaxies at $z\sim 7$ but that the observed attenuation curves depend strongly on the geometry of dust and star distributions. thus, we perform radiative transfer calculations under the dust-stars geometries computed by a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation (illustristng). this serves to investigate the dust attenuation curves predicted from `realistic' geometries. we choose objects with stellar mass and star formation rate appropriate for lyman break galaxies at $z\sim 7$. we find that the attenuation curves are very different from the original extinction curves in most of the galaxies. this makes it difficult to constrain the dominant dust sources from the observed attenuation curves. we further include infrared dust emission in the analysis and plot the infrared excess (irx)-uv spectral slope ($\beta$) diagram. we find that different sources of dust cause different irx-$\beta$ relations for the simulated galaxies. in particular, if dust growth is the main source of dust, a variation of dust-to-metal ratio causes a more extended sequence with smaller irx in the irx-$\beta$ diagram. thus, the comprehensive analysis of the abundances of dust and metals, the uv slope, and the dust emission could provide a clue to the dominant dust sources in the universe."
"spectral energy distributions of an akari-sdss-galex sample of galaxies. the nearby universe remains the best laboratory to understand physical properties of galaxies and is a reference for any comparison with high redshift observations. the all sky (or very large) surveys performed from the ultraviolet (uv) to the far-infrared (far-ir) gives us large datasets with a very large wavelength coverage to perform a reference study. we want to investigate dust attenuation characteristics as well as star formation rate (sfr) calibrations on a sample of nearby galaxies observed over 13 bands from 0.15 to 160 microns. a sample of 363 galaxies is built from the akari /fis all sky survey cross-correlated with sdss and galex surveys. broad band spectral energy distributions are fitted with the cigale code optimized to analyze variations in dust attenuation curves and sfr measurements and based on an energetic budget between the stellar and dust emission. our galaxy sample is primarily selected in far-ir and mostly constituted of massive, actively star forming galaxies. there is some evidence for a dust attenuation law slightly steeper than that used for starburst galaxies but we are unable to constrain the presence or not of a bump at 220 nm. we confirm that a time dependent dust attenuation is necessary to perform the best fits. various calibrations of the dust attenuation in the uv as a function of uv-optical colours are discussed. a calibration of the current star formation rate combining uv and total ir emissions is proposed with an accurate estimation of dust heating by old stars: for the whole sample 17 % of the total dust luminosity is not related to the recent star formation"
"dust properties of lyman break galaxies in cosmological simulations. recent observations have indicated the existence of dust in high-redshift galaxies, however, the dust properties in them are still unknown. here we present theoretical constraints on dust properties in lyman break galaxies (lbgs) at z=3 by post-processing a cosmological smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulation with radiative transfer calculations. we calculate the dust extinction in 2800 dark matter halos using the metallicity information of individual gas particles in our simulation. we use only bright galaxies with rest-frame uv magnitude m_1700 < -20 mag, and study the dust size, dust-to-metal mass ratio, and dust composition. from the comparison of calculated color excess between b and v-band (i.e., e(b-v)) and the observations, we constrain the typical dust size, and show that the best-fitting dust grain size is ~ 0.05 micron, which is consistent with the results of theoretical dust models for type-ii supernova. our simulation with the dust extinction effect can naturally reproduce the observed rest-frame uv luminosity function of lbgs at z=3 without assuming an ad hoc constant extinction value. in addition, in order to reproduce the observed mean e(b-v), we find that the dust-to-metal mass ratio needs to be similar to that of the local galaxies, and that the graphite dust is dominant or at least occupy half of dust mass."
