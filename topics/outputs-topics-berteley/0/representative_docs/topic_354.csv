"on large gaps between zeros of the riemann zeta-function. assuming the generalized riemann hypothesis(grh), we show that infinitely often consecutive non-trivial zeros of the riemann zeta-function differ by at least 3.072 times the average spacing."
"a simple proof of the riemann hypothesis. in this article, it is proved that the non-trivial zeros of the riemann zeta function must lie on the critical line, known as the riemann hypothesis."
"zeros of the riemann zeta function. in this paper, we present a proof of the riemann hypothesis. we show that zeros of the riemann zeta function should be on the line with the real value 1/2, in the region where the real part of complex variable is between 0 and 1."
