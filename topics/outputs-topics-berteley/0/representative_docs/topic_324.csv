"innovative method for proving iterative convergence of strictly nonexpansive operators in bounded domains. this paper makes substantial theoretical advancements in fixed point theory for strictly nonexpansive mappings. by developing an innovative proof technique, we successfully generalize the classical fixed-point theorem for strictly nonexpansive mappings originally established for compact sets to broader cases involving bounded sets. the key innovations lie in leveraging both the boundedness property of iterative sequences and the strict nonexpansiveness of mappings, which collectively enable us to significantly relax the conventional requirements of spatial convexity and compactness typically imposed on general nonexpansive mappings."
weak and strong convergence of an implicit iterative process with errors for a finite family of asymptotically quasi $i-$nonexpansive mappings in banach space. in this paper we prove the weak and strong convergence of the implicit iterative process with errors to a common fixed point of a finite family $\{t_j\}_{i=1}^n$ of asymptotically quasi $i_j-$nonexpansive mappings as well as a family of $\{i_j\}_{j=1}^n$ of asymptotically quasi nonexpansive mappings in the framework of banach spaces.
"a solution of variational inequality problem for a finite family of nonexpansive mappings in hilbert spaces. in this paper we prove the strong convergence of the explicit iterative process to a common fixed point of the finite family of nonexpansive mappings defined on hilbert space, which solves the the variational inequality on the fixed points set."
