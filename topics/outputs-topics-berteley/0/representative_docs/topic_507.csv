"thermoelectrics with coulomb coupled quantum dots. in this article we review the thermoelectric properties of three terminal devices with coulomb coupled quantum dots (qds) as observed in recent experiments [1,2]. the system we consider consists of two coulomb-blockade qds one of which can exchange electrons with only a single reservoir (heat reservoir) while the other dot is tunnel coupled to two reservoirs at a lower temperature (conductor). the heat reservoir and the conductor interact only via the coulomb-coupling of the quantum dots. it has been found that two regimes have to be considered. in the first one heat flow between the two systems is small. in this regime thermally driven occupation fluctuations of the hot qd modify the transport properties of the conductor system. this leads to an effect called thermal gating. experiment have shown how this can be used to control charge flow in the conductor by means of temperature in a remote reservoir. we further substantiate the observations with model calculations and implications for the realization of an all-thermal transistor are discussed. in the second regime, heat flow between the two systems is relevant. here the system works as a nano scale heat engine, as proposed recently [3]. we review the conceptual idea, its experimental realization and the novel features arising in this new kind of thermoelectric device such as decoupling of heat and charge flow."
"non-equilibrium thermoelectric transport across normal metal-quantum dot-superconductor hybrid system within the coulomb blockade regime. a detailed investigation of the non-equilibrium steady-state electric and thermoelectric transport properties of a quantum dot coupled to the normal metallic and s-wave superconducting reservoirs (n-qd-s) are provided within the coulomb blockade regime. using non-equilibrium keldysh green's function formalism, initially, various model parameter dependence of thermoelectric transport properties are analysed within the linear response regime. it is observed that the single-particle tunnelling close to the superconducting gap edge can generate a relatively large thermopower and figure of merit. moreover, the andreev tunnelling plays a significant role in the suppression of thermopower and figure of merit within the gap region. further, within the non-linear regime, we discuss two different situations, i.e., the finite voltage biasing between isothermal reservoirs and the finite thermal gradient in the context of thermoelectric heat engine. in the former case, it is shown that the sub-gap andreev heat current can become finite beyond the linear response regime and play a vital role in asymmetric heat dissipation and thermal rectification effect for low voltage biasing. the rectification of heat current is enhanced for strong on-dot coulomb interaction and at low background thermal energy. in the latter case, we study the variation of thermovoltage, thermopower, maximum power output, and corresponding efficiency with the applied thermal gradient. these results illustrate that hybrid superconductor-quantum dot nanostructures are promising candidatess for low-temperature thermal applications."
fano effect in a thermally induced transport through a triple quantum dot within the coulomb blockade regime. in the present work we theoretically study thermoelectric transport and heat transfer in a junction including a $t$-shaped double quantum dot coupled to nonmagnetic electrodes and supplemented with a third dot in a parallel configuration. we focus on the combined effect of coulomb interactions and quantum interference occurring in the $t$-shaped portion of the considered triple quantum dot on the thermoelectric electron transport. the transport through the system is studied within the coulomb blockade regime in the limit of strong intra-dot interactions between electrons beyond the linear response regime. it is shown that under these conditions both charge and heat transfer through the considered system may be significantly affected by the quantum interference and inter-dot coulomb interactions.
