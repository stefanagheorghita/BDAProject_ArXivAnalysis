generating extended mapping class groups with two periodic elements. the extended mapping class group of a surface $\sigma$ is defined to be the group of isotopy classes of (not necessarily orientation-preserving) homeomorphisms of $\sigma$. we are able to show that the extended mapping class group of an $n$-punctured sphere is generated by two elements of finite order exactly when $n\not=4$. we use this result to prove that the extended mapping class group of a genus 2 surface is generated by two elements of finite order.
"measure equivalence rigidity of the mapping class group. we show that the mapping class group of a compact orientable surface with higher complexity has the following extreme rigidity in the sense of measure equivalence: if the mapping class group is measure equivalent to a discrete group, then they are commensurable up to finite kernel. moreover, we describe all lattice embeddings of the mapping class group into a locally compact second countable group. we also obtain similar results for finite direct products of mapping class groups."
"all finite groups are involved in the mapping class group. let $\gamma_g$ denote the orientation-preserving mapping class group of the genus $g\geq 1$ closed orientable surface. in this paper we show that for fixed $g$, every finite group occurs as a quotient of a finite index subgroup of $\gamma_g$."
