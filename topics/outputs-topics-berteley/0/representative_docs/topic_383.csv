"chiral dark sector. we present a simple and natural dark sector model in which dark matter particles arise as composite states of hidden strong dynamics and their stability is ensured by accidental symmetries. the model has only a few free parameters. in particular, the gauge symmetry of the model forbids the masses of dark quarks, and the confinement scale of the dynamics provides the unique mass scale of the model. the gauge group contains an abelian symmetry $u(1)_d$, which couples the dark and standard model sectors through kinetic mixing. this model, despite its simple structure, has rich and distinctive phenomenology. in the case where the dark pion becomes massive due to $u(1)_d$ quantum corrections, direct and indirect detection experiments can probe thermal relic dark matter which is generically a mixture of the dark pion and the dark baryon, and the large hadron collider can discover the $u(1)_d$ gauge boson. alternatively, if the dark pion stays light due to a specific $u(1)_d$ charge assignment of the dark quarks, then the dark pion constitutes dark radiation. the signal of this radiation is highly correlated with that of dark baryons in dark matter direct detection."
"an alternative to the standard model. we present an extension of the standard model to dark sector with an unbroken local dark $u(1)_x$ symmetry. including various singlet portal interactions provided by the standard model higgs, right-handed neutrinos and kinetic mixing, we show that the model can address most of phenomenological issues (inflation, neutrino mass and mixing, baryon number asymmetry, dark matter, direct/indirect dark matter searches, some scale scale puzzles of the standard collisionless cold dark matter, vacuum stability of the standard model higgs potential, dark radiation) and be regarded as an alternative to the standard model. the higgs signal strength is equal to one as in the standard model for unbroken $u(1)_x$ case with a scalar dark matter, but it could be less than one independent of decay channels if the dark matter is a dark sector fermion or if $u(1)_x$ is spontaneously broken, because of a mixing with a new neutral scalar boson in the models."
"dark matter meets quantum gravity. we search for an extension of the standard model that contains a viable dark matter candidate and that can be embedded into a fundamental, asymptotically safe, quantum field theory with quantum gravity. demanding asymptotic safety leads to boundary conditions for the non-gravitational couplings at the planck scale. for a given dark matter model these translate into constraints on the mass of the dark matter candidate. we derive constraints on the dark matter mass and couplings in two minimal dark matter models: i) scalar dark matter coupled via the higgs-portal in the $b$-$l$ model; ii) fermionic dark matter in a $u(1)_x$ extension of the standard model, coupled via the new gauge boson. for scalar dark matter we find 56 gev $ < m_\text{dm} < 63$ gev, and for fermionic dark matter $m_\text{dm} \leq 50$ tev. within our framework, we identify three benchmark scenarios with distinct phenomenological consequences."
