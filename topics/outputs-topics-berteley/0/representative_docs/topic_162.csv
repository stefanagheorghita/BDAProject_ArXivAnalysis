"asymptotics and zeros of sobolev orthogonal polynomials on unbounded supports. in this paper we present a survey about analytic properties of polynomials orthogonal with respect to a weighted sobolev inner product such that the vector of measures has an unbounded support. in particular, we are focused in the study of the asymptotic behaviour of such polynomials as well as in the distribution of their zeros. some open problems as well as some new directions for a future research are formulated."
"orthogonal polynomials in the normal matrix model with a cubic potential. we consider the normal matrix model with a cubic potential. the model is ill-defined, and in order to reguralize it, elbau and felder introduced a model with a cut-off and corresponding system of orthogonal polynomials with respect to a varying exponential weight on the cut-off region on the complex plane. in the present paper we show how to define orthogonal polynomials on a specially chosen system of infinite contours on the complex plane, without any cut-off, which satisfy the same recurrence algebraic identity that is asymptotically valid for the orthogonal polynomials of elbau and felder. the main goal of this paper is to develop the riemann-hilbert (rh) approach to the orthogonal polynomials under consideration and to obtain their asymptotic behavior on the complex plane as the degree $n$ of the polynomial goes to infinity. as the first step in the rh approach, we introduce an auxiliary vector equilibrium problem for a pair of measures $(\mu_1,\mu_2)$ on the complex plane. we then formulate a $3\times 3$ matrix valued rh problem for the orthogonal polynomials in hand, and we apply the nonlinear steepest descent method of deift-zhou to the asymptotic analysis of the rh problem. the central steps in our study are a sequence of transformations of the rh problem, based on the equilibrium vector measure $(\mu_1,\mu_2)$, and the construction of a global parametrix. the main result of this paper is a derivation of the large $n$ asymptotics of the orthogonal polynomials on the whole complex plane. we prove that the distribution of zeros of the orthogonal polynomials converges to the measure $\mu_1$, the first component of the equilibrium measure. we also obtain analytical results for the measure $\mu_1$ relating it to the distribution of eigenvalues in the normal matrix model which is uniform in a domain bounded by a simple closed curve."
"orthogonality of quasi-orthogonal polynomials. a result of p\'olya states that every sequence of quadrature formulas $q_n(f)$ with $n$ nodes and positive numbers converges to the integral $i(f)$ of a continuous function $f$ provided $q_n(f)=i(f)$ for a space of algebraic polynomials of certain degree that depends on $n$. the classical case when the algebraic degree of precision is the highest possible is well-known and the quadrature formulas are the gaussian ones whose nodes coincide with the zeros of the corresponding orthogonal polynomials and the numbers are expressed in terms of the so-called kernel polynomials. in many cases it is reasonable to relax the requirement for the highest possible degree of precision in order to gain the possibility to either approximate integrals of more specific continuous functions that contain a polynomial factor or to include additional fixed nodes. the construction of such quadrature processes is related to quasi-orthogonal polynomials. given a sequence $\left \{ p_{n}\right \}_{n\geq0}$ of monic orthogonal polynomials and a fixed integer $k$, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions so that the quasi-orthogonal polynomials $\left \{ q_{n}\right \}_{n\geq0}$ defined by \[ q_{n}(x) =p_{n}(x) + \sum \limits_{i=1}^{k-1} b_{i,n}p_{n-i}(x), \ \ n\geq 0, \] with $b_{i,n} \in \mathbb{r}$, and $b_{k-1,n}\neq 0$ for $n\geq k-1$, also constitute a sequence of orthogonal polynomials. therefore we solve the inverse problem for linearly related orthogonal polynomials. the characterization turns out to be equivalent to some nice recurrence formulas for the coefficients $b_{i,n}$. we employ these results to establish explicit relations between various types of quadrature rules from the above relations. a number of illustrative examples are provided."
