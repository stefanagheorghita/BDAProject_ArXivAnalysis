"topological features of ground states and topological solitons in generalized su-schrieffer-heeger models using generalized time-reversal, particle-hole, and chiral symmetries. topological phases and their topological features are enriched by the fundamental time-reversal, particle-hole, and chiral as well as crystalline symmetries. while one-dimensional (1d) generalized su-schrieffer-heeger (ssh) systems show various topological phenomena such as topological solitons and topological charge pumping, it remains unclear how such symmetry protects and relates such topological phenomena. here we show that the generalized time-reversal, particle-hole, and chiral symmetry operators consistently explain not only the symmetry transformation properties between the ground states but also the topological features of the topological solitons in prototypical quasi-1d systems such as the ssh, rice-mele, and double-chain models. as a consequence, we classify generalized essential operators into three groups: class i and class ii operators connect ground states in between after spontaneous symmetry breaking while class iii operators give the generalized particle-hole and chiral symmetries to ground states. furthermore, class i operators endow the equivalence relation between topological solitons while class ii and iii operators do the particle-hole relations. finally, we demonstrate three distinct types of topological charge pumping and soliton chirality from the viewpoint of class i, ii, and iii operators. we build a general framework to explore the topological features of the generalized 1d electronic system, which can be easily applied in various condensed matter systems as well as photonic crystal and cold atomic systems."
"manifestation of a topological gapless phase in a two-dimensional chiral symmetric system through loschmidt echo. unlike the edge state of a topological insulator where its energy level lives in the bulk energy gap, the edge state of a topological semimetal hides in the bulk spectrum and is difficult to be identified by the energy. we investigate the sensitivity of bulk and edge states of the gapless phase for a topological semimetal to the disordered perturbation via a concrete two-dimensional chiral symmetric lattice model. the topological gapless phase is characterized by two opposite vortices in the momentum space and nonzero winding numbers, which correspond to the edge flatband when the open boundary condition is applied. for this system, numerical results reveal that a distinguishing feature is that the robustness of the edge states against weak disorder and the flatband edge modes remain locked at zero energy in the presence of weak chiral-symmetry-preserving disorder. we employ the loschmidt echo (le) for both bulk and edge states to study the dynamic effect of disordered perturbation. we show that, for an initial bulk state, the le decays exponentially, whereas it converges to a constant for an initial edge state in the presence of weak disorder. furthermore, the convergent le can be utilized to identify the positions of vortices as well as the phase diagram. we discuss the realization of such dynamic investigations in a topological photonic system."
"constructing higher-order topological states in higher dimension. higher-order topological phase as a generalization of berry phase attracts an enormous amount of research. the current theoretical models supporting higher-order topological phases, however, cannot give the connection between lower and higher-order topological phases when extending the lattice from lower to higher dimensions. here, we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate a topological corner state constructed from the edge states in one dimensional lattice. the two-dimensional square lattice owns independent spatial modulation of coupling in each direction, and the combination of edge states in each direction come up to the higher-order topological corner state in two-dimensional lattice, revealing the connection of topological phase in lower and higher dimensional lattices. moreover, the topological corner states in two-dimensional lattice can also be viewed as the dimension-reduction from a four-dimensional topological phase characterized by vector chern number, considering two modulation phases as synthetic dimensions in aubry-andre-harper model discussed as example here. our work deeps the understanding to topological phases breaking through the lattice dimension, and provides a promising tool constructing higher topological phases in higher dimensional structures."
