introduction to quantum lie algebras. quantum lie algebras are generalizations of lie algebras whose structure constants are power series in $h$. they are derived from the quantized enveloping algebras $\uqg$. the quantum lie bracket satisfies a generalization of antisymmetry. representations of quantum lie algebras are defined in terms of a generalized commutator. in this paper the recent general results about quantum lie algebras are introduced with the help of the explicit example of $(sl_2)_h$.
"z$_3$-graded differential geometry of quantum plane. in this work, the z$_3$-graded differential geometry of the quantum plane is constructed. the corresponding quantum lie algebra and its hopf algebra structure are obtained. the dual algebra, i.e. universal enveloping algebra of the quantum plane is explicitly constructed and an isomorphism between the quantum lie algebra and the dual algebra is given."
"quantum lie algebras; their existence, uniqueness and $q$-antisymmetry. quantum lie algebras are generalizations of lie algebras which have the quantum parameter h built into their structure. they have been defined concretely as certain submodules of the quantized enveloping algebras. on them the quantum lie bracket is given by the quantum adjoint action. here we define for any finite-dimensional simple complex lie algebra g an abstract quantum lie algebra g_h independent of any concrete realization. its h-dependent structure constants are given in terms of inverse quantum clebsch-gordan coefficients. we then show that all concrete quantum lie algebras are isomorphic to an abstract quantum lie algebra g_h. in this way we prove two important properties of quantum lie algebras: 1) all quantum lie algebras associated to the same g are isomorphic, 2) the quantum lie bracket of any quantum lie algebra is $q$-antisymmetric. we also describe a construction of quantum lie algebras which establishes their existence."
