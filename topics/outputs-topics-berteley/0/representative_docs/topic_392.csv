"learning the shape of protein micro-environments with a holographic convolutional neural network. proteins play a central role in biology from immune recognition to brain activity. while major advances in machine learning have improved our ability to predict protein structure from sequence, determining protein function from structure remains a major challenge. here, we introduce holographic convolutional neural network (h-cnn) for proteins, which is a physically motivated machine learning approach to model amino acid preferences in protein structures. h-cnn reflects physical interactions in a protein structure and recapitulates the functional information stored in evolutionary data. h-cnn accurately predicts the impact of mutations on protein function, including stability and binding of protein complexes. our interpretable computational model for protein structure-function maps could guide design of novel proteins with desired function."
"contrastive representation learning for 3d protein structures. learning from 3d protein structures has gained wide interest in protein modeling and structural bioinformatics. unfortunately, the number of available structures is orders of magnitude lower than the training data sizes commonly used in computer vision and machine learning. moreover, this number is reduced even further, when only annotated protein structures can be considered, making the training of existing models difficult and prone to over-fitting. to address this challenge, we introduce a new representation learning framework for 3d protein structures. our framework uses unsupervised contrastive learning to learn meaningful representations of protein structures, making use of proteins from the protein data bank. we show, how these representations can be used to solve a large variety of tasks, such as protein function prediction, protein fold classification, structural similarity prediction, and protein-ligand binding affinity prediction. moreover, we show how fine-tuned networks, pre-trained with our algorithm, lead to significantly improved task performance, achieving new state-of-the-art results in many tasks."
