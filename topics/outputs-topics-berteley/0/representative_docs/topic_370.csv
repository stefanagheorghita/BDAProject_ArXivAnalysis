"shift and polarization of excitons from quantum geometry. despite a long history, certain aspects of excitons - the bound inter-band states which form when a valence band hole and a conduction band electron pair - have remained relatively unexplored. this holds particularly true for the wavefunction of an exciton, for which few properties have been explored theoretically in various limiting cases. an intuitive language robustly characterizing the topology of bound electron-hole states is lacking, but needed in order to address the global features of the charge distribution of the excitonic state, to properly understand their transport theory, and to supplement the numerical investigation of excitons in ab-initio approaches. here, we address these gaps by developing a comprehensive framework for the quantum geometry and topology of two-dimensional exciton states in terms of the exact connections which describe the interaction-renormalized exciton bundle in a periodic lattice. based on this description, we derive two gauge-invariant quantities, which we identify as the exciton shift vector and the exciton dipole vector. using the shift vector, we elucidate the topology of exciton bands compared to the topology of the parent electronic band structure, pinpointing precisely how interactions can introduce nontrivial topology to the exciton bands beyond the topology which is contained in the single-particle bands. we further elucidate how shift and polarizations enter into the semiclassical equations of motion for the exciton center of mass coordinates."
"theory of exciton-electron scattering in atomically thin semiconductors. the realization of mixtures of excitons and charge carriers in van-der-waals materials presents a new frontier for the study of the many-body physics of strongly interacting bose-fermi mixtures. in order to derive an effective low-energy model for such systems, we develop an exact diagonalization approach based on a discrete variable representation that predicts the scattering and bound state properties of three charges in two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides. from the solution of the quantum mechanical three-body problem we thus obtain the bound state energies of excitons and trions within an effective mass model which are in excellent agreement with quantum monte carlo predictions. the diagonalization approach also gives access to excited states of the three-body system. this allows us to predict the scattering phase shifts of electrons and excitons that serve as input for a low-energy theory of interacting mixtures of excitons and charge carriers at finite density. to this end we derive an effective exciton-electron scattering potential that is directly applicable for quantum monte-carlo or diagrammatic many-body techniques. as an example, we demonstrate the approach by studying the many-body physics of exciton fermi polarons in transition-metal dichalcogenides, and we show that finite-range corrections have a substantial impact on the optical absorption spectrum. our approach can be applied to a plethora of many-body phenomena realizable in atomically thin semiconductors ranging from exciton localization to induced superconductivity."
"theory of exciton-phonon coupling. the effects of the electron-phonon interaction on optical excitations can be understood in terms of exciton-phonon coupling, and require a careful treatment in low-dimensional materials with strongly bound excitons or strong electron-hole interaction in general. through phonon absorption and emission processes, the optically accessible excitons are scattered into otherwise optically dark finite-momentum exciton states. we derive a practical expression for the phonon-induced term of the exciton self-energy (denoted as the exciton-phonon self-energy) that gives the temperature dependence of the optical transition energies and their lifetime broadening resulting from the exciton's interaction with the phonons. we illustrate this theory on a two-dimensional model, and show that our expression for the exciton-phonon self-energy differs qualitatively from previous expressions found in the literature that neglect the exciton binding or electron-hole correlations."
