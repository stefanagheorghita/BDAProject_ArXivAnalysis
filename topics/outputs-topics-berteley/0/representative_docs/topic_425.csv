"thermal noise in interferometric gravitational wave detectors due to dielectric optical coatings. we report on thermal noise from the internal friction of dielectric coatings made from alternating layers of ta2o5 and sio2 deposited on fused silica substrates. we present calculations of the thermal noise in gravitational wave interferometers due to optical coatings, when the material properties of the coating are different from those of the substrate and the mechanical loss angle in the coating is anisotropic. the loss angle in the coatings for strains parallel to the substrate surface was determined from ringdown experiments. we measured the mechanical quality factor of three fused silica samples with coatings deposited on them. the loss angle of the coating material for strains parallel to the coated surface was found to be (4.2 +- 0.3)*10^(-4) for coatings deposited on commercially polished slides and (1.0 +- 0.3)*10^{-4} for a coating deposited on a superpolished disk. using these numbers, we estimate the effect of coatings on thermal noise in the initial ligo and advanced ligo interferometers. we also find that the corresponding prediction for thermal noise in the 40 m ligo prototype at caltech is consistent with the noise data. these results are complemented by results for a different type of coating, presented in a companion paper."
"in situ substrate birefringence characterization in gravitational wave detectors using a heterodyne polarimetry method. high-quality test mass substrates play essential roles in laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors. inhomogeneous birefringence distribution in test mass substrates, however, can degrade the sensitivity of the detector by introducing the optical loss and disturbing the interferometer controls. in this paper, we present a heterodyne polarimetry method that enables in situ birefringence characterizations, hence diagnosing the gravitational wave interferometer. we experimentally demonstrate the proposed method with a tabletop setup. we also discuss its applicability to current and future gravitational wave detectors and the detectable limit."
"enhancing high frequency sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors with sloshing-sagnac interferometer. sensitivity of gravitational-wave detectors is limited in the high-frequency band by quantum shot noise and eventually limited by the optical loss in signal recycling cavity. this limit is the main obstacle on the way to detect gravitational waves from the binary neutron star mergers in the current and the future generation detectors, as it does not depend on either the arm length, or the injected squeezing level. in this paper, we come up with the sloshing sagnac interferometer topology, which can be obtained from the michelson interferometer by optically connecting the end mirrors into an additional optical cavity. this transforms the interferometer into a triply-coupled cavity system capable of beating the loss-induced high-frequency limit of the signal-recycled michelson interferometer. with advanced ligo+ comparable parameters, a sloshing-sagnac scheme can achieve 7 times better sensitivity at 2.5\,khz or 4 times better signal to noise ratio for a typical waveform of binary neutron post merge. being an evolution of michelson interferometer, the sloshing-sagnac interferometer can possibly be used as a topology for the future generation detectors and upgrade of current detectors."
