"modular forms of virtually real-arithmetic type i -- mixed mock modular forms yield vector-valued modular forms. the theory of elliptic modular forms has gained significant momentum from the discovery of relaxed yet well-behaved notions of modularity, such as mock modular forms, higher order modular forms, and iterated eichler-shimura integrals. applications beyond number theory range from combinatorics, geometry, and representation theory to string theory and conformal field theory. we unify these relaxed notions in the framework of vector-valued modular forms by introducing a new class of $\mathrm{sl}_{2}(\mathbb{z})$-representations: virtually real-arithmetic types. the key point of the paper is that virtually real-arithmetic types are in general not completely reducible. we obtain a rationality result for fourier and taylor coefficients of associated modular forms."
"generalized modular forms including the weak maass forms,the ramanujan's theta functions and the tau function. the modular forms are revisited from a geometric and an algebraic point of view leading to a geometric interpretation of the weak maass forms connecting them to the ramanujan mock theta functions and to the cusp forms generated from the langlands global program."
"locally harmonic maass forms and periods of meromorphic modular forms. we investigate a new family of locally harmonic maass forms which correspond to periods of modular forms. they transform like negative weight modular forms and are harmonic apart from jump singularities along infinite geodesics. our main result is an explicit splitting of the new locally harmonic maass forms into a harmonic part and a locally polynomial part that captures the jump singularities. as an application, we obtain finite rational formulas for suitable linear combinations of periods of meromorphic modular forms associated to positive definite binary quadratic forms."
