"graph pattern entity ranking model for knowledge graph completion. knowledge graphs have evolved rapidly in recent years and their usefulness has been demonstrated in many artificial intelligence tasks. however, knowledge graphs often have lots of missing facts. to solve this problem, many knowledge graph embedding models have been developed to populate knowledge graphs and these have shown outstanding performance. however, knowledge graph embedding models are so-called black boxes, and the user does not know how the information in a knowledge graph is processed and the models can be difficult to interpret. in this paper, we utilize graph patterns in a knowledge graph to overcome such problems. our proposed model, the {\it graph pattern entity ranking model} (grank), constructs an entity ranking system for each graph pattern and evaluates them using a ranking measure. by doing so, we can find graph patterns which are useful for predicting facts. then, we perform link prediction tasks on standard datasets to evaluate our grank method. we show that our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches such as complex and toruse for standard metrics such as hits@{\it n} and mrr. moreover, our model is easily interpretable because the output facts are described by graph patterns."
"joint embedding learning of educational knowledge graphs. as an efficient model for knowledge organization, the knowledge graph has been widely adopted in several fields, e.g., biomedicine, sociology, and education. and there is a steady trend of learning embedding representations of knowledge graphs to facilitate knowledge graph construction and downstream tasks. in general, knowledge graph embedding techniques aim to learn vectorized representations which preserve the structural information of the graph. and conventional embedding learning models rely on structural relationships among entities and relations. however, in educational knowledge graphs, structural relationships are not the focus. instead, rich literals of the graphs are more valuable. in this paper, we focus on this problem and propose a novel model for embedding learning of educational knowledge graphs. our model considers both structural and literal information and jointly learns embedding representations. three experimental graphs were constructed based on an educational knowledge graph which has been applied in real-world teaching. we conducted two experiments on the three graphs and other common benchmark graphs. the experimental results proved the effectiveness of our model and its superiority over other baselines when processing educational knowledge graphs."
"domain representation for knowledge graph embedding. embedding entities and relations into a continuous multi-dimensional vector space have become the dominant method for knowledge graph embedding in representation learning. however, most existing models ignore to represent hierarchical knowledge, such as the similarities and dissimilarities of entities in one domain. we proposed to learn a domain representations over existing knowledge graph embedding models, such that entities that have similar attributes are organized into the same domain. such hierarchical knowledge of domains can give further evidence in link prediction. experimental results show that domain embeddings give a significant improvement over the most recent state-of-art baseline knowledge graph embedding models."
