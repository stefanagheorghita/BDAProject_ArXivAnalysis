"quasinormal modes of black holes and black branes. quasinormal modes are eigenmodes of dissipative systems. perturbations of classical gravitational backgrounds involving black holes or branes naturally lead to quasinormal modes. the analysis and classification of the quasinormal spectra requires solving non-hermitian eigenvalue problems for the associated linear differential equations. within the recently developed gauge-gravity duality, these modes serve as an important tool for determining the near-equilibrium properties of strongly coupled quantum field theories, in particular their transport coefficients, such as viscosity, conductivity and diffusion constants. in astrophysics, the detection of quasinormal modes in gravitational wave experiments would allow precise measurements of the mass and spin of black holes as well as new tests of general relativity. this review is meant as an introduction to the subject, with a focus on the recent developments in the field."
"quasinormal modes of regular black holes with non linear-electrodynamical sources. we compute the spectrum of quasinormal frequencies of regular black holes obtained in the presence of non-linear electrodynamics. in particular, we perturb the black hole with a minimally coupled massive scalar field, and we study the corresponding perturbations adopting the 6th order wkb approximation. we analyze in detail the impact on the spectrum of the charge of the black hole, the quantum number of angular momentum and the overtone number. all modes are found to be stable. finally, a comparison with other charged black holes is made, and an analytical expression for the quasinormal spectrum in the eikonal limit is provided."
"scalar and electromagnetic quasinormal modes of extended black hole in f(r) gravity. in this paper we study the scalar and electromagnetic perturbations of an extended black hole in f(r) gravity. the quasinormal modes in two cases are evaluated and studied their behavior by plotting graphs in each case. to study the quasinormal mode, we use the third order wkb method. the present study shows that the absolute value of imaginary part of complex quasinormal modes increases in both cases, thus the black hole is stable against these perturbations. as the mass of the scalar field increases the imaginary part of the frequency decreases. thus damping slows down with increasing mass of the scalar field."
