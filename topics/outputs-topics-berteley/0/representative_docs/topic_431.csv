"magnetic properties and phase diagrams of mixed spin-1 and spin-1/2 ising model on a checkerboard square structure: a monte carlo study. the magnetic properties and phase diagrams of the mixed spin-1 and spin-1/2 ising model on a checkerboard square structure have been studied using the monte carlo simulations based on the metropolis update protocol. the system consists of four quartets of alternative spin configuration. the effect of the exchange interactions j and crystal field d on the magnetic properties, critical and compensation temperatures, susceptibility, and specific heat of the system have been investigated. the phase diagrams, t-j and t-d, for different values of the exchange interactions and crystal field have been examined. we found that the compensation temperature starts to evolve for j1 < 0.6 of the spin-1 assembly and for j2 > 1.6 for spin-1/2. on the other hand, the effect of ferrimagnetic coupling does not show any threshold value; in this case, the compensation temperature is constant. regarding the crystal field strength, the threshold value of d > -0.8 has been observed. we obtain the n-, q- and p-type compensation behaviors in the system. we have observed that the phase diagrams exhibit only a second-order phase transition to a paramagnetic phase; hence, the system does not show the tricritical point. the magnetic hysteresis cycles of the mixed spin-1 and spin-1/2 on a checkerboard square structure for different values of the exchange interactions, temperatures, and crystal fields have been found. finally, the system exhibits the superparamagnetism behavior for a fixed value of the temperature and crystal field."
"local evidence for collective spin excitations in the distorted kagome antiferromagnet pr$_3$bwo$_9$. we report the local probe investigation of a frustrated antiferromagnet pr$_3$bwo$_9$ with the distorted kagome lattice. absence of magnetic order or spin freezing is indicated by the spectral analysis down to 0.3 k and specific heat measurements down to 0.09 k. the knight shifts show an upturn behavior with the sample cooling down, which is further suppressed by external field. for the spin dynamics, gapped spin excitation is observed from the temperature dependence of spin-lattice relaxation rates, with the gap size proportional to the applied magnetic field intensity. comparatively, an unexpected sharp peak is observed in the nuclear spin-spin relaxation rate data at $t^*\sim 4-5$ k. these results indicate an unconventional persistent fluctuating paramagnetic ground state with antiferromagnetic collective spin excitations in the strongly frustrated spin system."
"magnetic anisotropy of the spin ice compound dy2ti2o7. we report magnetization and ac susceptibility of single crystals of the spin ice compound dy2ti2o7. saturated moments at 1.8 k along the charasteristic axes [100] and [110] agree with the expected values for an effective ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor ising pyrochlore with local <111> anisotropy, where each magnetic moment is constrained to obey the `ice-rule'. at high enough magnetic fields along the [111] axis, the saturated moment exhibits a beaking of the ice-rule; it agrees with the value expected for a three-in one-out spin configuration. assuming the realistic magnetic interaction between dy ions given by the dipolar spin ice model, we completely reproduce the results at 2 k by monte carlo calculations. however, down to at least 60 mk, we have not found any experimental evidence of the long-range magnetic ordering predicted by this model to occur at around 180 mk. instead, we confirm the spin freezing of the system below 0.5 k."
