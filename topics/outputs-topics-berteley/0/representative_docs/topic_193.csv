"defining eccentricity for gravitational wave astronomy. eccentric compact binary mergers are significant scientific targets for current and future gravitational wave observatories. to detect and analyze eccentric signals, there is an increasing effort to develop waveform models, numerical relativity simulations, and parameter estimation frameworks for eccentric binaries. unfortunately, current models and simulations use different internal parameterisations of eccentricity in the absence of a unique natural definition of eccentricity in general relativity, which can result in incompatible eccentricity measurements. in this paper, we adopt a standardized definition of eccentricity and mean anomaly based solely on waveform quantities, and make our implementation publicly available through an easy-to-use python package, gw_eccentricity. this definition is free of gauge ambiguities, has the correct newtonian limit, and can be applied as a postprocessing step when comparing eccentricity measurements from different models. this standardization puts all models and simulations on the same footing and enables direct comparisons between eccentricity estimates from gravitational wave observations and astrophysical predictions. we demonstrate the applicability of this definition and the robustness of our implementation for waveforms of different origins, including post-newtonian theory, effective one body, extreme mass ratio inspirals, and numerical relativity simulations. we focus on binaries without spin-precession in this work, but possible generalizations to spin-precessing binaries are discussed."
"hybrid model for inspiral-merger-ringdown gravitational waveforms from comparable-mass, nonspinning binary black holes. gravitational waves from comparable-mass binary-black-hole mergers are often described in terms of three stages: inspiral, merger and ringdown. post-newtonian and black-hole perturbation theories are used to model the inspiral and ringdown parts of the waveform, respectively, while the merger phase has been modeled most accurately using numerical relativity (nr). nevertheless, there have been several approaches used to model the merger phase using analytical methods. in this paper, we adapt a hybrid approximation method that applies post-newtonian and black-hole perturbation theories at the same times in different spatial regions of a binary-black-hole waveform (and which are matched at a boundary region with prescribed dynamics). prior work with the hybrid method used leading post-newtonian theory and the perturbation theory of nonrotating black holes, which led to errors during the late inspiral and disagreement with the dominant quasinormal-mode frequency extracted from nr simulations during the ringdown. to obtain a better match with nr waveforms of binary-black-hole mergers, we made several phenomenological modifications to the hybrid method. specifically, to better capture the inspiral dynamics, we use the effective-one-body method for modeling the trajectory of the boundary between the two spatial regions. the waveform is determined by evolving a regge-wheeler-zerilli-type equation for an effective black-hole perturbation theory problem with a modified poschl-teller potential. by tuning the potential to match the dominant quasinormal-mode frequency of the remnant black hole and also optimizing the boundary data on the matching region, we could match nr waveforms from nonspinning, comparable-mass binary black holes with mass ratios between one and eight, with a relative error of order $10^{-3}$."
"measuring eccentricity in binary black hole inspirals with gravitational waves. when binary black holes form in the field, it is expected that their orbits typically circularize before coalescence. in galactic nuclei and globular clusters, binary black holes can form dynamically. recent results suggest that $\approx5\%$ of mergers in globular clusters result from three-body interactions. these three-body interactions are expected to induce significant orbital eccentricity $\gtrsim 0.1$ when they enter the advanced ligo band at a gravitational-wave frequency of 10 hz. measurements of binary black hole eccentricity therefore provide a means for determining whether or not dynamic formation is the primary channel for producing binary black hole mergers. we present a framework for performing bayesian parameter estimation on gravitational-wave observations of black hole inspirals. using this framework, and employing the non-spinning, inspiral-only eccentricfd waveform approximant, we determine the minimum detectable eccentricity for an event with masses and distance similar to gw150914. at design sensitivity, we find that the current generation of advanced observatories will be sensitive to orbital eccentricities of $\gtrsim0.05$ at a gravitational-wave frequency of 10 hz, demonstrating that existing detectors can use eccentricity to distinguish between circular field binaries and globular cluster triples. we compare this result to eccentricity distributions predicted to result from three black hole binary formation channels, showing that measurements of eccentricity could be used to infer the population properties of binary black holes."
