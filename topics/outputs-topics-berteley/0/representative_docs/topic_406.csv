"securities based decision markets. decision markets are mechanisms for selecting one among a set of actions based on forecasts about their consequences. decision markets that are based on scoring rules have been proven to offer incentive compatibility analogous to properly incentivised prediction markets. however, in contrast to prediction markets, it is unclear how to implement decision markets such that forecasting is done through the trading of securities. we here propose such a securities based implementation, and show that it offers the same expected payoff as the corresponding scoring rules based decision market. the distribution of realised payoffs, however, might differ. our analysis expands the knowledge on forecasting based decision making and provides novel insights for intuitive and easy-to-use decision market implementations."
"a possibility distribution based multi-criteria decision algorithm for resilient supplier selection problems. thus far, limited research has been performed on resilient supplier selection - a problem that requires simultaneous consideration of a set of numerical and linguistic evaluation criteria, which are substantially different from traditional supplier selection problem. essentially, resilient supplier selection entails key sourcing decision for an organization to gain competitive advantage. in the presence of multiple conflicting evaluation criteria, contradicting decision makers, and imprecise decision relevant information (dri), this problem becomes even more difficult to solve with the classical optimization approaches. however, prior research focusing on mcda based supplier selection problem has been lacking in the ability to provide a seamless integration of numerical and linguistic evaluation criteria along with the consideration of multiple decision makers. to address these challenges, we present a comprehensive decision-making framework for ranking a set of suppliers from resiliency perspective. the proposed algorithm is capable of leveraging imprecise and aggregated dri obtained from crisp numerical assessments and reliability adjusted linguistic appraisals from a group of decision makers. we adapt two popular tools - single valued neutrosophic sets (svns) and interval-valued fuzzy sets (ivfs), and for the first time extend them to incorporate both crisp and linguistic evaluations in a group decision making platform to obtain aggregated svns and ivfs decision matrix. this information is then used to rank the resilient suppliers by using topsis method. we present a case study to illustrate the mechanism of the proposed algorithm."
"a multi-criteria neutrosophic group decision making metod based topsis for supplier selection. the process of multiple criteria decision making (mcdm) is of determining the best choice among all of the probable alternatives. the problem of supplier selection on which decision maker has usually vague and imprecise knowledge is a typical example of multi criteria group decision-making problem. the conventional crisp techniques has not much effective for solving mcdm problems because of imprecise or fuzziness nature of the linguistic assessments. to find the exact values for mcdm problems is both difficult and impossible in more cases in real world. so, it is more reasonable to consider the values of alternatives according to the criteria as single valued neutrosophic sets (svns). this paper deal with the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (topsis) approach and extend the topsis method to mcdm problem with single valued neutrosophic information. the value of each alternative and the weight of each criterion are characterized by single valued neutrosophic numbers. here, the importance of criteria and alternatives is identified by aggregating individual opinions of decision makers (dms) via single valued neutrosophic weighted averaging (ifwa) operator. the proposed method is, easy use, precise and practical for solving mcdm problem with single valued neutrosophic data. finally, to show the applicability of the developed method, a numerical experiment for supplier choice is given as an application of single valued neutrosophic topsis method at end of this paper."
