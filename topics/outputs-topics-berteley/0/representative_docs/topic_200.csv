"performance analysis of cognitive radio systems under qos constraints and channel uncertainty. in this paper, performance of cognitive transmission over time-selective flat fading channels is studied under quality of service (qos) constraints and channel uncertainty. cognitive secondary users (sus) are assumed to initially perform channel sensing to detect the activities of the primary users, and then attempt to estimate the channel fading coefficients through training. energy detection is employed for channel sensing, and different minimum mean-square-error (mmse) estimation methods are considered for channel estimation. in both channel sensing and estimation, erroneous decisions can be made, and hence, channel uncertainty is not completely eliminated. in this setting, performance is studied and interactions between channel sensing and estimation are investigated. following the channel sensing and estimation tasks, sus engage in data transmission. transmitter, being unaware of the channel fading coefficients, is assumed to send the data at fixed power and rate levels that depend on the channel sensing results. under these assumptions, a state-transition model is constructed by considering the reliability of the transmissions, channel sensing decisions and their correctness, and the evolution of primary user activity which is modeled as a two-state markov process. in the data transmission phase, an average power constraint on the secondary users is considered to limit the interference to the primary users, and statistical limitations on the buffer lengths are imposed to take into account the qos constraints of the secondary traffic. the maximum throughput under these statistical qos constraints is identified by finding the effective capacity of the cognitive radio channel. numerical results are provided for the power and rate policies."
"power vs. spectrum 2-d sensing in energy harvesting cognitive radio networks. energy harvester based cognitive radio is a promising solution to address the shortage of both spectrum and energy. since the spectrum access and power consumption patterns are interdependent, and the power value harvested from certain environmental sources are spatially correlated, the new power dimension could provide additional information to enhance the spectrum sensing accuracy. in this paper, the markovian behavior of the primary users is considered, based on which we adopt a hidden input markov model to specify the primary vs. secondary dynamics in the system. accordingly, we propose a 2-d spectrum and power (harvested) sensing scheme to improve the primary user detection performance, which is also capable of estimating the primary transmit power level. theoretical and simulated results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, in term of the performance gain achieved by considering the new power dimension. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to jointly consider the spectrum and power dimensions for the cognitive primary user detection problem."
"cooperative prediction-and-sensing based spectrum sharing in cognitive radio networks. this paper proposes prediction-and-sensing based spectrum sharing, a new spectrum-sharing model for cognitive radio networks, with a time structure for each resource block divided into a spectrum prediction-and-sensing phase and a data transmission phase. cooperative spectrum prediction is incorporated as a sub-phase of spectrum sensing in the first phase. we investigate a joint design of transmit beamforming at the secondary base station (bs) and sensing time. the primary design goal is to maximize the sum rate of all secondary users (sus) subject to the minimum rate requirement for all sus, the transmit power constraint at the secondary bs, and the interference power constraints at all primary users. the original problem is difficult to solve since it is highly nonconvex. we first convert the problem into a more tractable form, then arrive at a convex program based on an inner approximation framework, and finally propose a new algorithm to successively solve this convex program. we prove that the proposed algorithm iteratively improves the objective while guaranteeing convergence at least to local optima. simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm reaches a stationary point after only a few iterations with a substantial performance improvement over existing approaches."
