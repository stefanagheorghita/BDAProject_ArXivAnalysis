"toward multilingual neural machine translation with universal encoder and decoder. in this paper, we present our first attempts in building a multilingual neural machine translation framework under a unified approach. we are then able to employ attention-based nmt for many-to-many multilingual translation tasks. our approach does not require any special treatment on the network architecture and it allows us to learn minimal number of free parameters in a standard way of training. our approach has shown its effectiveness in an under-resourced translation scenario with considerable improvements up to 2.6 bleu points. in addition, the approach has achieved interesting and promising results when applied in the translation task that there is no direct parallel corpus between source and target languages."
"learning to translate in real-time with neural machine translation. translating in real-time, a.k.a. simultaneous translation, outputs translation words before the input sentence ends, which is a challenging problem for conventional machine translation methods. we propose a neural machine translation (nmt) framework for simultaneous translation in which an agent learns to make decisions on when to translate from the interaction with a pre-trained nmt environment. to trade off quality and delay, we extensively explore various targets for delay and design a method for beam-search applicable in the simultaneous mt setting. experiments against state-of-the-art baselines on two language pairs demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework both quantitatively and qualitatively."
"neural machine translation by jointly learning to align and translate. neural machine translation is a recently proposed approach to machine translation. unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. the models proposed recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of encoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. in this paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. with this new approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of english-to-french translation. furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the (soft-)alignments found by the model agree well with our intuition."
