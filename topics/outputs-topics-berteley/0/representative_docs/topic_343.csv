"do the standard expressions for the electromagnetic field-momentum need any modifications?. we investigate here the question raised in literature about the correct expression for the electromagnetic field-momentum, especially when static fields are involved. for this we examine a couple of simple but intriguing cases. first we consider a system configuration in which electromagnetic field momentum is present even though the system is static. we trace the electromagnetic momentum to be present in the form of a continuous transport of electromagnetic energy from one part of the system to another, without causing any net change in the energy of the system. in a second case we show that the electromagnetic momentum is nil irrespective of whether the charged system is stationary or in motion, even though the electromagnetic energy is present throughout. we demonstrate that the conventional formulation of electromagnetic field-momentum describes the systems consistently without any real contradictions. here we also make exposition of a curiosity where electromagnetic energy decreases when the charged system gains velocity. then we discuss the more general question that has been raised -- are the conventional formulas for energy-momentum of electromagnetic fields valid for all cases? or more specifically, in the case of so-called ""bound fields,"" do we need to change over to some modified definitions which have made their appearance even in standard text books? we show that in all cases it is only the conventional formulas which lead to results consistent with the rest of physics, including the special theory of relativity, and that any proposed modifications are thus superfluous."
"on the electrodynamics of moving permanent dipoles in external electromagnetic fields. the classical theory of electrodynamics is built upon maxwell's equations and the concepts of electromagnetic field, force, energy and momentum, which are intimately tied together by poynting's theorem and the lorentz force law. whereas maxwell's macroscopic equations relate the electric and magnetic fields to their material sources (i.e., charge, current, polarization and magnetization), poynting's theorem governs the flow of electromagnetic energy and its exchange between fields and material media, while the lorentz law regulates the back-and-forth transfer of momentum between the media and the fields. the close association of momentum with energy thus demands that the poynting theorem and the lorentz law remain consistent with each other, while, at the same time, ensuring compliance with the conservation laws of energy, linear momentum, and angular momentum. this paper shows how a consistent application of the aforementioned laws of electrodynamics to moving permanent dipoles (both electric and magnetic) brings into play the rest-mass of the dipoles. the rest mass must vary in response to external electromagnetic fields if the overall energy of the system is to be conserved. the physical basis for the inferred variations of the rest-mass appears to be an interference between the internal fields of the dipoles and the externally applied fields. we use two different formulations of the classical theory in which energy and momentum relate differently to the fields, yet we find identical behavior for the rest-mass in both formulations."
"second gradient electrodynamics: a non-singular relativistic field theory. in this paper, we give the covariant formulation of second gradient electrodynamics, which is a generalized electrodynamics of second order including derivatives of higher order. the relativistic form of the field equations, the energy-momentum tensor and the lorentz force density are presented. for an electric point charge, the generalized lienard-wiechert potentials and the corresponding electromagnetic field strength tensor are given as retarded integral expressions. explicit formulas for the electromagnetic potential vector and electromagnetic field strength tensor of a uniformly moving point charge are found without any singularity and discontinuity. in addition, a world-line integral expression for the self-force of a charged point particle is given. the relativistic equation of motion of a charged particle coupled with electromagnetic fields in second gradient electrodynamics is derived, which is an integro-differential equation with nonlocality in time. for a uniformly accelerated charge, explicit formulas of the self-force and the electromagnetic mass, being non-singular, are given. moreover, the wave propagation and the dispersion relations in the vacuum of second gradient electrodynamics are analyzed. three modes of waves were found: one non-dispersive wave as in maxwell electrodynamics, and two dispersive waves similar to the wave propagation in a collisionless plasma."
