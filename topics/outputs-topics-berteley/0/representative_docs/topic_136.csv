"temporal evolution of the covid19 pandemic reproduction number: estimations from proximal optimization to monte carlo sampling. monitoring the evolution of the covid19 pandemic constitutes a critical step in sanitary policy design. yet, the assessment of the pandemic intensity within the pandemic period remains a challenging task because of the limited quality of data made available by public health authorities (missing data, outliers and pseudoseasonalities, notably), that calls for cumbersome and ad-hoc preprocessing (denoising) prior to estimation. recently, the estimation of the reproduction number, a measure of the pandemic intensity, was formulated as an inverse problem, combining data-model fidelity and space-time regularity constraints, solved by nonsmooth convex proximal minimizations. though promising, that formulation lacks robustness against the limited quality of the covid19 data and confidence assessment. the present work aims to address both limitations: first, it discusses solutions to produce a robust assessment of the pandemic intensity by accounting for the low quality of the data directly within the inverse problem formulation. second, exploiting a bayesian interpretation of the inverse problem formulation, it devises a monte carlo sampling strategy, tailored to a nonsmooth log-concave a posteriori distribution, to produce relevant credibility intervalbased estimates for the covid19 reproduction number. clinical relevance applied to daily counts of new infections made publicly available by the health authorities for around 200 countries, the proposed procedures permit robust assessments of the time evolution of the covid19 pandemic intensity, updated automatically and on a daily basis."
"statistical mechanics study of the introduction of a vaccine against covid-19 disease. by the end of 2020, a year since the first cases of infection by the covid-19 virus have been reported, there is a light at the end of the tunnel. several pharmaceutical companies made significant progress in developing effective vaccines against the covid-19 virus that has claimed the lives of more than a million people over the world. on the other hand, there is growing evidence of re-infection by the virus, which can cause further outbreaks. in this paper, we apply statistical physics tools to examine the vaccination rate required to control the pandemic for three different vaccine efficiency scenarios. also, we study the effect of temporal restrictions/reliefs on the pandemic's outbreak, assuming that re-infection is possible. when examining the efficiency of the vaccination rate of the general population in preventing an additional outbreak of the disease, we find that a high vaccination rate (where at least 0.3% of the population is vaccinated daily, which is equivalent to ~ 1 million vaccine doses in the united states daily) is required to gain control over the spread of the virus without further restrictions. due to feasible limitations on the vaccination rate, the vaccination process should be accompanied by the prevailing restrictions until most of the population is vaccinated."
"optimal epidemic control by social distancing and vaccination of an infection structured by time since infection: the covid-19 case study. motivated by the issue of covid-19 mitigation, in this work we tackle the general problem of optimally controlling an epidemic outbreak of a communicable disease structured by time since exposure, by the aid of two types of control instruments namely, social distancing and vaccination by a vaccine at least partly effective in protecting from infection. effective vaccines are assumed to be made available only in a subsequent period of the epidemic so that - in the first period - epidemic control only relies on social distancing, as it happened for the covid-19 pandemic. by our analyses, we could prove the existence of (at least) one optimal control pair, we derived first-order necessary conditions for optimality, and proved some useful properties of such optimal solutions. a worked example provides a number of further insights on the relationships between key control and epidemic parameters."
