"expansion velocity of ejecta in tycho's supernova remnant measured by doppler broadened x-ray line emission. we show that the expansion of ejecta in tycho's supernova remnant (snr) is consistent with a spherically symmetric shell, based on suzaku measurements of the doppler broadened x-ray emission lines. all the strong k_alpha line emission show broader widths at the center than at the rim, while the centroid energies are constant across the remnant (except for ca). this is the pattern expected for doppler broadening due to expansion of the snr ejecta in a spherical shell. to determine the expansion velocities of the ejecta, we applied a model for each emission line feature having two gaussian components separately representing red- and blue-shifted gas, and inferred the doppler velocity difference between these two components directly from the fitted centroid energy difference. taking into account the effect of projecting a three-dimensional shell to the plane of the detector, we derived average spherical expansion velocities independently for the k_alpha emission of si, s, ar, and fe, and k_beta of si. we found that the expansion velocities of si, s, and ar ejecta of 4700+/-100 km/s are distinctly higher than that obtained from fe k_alpha emission, 4000+/-300 km/s, which is consistent with segregation of the fe in the inner ejecta. combining the observed ejecta velocities with the ejecta proper-motion measurements by chandra, we derived a distance to the tycho's snr of 4+/-1 kpc."
"suzaku analysis of the supernova remnant g306.3-0.9 and the gamma-ray view of its neighborhood. we present an investigation of the supernova remnant (snr) g306.3$-$0.9 using archival multi-wavelength data. the suzaku spectra are well described by two-component thermal plasma models: the soft component is in ionization equilibrium and has a temperature $\sim$0.59 kev, while the hard component has temperature $\sim$3.2 kev and ionization time-scale $\sim$$2.6\times10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$ s. we clearly detected fe k-shell line at energy of $\sim$6.5 kev from this remnant. the overabundances of si, s, ar, ca, and fe confirm that the x-ray emission has an ejecta origin. the centroid energy of the fe-k line supports that g306.3$-$0.9 is a remnant of a type ia supernova (sn) rather than a core-collapse sn. the gev gamma-ray emission from g306.3$-$0.9 and its surrounding were analyzed using about 6 years of fermi data. we report about the non-detection of g306.3$-$0.9 and the detection of a new extended gamma-ray source in the south-west of g306.3$-$0.9 with a significance of $\sim$13$\sigma$. we discuss several scenarios for these results with the help of data from other wavebands to understand the snr and its neighborhood."
"multi-frequency study of supernova remnants in the large magellanic cloud. confirmation of the supernova remnant status of dem l205. we present new x-ray and radio data of the lmc snr candidate dem l205, obtained by xmm-newton and atca, along with archival optical and infrared observations. we use data at various wavelengths to study this object and its complex neighbourhood, in particular in the context of the star formation activity, past and present, around the source. we analyse the x-ray spectrum to derive some remnant's properties, such as age and explosion energy. supernova remnant features are detected at all observed wavelengths: soft and extended x-ray emission is observed, arising from a thermal plasma with a temperature kt between 0.2 kev and 0.3 kev. optical line emission is characterised by an enhanced [sii]/halpha ratio and a shell-like morphology, correlating with the x-ray emission. the source is not or only tentatively detected at near-infrared wavelengths (< 10 microns), but there is a detection of arc-like emission at mid and far-infrared wavelengths (24 and 70 micron) that can be unambiguously associated with the remnant. we suggest that thermal emission from dust heated by stellar radiation and shock waves is the main contributor to the infrared emission. finally, an extended and faint non-thermal radio emission correlates with the remnant at other wavelengths and we find a radio spectral index between -0.7 and -0.9, within the range for snrs. the size of the remnant is ~79x64 pc and we estimate a dynamical age of about 35000 years. we definitely confirm dem l205 as a new snr. this object ranks amongst the largest remnants known in the lmc. the numerous massive stars and the recent outburst in star formation around the source strongly suggest that a core-collapse supernova is the progenitor of this remnant.
