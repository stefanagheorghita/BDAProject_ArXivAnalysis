"tests of universal three-body physics in an ultracold bose-fermi mixture. recent measurements of efimov resonances in a number of ultracold atom species have revealed an unexpected universality, in which three-body scattering properties are determined by the van der waals length of the two-body interaction potential. to investigate whether this universality extends to heteronuclear mixtures, we measure loss rate coefficients in an ultracold trapped gas of $^{40}$k and $^{87}$rb atoms. we find an efimov-like resonance in the rate of inelastic collisions between $^{40}$k$^{87}$rb feshbach molecules and $^{87}$rb atoms. however, we do not observe any efimov-related resonances in the rates of inelastic collisions between three atoms. these observations are compared to previous measurements by the lens group of efimov resonances in a $^{41}$k and $^{87}$rb mixture as well as to recent predictions."
"observation of universality in ultracold 7li three-body recombination. we report on experimental evidence of universality in ultracold 7li atoms' three-body recombination loss in the vicinity of a feshbach resonance. we observe a recombination minimum and an efimov resonance in regions of positive and negative scattering lengths, respectively, which are connected through the pole of the feshbach resonance. both observed features lie deeply within the range of validity of the universal theory and we find that the relations between their properties, i.e. widths and locations, are in an excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions."
"a feshbach resonance in collisions between ultracold ground state molecules. collisional resonances are an important tool which has been used to modify interactions in ultracold gases, for realizing novel hamiltonians in quantum simulations, for creating molecules from atomic gases and for controlling chemical reactions. so far, such resonances have been observed for atom-atom collisions, atom-molecule collisions and collisions between feshbach molecules which are very weakly bound. whether such resonances exist for ultracold ground state molecules has been debated due to the possibly high density of states and/or rapid decay of the resonant complex. here we report a very pronounced and narrow (25 mg) feshbach resonance in collisions between two ground state nali molecules. this molecular feshbach resonance has two special characteristics. first, the collisional loss rate is enhanced by more than two orders of magnitude above the background loss rate which is saturated at the $p$-wave universal value, due to strong chemical reactivity. second, the resonance is located at a magnetic field where two open channels become nearly degenerate. this implies the intermediate complex predominantly decays to the second open channel. we describe the resonant loss feature using a model with coupled modes which is analogous to a fabry-p\'erot cavity. our observations prove the existence of long-lived coherent intermediate complexes even in systems without reaction barriers and open up the possibility of coherent control of chemical reactions."
