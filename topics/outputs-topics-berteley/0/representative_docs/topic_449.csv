"circuit theory for chemical reaction networks. we lay the foundation of a circuit theory for chemical reaction networks. chemical reactions are grouped into chemical modules solely characterized by their current-concentration characteristic, as electrical devices by their current-voltage (i-v) curve in electronic circuit theory. this, combined with the chemical analog of kirchhoff's current and voltage laws, provides a powerful tool to predict reaction currents and dissipation across complex chemical networks. the theory can serve to build accurate reduced models of complex networks as well as to design networks performing desired tasks."
"log-linear reaction quotient dynamics. chemical reaction networks in living cells maintain precise control over thousands of metabolites despite operating far from equilibrium under constant perturbations. while mass action kinetics accurately describe the underlying dynamics, the resulting nonlinear differential equations are difficult to analyze and control, particularly for large networks. we propose a simplified model where reaction quotients (the ratios that measure how far reactions are from equilibrium) evolve exponentially toward their equilibrium values when viewed on a logarithmic scale. this principle leads to linear dynamics in log-space, providing several key advantages: analytical solutions exist for arbitrary network topologies, thermodynamic constraints are automatically satisfied through the relationship between reaction quotients and gibbs free energy, conservation laws decouple from reaction quotient dynamics simplifying both analysis and control design, and external energy sources couple linearly to the dynamics, unifying diverse biological regulatory mechanisms."
"equilibrium-like behavior in far-from-equilibrium chemical reaction networks. in an equilibrium chemical reaction mixture, the number of molecules present obeys a poisson distribution. we ask when the same is true of the steady state of a nonequilibrium reaction network and obtain an essentially complete answer. in particular, we show that networks with certain topological features must have a poisson distribution, whatever the reaction rates. such driven systems also obey an analog of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. our results may be relevant to biological systems and to the larger question of how equilibrium concepts might apply to nonequilibrium systems."
