"the dynamical origin of the multi-planetary system hd45364. the recently discovered planetary system hd45364 which consists of a jupiter and saturn mass planet is very likely in a 3:2 mean motion resonance. the standard scenario to form planetary commensurabilities is convergent migration of two planets embedded in a protoplanetary disc. when the planets are initially separated by a period ratio larger than two, convergent migration will most likely lead to a very stable 2:1 resonance for moderate migration rates. to avoid this fate, formation of the planets close enough to prevent this resonance may be proposed. however, such a simultaneous formation of the planets within a small annulus, seems to be very unlikely. rapid type iii migration of the outer planet crossing the 2:1 resonance is one possible way around this problem. in this paper, we investigate this idea in detail. we present an estimate for the required convergent migration rate and confirm this with n-body and hydrodynamical simulations. if the dynamical history of the planetary system had a phase of rapid inward migration that forms a resonant configuration, we predict that the orbital parameters of the two planets are always very similar and hence should show evidence of that. we use the orbital parameters from our simulation to calculate a radial velocity curve and compare it to observations. our model can explain the observational data as good as the previously reported fit. the eccentricities of both planets are considerably smaller and the libration pattern is different. within a few years, it will be possible to observe the planet-planet interaction directly and thus distinguish between these different dynamical states."
"tilted circumbinary planetary systems as efficient progenitors of free-floating planets. the dominant mechanism for generating free-floating planets has so far remained elusive. one suggested mechanism is that planets are ejected from planetary systems due to planet-planet interactions. however, instability around a single star requires a very compactly spaced planetary system. we find that around binary star systems instability can occur even with widely separated planets that are on tilted orbits relative to the binary orbit due to combined effects of planet-binary and planet-planet interactions, especially if the binary is on an eccentric orbit. we investigate the orbital stability of planetary systems with various planet masses and architectures. we find that the stability of the system depends upon the mass of the highest mass planet. the order of the planets in the system does not significantly affect stability but, generally, the most massive planet remains stable and the lower mass planets are ejected. the minimum planet mass required to trigger the instability is about that of neptune for a circular orbit binary and a super-earth of about $10$ earth masses for highly eccentric binaries. hence, we suggest that planet formation around misaligned binaries can be an efficient formation mechanism for free-floating planets. while most observed free-floating planets are giant planets, we predict that there should be more low-mass free floating planets that are as yet unobserved than higher mass planets."
"survival of terrestrial planets in the presence of giant planet migration. the presence of ``hot jupiters'', jovian mass planets with very short orbital periods orbiting nearby main sequence stars, has been proposed to be primarily due to the orbital migration of planets formed in orbits initially much further from the parent star. the migration of giant planets would have profound effects on the evolution of inner terrestrial planets in these systems, and previous analyses have assumed that no terrestrial planets survive after migration has occurred. we present numerical simulations showing that a significant fraction of terrestrial planets could survive the migration process, eventually returning to circular orbits relatively close to their original positions. a fraction of the final orbits are in the habitable zone, suggesting that planetary systems with close-in giant planets are viable targets for searches for earth-like habitable planets around other stars."
