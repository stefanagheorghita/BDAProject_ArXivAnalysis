"temperature-dependent characterization of large-area superconducting microwire array with single-photon sensitivity in the near-infrared. superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (snspds) are a leading detector technology for time-resolved single-photon counting from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared regime. the recent advancement in single-photon sensitivity in micrometer-scale superconducting wires opens up promising opportunities to develop large area snspds with applications in low background dark matter detection experiments. we present the first detailed temperature-dependent study of a 4-channel $1\times1$ mm$^{2}$ wsi superconducting microwire single photon detector (smspd) array, including the internal detection efficiency, dark count rate, and importantly the coincident dark counts across pixels. the detector shows saturated internal detection efficiency for photon wavelengths ranging from 635 nm to 1650 nm, time jitter of about 160 ps for 1060 nm photons, and a low dark count rate of about $10^{-2}$ hz. additionally, the coincidences of dark count rate across pixels are studied for the first time in detail, where we observed an excess of correlated dark counts, which has important implications for low background dark matter experiments. the results presented is the first step towards characterizing and developing smspd array systems and associated background for low background dark matter detection experiments."
"uv superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors with high efficiency, low noise, and 4 k operating temperature. for photon-counting applications at ultraviolet wavelengths, there are currently no detectors that combine high efficiency (> 50%), sub-nanosecond timing resolution, and sub-hz dark count rates. superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (snspds) have seen success over the past decade for photon-counting applications in the near-infrared, but little work has been done to optimize snspds for wavelengths below 400 nm. here, we describe the design, fabrication, and characterization of uv snspds operating at wavelengths between 250 and 370 nm. the detectors have active areas up to 56 ${\mu}$m in diameter, 70 - 80% efficiency, timing resolution down to 60 ps fwhm, blindness to visible and infrared photons, and dark count rates of ~ 0.25 counts/hr for a 56 ${\mu}$m diameter pixel. by using the amorphous superconductor mosi, these uv snspds are also able to operate at temperatures up to 4.2 k. these performance metrics make uv snspds ideal for applications in trapped-ion quantum information processing, lidar studies of the upper atmosphere, uv fluorescent-lifetime imaging microscopy, and photon-starved uv astronomy."
"on-chip detection of entangled photons by scalable integration of single-photon detectors. photonic integrated circuits (pics) have emerged as a scalable platform for complex quantum technologies using photonic and atomic systems. a central goal has been to integrate photon-resolving detectors to reduce optical losses, latency, and wiring complexity associated with off-chip detectors. superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (snspds) are particularly attractive because of high detection efficiency, sub-50-ps timing jitter, nanosecond-scale reset time, and sensitivity from the visible to the mid-infrared spectrum. however, while single snspds have been incorporated into individual waveguides, the system efficiency of multiple snspds in one photonic circuit has been limited below 0.2% due to low device yield. here we introduce a micrometer-scale flip-chip process that enables scalable integration of snspds on a range of pics. ten low-jitter detectors were integrated on one pic with 100% device yield. with an average system efficiency beyond 10% for multiple snspds on one pic, we demonstrate high-fidelity on-chip photon correlation measurements of non-classical light."
