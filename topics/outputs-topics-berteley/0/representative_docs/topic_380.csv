"introduction to noncommutative field and gauge theory. these are lecture notes for an introductory course on noncommutative field and gauge theory. we begin by reviewing quantum mechanics as the prototypical noncommutative theory, as well as the geometrical language of standard gauge theory. then, we review a specific approach to noncommutative field and gauge theory, which relies on the introduction of a derivations-based differential calculus. we focus on the cases of constant and linear noncommutativity, e.g., the moyal spacetime and the so-called $\mathbb{r}^3_\lambda$, respectively. in particular, we review the $g\varphi^4$ scalar field theory and the $u(1)$ gauge theory on such noncommutative spaces. finally, we discuss noncommutative spacetime symmetries from both the observer and particle point of view. in this context, the twist approach is reviewed and the $\lambda$-minkowski $g\varphi^4$ model is discussed."
"noncommutative gauge theory beyond the canonical case. in this thesis noncommutative gauge theory is extended beyond the canonical case, i.e. to structures where the commutator no longer is a constant. in the first part noncommutative spaces created by star-products are studied. we are able to identify differential operators that still have an undeformed leibniz rule and can therefore be gauged much in the same way as in the canonical case. by linking these derivations to frames (vielbeins) of a curved manifold, it is possible to formulate noncommutative gauge theories that admit nonconstant noncommutativity and go to gauge theory on curved spacetime in the commutative limit. we are also able to express the dependence of the noncommutative quantities on their corresponding commutative counterparts by using seiberg-witten maps. in the second part we study noncommutative gauge theory in the matrix theory approach. there, the noncommutative space is a finite dimensional matrix algebra (fuzzy space) which emerges as the ground state of a matrix action, the fluctuations around this ground state creating the gauge theory. this gauge theory is finite, goes to gauge theory on a 4-dimensional manifold in the commutative limit and can also be used to regularize the noncommutative gauge theory of the canonical case. in particular, we are able to match parts of the known instanton sector of the canonical case with the instantons of the finite theory."
"noncommutative gauge theories: model for hodge theory. the nilpotent brst, anti-brst, dual-brst and anti-dual-brst symmetry transformations are constructed in the context of noncommutative (nc) 1-form as well as 2-form gauge theories. the corresponding noether's charges for these symmetries on the moyal plane are shown to satisfy the same algebra as by the de rham cohomological operators of differential geometry. the hodge decomposition theorem on compact manifold is also studied. we show that noncommutative gauge theories are field theoretic models for hodge theory."
