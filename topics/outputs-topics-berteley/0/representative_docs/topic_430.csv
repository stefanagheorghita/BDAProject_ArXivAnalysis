"dynamical structure of magnetized dissipative accretion flow around black holes. we study the global structure of optically thin, advection dominated, magnetized accretion flow around black holes. we consider the magnetic field to be turbulent in nature and dominated by the toroidal component. with this, we obtain the complete set of accretion solutions for dissipative flows where bremsstrahlung process is regarded as the dominant cooling mechanism. we show that rotating magnetized accretion flow experiences virtual barrier around black hole due to centrifugal repulsion that can trigger the discontinuous transition of the flow variables in the form of shock waves. we examine the properties of the shock waves and find that the dynamics of the post-shock corona (psc) is controlled by the flow parameters, namely viscosity, cooling rate and strength of the magnetic field, respectively. we separate the effective region of the parameter space for standing shock and observe that shock can form for wide range of flow parameters. we obtain the critical viscosity parameter that allows global accretion solutions including shocks. we estimate the energy dissipation at the psc from where a part of the accreting matter can deflect as outflows and jets. we compare the maximum energy that could be extracted from the psc and the observed radio luminosity values for several super-massive black hole sources and the observational implications of our present analysis are discussed."
"effect of magnetic flux advection on the dynamics of shock in accretion flow around a rotating black hole. we investigate the dynamical behaviour of a magnetized, dissipative, accretion flow around a rapidly rotating black hole. we solve the magnetohydrodynamic equations and calculate the transonic accretion solutions which may contain discontinuous shock transitions. we investigate the effect of $\zeta-$ parameter (parametrizing the radial variation of the toroidal magnetic flux advection rate) on the dynamical behaviour of shocks. for a rapidly rotating black hole and for fixed injection parameters at the outer edge, we show that stationary shocks are sustained in the global magnetized accretion solutions for a wide range of $\zeta$ and accretion rate ($\dot{m}$). to investigate the observational implications, we consider dissipative shocks and estimate the maximum accessible energy from the post-shock corona (psc) for nine stellar mass black hole candidates. we compare this with the observed radio jet kinetic power reported in the literature, whenever available. we find close agreement between the estimated values from our model with those reported in the literature."
"mass outflows from dissipative shocks in hot accretion flows. we consider stationary, axisymmetric hydrodynamic accretion flows in kerr geometry. as a plausible means of efficiently separating a small population of nonthermal particles from the bulk accretion flows, we investigate the formation of standing dissipative shocks, i.e. shocks at which fraction of the energy, angular momentum and mass fluxes do not participate in the shock transition of the flow that accretes onto the compact object but are lost into collimated (jets) or uncollimated (winds) outflows. the mass loss fraction (at a shock front) is found to vary over a wide range (0 - 95%) depending on flow's angular momentum and energy. on the other hand, the associated energy loss fraction appears to be relatively low (<1%) for a flow onto a non-rotating black hole case, whereas the fraction could be an order of magnitude higher (<10%) for a flow onto a rapidly-rotating black hole. by estimating the escape velocity of the outflowing particles with a mass-accretion rate relevant for typical active galactic nuclei, we find that nearly 10% of the accreting mass could escape to form an outflow in a disk around a non-rotating black hole, while as much as 50% of the matter may contribute to outflows in a disk around a rapidly-rotating black hole. in the context of disk-jet paradigm, our model suggests that shock-driven outflows from accretion can occur in regions not too far from a central engine. our results imply that a shock front under some conditions could serve as a plausible site where (nonthermal) seed particles of the outflows (jets/winds) are efficiently decoupled from bulk accretion."
