"virus assembly on a membrane is facilitated by membrane microdomains. for many viruses assembly and budding occur simultaneously during virion formation. understanding the mechanisms underlying this process could promote biomedical efforts to block viral propagation and enable use of capsids in nanomaterials applications. to this end, we have performed molecular dynamics simulations on a coarse-grained model that describes virus assembly on a fluctuating lipid membrane. our simulations show that the membrane can promote association of adsorbed subunits through dimensional reduction, but also can introduce barriers that inhibit complete assembly. we find several mechanisms, including one not anticipated by equilibrium theories, by which membrane microdomains, such as lipid rafts, can enhance assembly by reducing these barriers. we show how this predicted mechanism can be experimentally tested. furthermore, the simulations demonstrate that assembly and budding depend crucially on the system dynamics via multiple timescales related to membrane deformation, protein diffusion, association, and adsorption onto the membrane."
"on measuring the acoustic state changes in lipid membranes using fluorescent probes. ultrasound is increasingly being used to modulate the properties of biological membranes for applications in drug delivery and neuromodulation. while various studies have investigated the mechanical aspect of the interaction such as acoustic absorption and membrane deformation, it is not clear how these effects transduce into biological functions, for example, changes in the permeability or the enzymatic activity of the membrane. a critical aspect of the activity of an enzyme is the thermal fluctuations of its solvation or hydration shell. thermal fluctuations are also known to be directly related to membrane permeability. here solvation shell changes of lipid membranes subject to an acoustic impulse were investigated using a fluorescence probe, laurdan. laurdan was embedded in multi-lamellar lipid vesicles in water, which were exposed to broadband pressure impulses of the order of 1mpa peak amplitude and 10{\mu}s pulse duration. an instrument was developed to monitor changes in the emission spectrum of the dye at two wavelengths with sub-microsecond temporal resolution. the experiments show that changes in the emission spectrum, and hence the fluctuations of the solvation shell, are related to the changes in the thermodynamic state of the membrane and correlated with the compression and rarefaction of the incident sound wave. the results suggest that acoustic fields affect the state of a lipid membrane and therefore can potentially modulate the kinetics of channels and proteins embedded in the membrane."
"cup-to-vesicle transition of a fluid membrane with spontaneous curvature. the disk-to-vesicle transition of a fluid membrane with no spontaneous curvature is well described by the competition between edge line and curvature energies. however, the transition of asymmetric membranes with spontaneous curvatures is not yet understood. in this study, the shape of the fluid membrane patch with a constant spontaneous curvature and its closing transition to a vesicle is investigated using theory and meshless membrane simulations. it is confirmed that the (meta)stable and transient membranes are well approximated by spherical caps. the membrane gaussian modulus can be estimated from the cup shape of membrane patches as well as from the transition probability, although the latter estimate gives slightly smaller negative values. furthermore, the self-assembly dynamics of membranes are presented, in which smaller vesicles are formed at higher spontaneous curvatures, higher edge line tension, and lower density."
