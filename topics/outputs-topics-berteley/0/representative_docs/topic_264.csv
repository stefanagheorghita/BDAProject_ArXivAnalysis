"infinite matroids in graphs. it has recently been shown that infinite matroids can be axiomatized in a way that is very similar to finite matroids and permits duality. this was previously thought impossible, since finitary infinite matroids must have non-finitary duals. in this paper we illustrate the new theory by exhibiting its implications for the cycle and bond matroids of infinite graphs. we also describe their algebraic cycle matroids, those whose circuits are the finite cycles and double rays, and determine their duals. finally, we give a sufficient condition for a matroid to be representable in a sense adapted to infinite matroids. which graphic matroids are representable in this sense remains an open question."
"hypergraph characterization of split matroids. we provide a combinatorial study of split matroids, a class that was motivated by the study of matroid polytopes from a tropical geometry point of view. a nice feature of split matroids is that they generalize paving matroids, while being closed under duality and taking minors. furthermore, these matroids proved to be useful in giving exact asymptotic bounds for the dimension of the dressian, and also implied new results on the rays of the tropical grassmannians. in the present paper, we introduce the notion of elementary split matroids, a subclass of split matroids that contains all connected split matroids. we give a hypergraph characterization of elementary split matroids in terms of independent sets, and show that the proposed class is closed not only under duality and taking minors but also truncation. we further show that, in contrast to split matroids, the proposed class can be characterized by a single forbidden minor. as an application, we provide a complete list of binary split matroids."
"the structure of $\{u_{2,5}, u_{3,5}\}$-fragile matroids. let $\mathcal{n}$ be a set of matroids. a matroid $m$ is strictly $\mathcal{n}$-fragile if $m$ has a member of $\mathcal{n}$ as minor and, for all $e \in e(m)$, at least one of $m\backslash e$ and $m/e$ has no minor in $\mathcal{n}$. in this paper we give a structural description of the strictly $\{u_{2,5},u_{3,5}\}$-fragile matroids that have six inequivalent representations over $\mathrm{gf}(5)$. roughly speaking, these matroids fall into two classes. the matroids without an $\{x_8, y_8, y_8^{*}\}$-minor are constructed, up to duality, from one of two matroids by gluing wheels onto specified triangles. on the other hand, those matroids with an $\{x_8, y_8, y_8^{*}\}$-minor can be constructed from a matroid in $\{x_8, y_8, y_8^{*}\}$ by repeated application of elementary operations, and are shown to have path width 3. the characterization presented here will be crucial in finding the explicit list of excluded minors for two classes of matroids: the hydra-5-representable matroids and the 2-regular matroids."
