"in-plane quasi-single-domain batio$_3$ via interfacial symmetry engineering. the control of the in-plane domain evolution in ferroelectric thin films is not only critical to understanding ferroelectric phenomena but also to enabling functional device fabrication. however, in-plane polarized ferroelectric thin films typically exhibit complicated multi-domain states, not desirable for optoelectronic device performance. here we report a strategy combining interfacial symmetry engineering and anisotropic strain to design single-domain, in-plane polarized ferroelectric batio$_3$ thin films. theoretical calculations predict the key role of the batio$_3$ / prsco$_3$ (110)$_o$ substrate interfacial environment, where anisotropic strain, monoclinic distortions, and interfacial electrostatic potential stabilize a single-variant spontaneous polarization. a combination of scanning transmission electron microscopy, piezoresponse force microscopy, ferroelectric hysteresis loop measurements, and second harmonic generation measurements directly reveals the stabilization of the in-plane quasi-single-domain polarization state. this work offers design principles for engineering in-plane domains of ferroelectric oxide thin films, which is a prerequisite for high performance optoelectronic devices."
"physics of thin-film ferroelectric oxides. this review covers the important advances in recent years in the physics of thin film ferroelectric oxides, the strongest emphasis being on those aspects particular to ferroelectrics in thin film form. we introduce the current state of development in the application of ferroelectric thin films for electronic devices and discuss the physics relevant for the performance and failure of these devices. following this we cover the enormous progress that has been made in the first principles computational approach to understanding ferroelectrics. we then discuss in detail the important role that strain plays in determining the properties of epitaxial thin ferroelectric films. finally, we look at the emerging possibilities for nanoscale ferroelectrics, with particular emphasis on ferroelectrics in non conventional nanoscale geometries."
"dielectric and electro-mechanic nonlinearities in perovskite oxide ferroelectrics, relaxors and relaxor ferroelectrics. the polarization and strain response of ferroelectric materials at fields below the macroscopic coercive field is of a paramount importance for the operation of many electronic devices. the response of real ferroelectric and related materials is in general complex and difficult to interpret. the reason for this is that many processes in a ferroelectric material contribute to its properties, often concurrently. examples include motion of ferroelectric and ferroelastic domains, presence of domains within domains, dynamics of different types of polar nano-entities, interaction of polar nano-entities (e.g., polar nanoregions in relaxors) with the strain and polarization within domains, motion of defects and rearrangement of defect clusters and their interaction with polarization and strain. one signature of these processes is nonlinearity of the strain and polarization. most ferroelectrics exhibit nonlinear response at all practical field levels meaning that the apparent material coefficients depend on the amplitude of the driving excitation. in this paper we show that an investigation of nonlinear behavior is a sensitive way to study various mechanisms operating in dielectric and piezoelectric materials. we review the basic formalism of the nonlinear description of polarization and strain, give a physical interpretation of different terms and illustrate this approach on numerous examples of relaxors, relaxor ferroelectrics, hard and soft ferroelectrics, and morphotropic phase boundary compositions. an experimental approach based on a lock-in technique that is well-suited for such studies is also discussed."
