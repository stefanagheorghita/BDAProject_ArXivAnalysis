"charmed b(b_{s}) decays involving a light tensor meson in pqcd approach. we study the $b(b_{s})\rightarrow d_{(s)}(\bar{d}_{(s)})\,t$ and $d_{(s)}^{\ast}(\bar{d}_{(s)}^{*})\,t$ decays in perturbative qcd approach, where t denotes a light tensor meson. in addition to the branching ratios, we also give predictions to the polarization fractions for the $d^{*}_{(s)}(\bar{d}_{(s)}^{*})t$ decays. for those decays with a tensor meson emitted, the factorizable emission diagrams do not contribute because of lorentz covariance considerations. in order to give the predictions to these decay channels, it is necessary to go beyond the naive factorization to calculate the nonfactorizable and annihilation diagrams."
"hadronic b decays in pqcd. i review recent progress on exclusive hadronic b meson decays in the perturbative qcd approach, with focus on puzzles in the branching ratios and the cp asymmetries of the b -> pi k and b -> pi pi modes, and polarization fractions in b -> vv modes."
"study of the pure annihilation $b_c \to a_2 a_3$ decays. in this work, we calculate the {\it cp}-averaged branching ratios and the polarization fractions of the charmless hadronic $b_c \to a_2 a_3$ decays within the framework of perturbative qcd(pqcd) approach, where $a$ is either a light $^3p_1$ or $^1p_1$ axial-vector meson. these thirty two decay modes can occur through the annihilation topology only. based on the perturbative calculations and phenomenological analysis, we find the following results: (a) the branching ratios of the considered thirty two $b_c\to a_2 a_3$ decays are in the range of $10^{-5}$ to $10^{-8}$; (b) $b_c\to a_1 b_1$, $\ov{k}_1^0 k_1^+$ and some other decays have sizable branching ratios and can be measured at the lhc experiments; (c) the branching ratios of $b_c \to a_2(^1p_1) a_3(^1p_1)$ decays are generally much larger than those of $b_c \to a_2(^3p_1) a_3(^3p_1)$ decays with a factor around (10 $\sim$ 100); (d) the branching ratios of $b_c \to \ov{k}_1^0 k_1^+$ decays are sensitive to the value of $\theta_k$, which will be tested by the running lhc and forthcoming superb experiments; (e) the large longitudinal polarization contributions govern most considered decays and play the dominant role."
