"a survey on mobile edge computing for video streaming: opportunities and challenges. 5g communication brings substantial improvements in the quality of service provided to various applications by achieving higher throughput and lower latency. however, interactive multimedia applications (e.g., ultra high definition video conferencing, 3d and multiview video streaming, crowd-sourced video streaming, cloud gaming, virtual and augmented reality) are becoming more ambitious with high volume and low latency video streams putting strict demands on the already congested networks. mobile edge computing (mec) is an emerging paradigm that extends cloud computing capabilities to the edge of the network i.e., at the base station level. to meet the latency requirements and avoid the end-to-end communication with remote cloud data centers, mec allows to store and process video content (e.g., caching, transcoding, pre-processing) at the base stations. both video on demand and live video streaming can utilize mec to improve existing services and develop novel use cases, such as video analytics, and targeted advertisements. mec is expected to reshape the future of video streaming by providing ultra-reliable and low latency streaming (e.g., in augmented reality, virtual reality, and autonomous vehicles), pervasive computing (e.g., in real-time video analytics), and blockchain-enabled architecture for secure live streaming. this paper presents a comprehensive survey of recent developments in mec-enabled video streaming bringing unprecedented improvement to enable novel use cases. a detailed review of the state-of-the-art is presented covering novel caching schemes, optimal computation offloading, cooperative caching and offloading and the use of artificial intelligence (i.e., machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning) in mec-assisted video streaming services."
"optimized computation offloading performance in virtual edge computing systems via deep reinforcement learning. to improve the quality of computation experience for mobile devices, mobile-edge computing (mec) is a promising paradigm by providing computing capabilities in close proximity within a sliced radio access network (ran), which supports both traditional communication and mec services. nevertheless, the design of computation offloading policies for a virtual mec system remains challenging. specifically, whether to execute a computation task at the mobile device or to offload it for mec server execution should adapt to the time-varying network dynamics. in this paper, we consider mec for a representative mobile user in an ultra-dense sliced ran, where multiple base stations (bss) are available to be selected for computation offloading. the problem of solving an optimal computation offloading policy is modelled as a markov decision process, where our objective is to maximize the long-term utility performance whereby an offloading decision is made based on the task queue state, the energy queue state as well as the channel qualities between mu and bss. to break the curse of high dimensionality in state space, we first propose a double deep q-network (dqn) based strategic computation offloading algorithm to learn the optimal policy without knowing a priori knowledge of network dynamics. then motivated by the additive structure of the utility function, a q-function decomposition technique is combined with the double dqn, which leads to novel learning algorithm for the solving of stochastic computation offloading. numerical experiments show that our proposed learning algorithms achieve a significant improvement in computation offloading performance compared with the baseline policies."
"efficient radio resource management for wireless cellular networks with mobile edge computing. mobile edge computing (mec) has attracted great interests as a promising approach to augment computational capabilities of mobile devices. an important issue in the mec paradigm is computation offloading. in this paper, we propose an integrated framework for computation offloading and interference management in wireless cellular networks with mobile edge computing. in this integrated framework, the mec server makes the offloading decision according to the local computation overhead estimated by all user equipments (ues) and the offloading overhead estimated by the mec server itself. then, the mec server performs the prb allocation using graph coloring. the outcomes of the offloading decision and prb allocation are then used to allocate the computation resource of the mec server to the ues. simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme with different system parameters."
