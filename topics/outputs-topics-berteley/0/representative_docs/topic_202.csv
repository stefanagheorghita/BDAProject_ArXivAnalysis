"triviality theorems for yetter-drinfel'd hopf algebras. under suitable assumptions on the base field, we prove that a commutative semisimple yetter-drinfel'd hopf algebra over a finite abelian group is trivial, i.e., is an ordinary hopf algebra, if its dimension is relatively prime to the order of the finite abelian group. furthermore, we prove that a finite-dimensional cocommutative cosemisimple yetter-drinfel'd hopf algebra contains a trivial yetter-drinfel'd hopf subalgebra of dimension greater than one, at least if the yetter-drinfel'd hopf algebra itself has dimension greater than one."
"yetter-drinfel'd hopf algebras over groups of prime order. we prove a structure theorem for yetter-drinfel'd hopf algebras over groups of prime order that are nontrivial, cocommutative, and cosemisimple: under certain assumptions on the base field, these algebras can be decomposed into a tensor product of the dual group ring of the group of prime order and an ordinary group ring of some other group. this tensor product is a crossed product as an algebra and an ordinary tensor product as a coalgebra. in particular, the dimension of such a yetter-drinfel'd hopf algebra is divisible by the prime under consideration. we also find explicit examples of such yetter-drinfel'd hopf algebras and apply the result to the classification program for semisimple hopf algebras."
"hopf-frobenius algebras and a simpler drinfeld double. the zx-calculus and related theories are based on so-called interacting frobenius algebras, where a pair of dagger-special commutative frobenius algebras jointly form a pair of hopf algebras. in this setting we introduce a generalisation of this structure, hopf-frobenius algebras, starting from a single hopf algebra which is not necessarily commutative or cocommutative. we provide a few necessary and sufficient conditions for a hopf algebra to be a hopf-frobenius algebra, and show that every hopf algebra in the category of finite dimensional vector spaces is a hopf-frobenius algebra. in addition, we show that this construction is unique up to an invertible scalar. due to this fact, hopf-frobenius algebras provide two canonical notions of duality, and give us a ""dual"" hopf algebra that is isomorphic to the usual dual hopf algebra in a compact closed category. we use this isomorphism to construct a hopf algebra isomorphic to the drinfeld double, but has a much simpler presentation."
