"shadow casted by a twisted and rotating black hole. zhang have obtained recently a twisted rotating black hole metric, which is a vacuum solution in four-dimensional einstein gravity. this black hole solution has a rotation parameter, but without the total angular moment. here, we have investigated the shadow casted by a twisted rotating black hole. our results show that the shape of the shadow of the twisted rotating black hole is a standard round disk and does not depend on the inclination angle of the observer. it means that although the twisted rotating black hole has a rotation parameter, its shadow possesses the same behaviors as the common static black hole rather than the usual kerr-like black holes. moreover, we find that the marginally circular orbit radius of photon is independent of the direction of photon around the black hole. the value of the marginally circular orbit radius of photon and the size of shadow increase monotonously with the rotation parameter."
"rotating black hole in kalb-ramond gravity: constraining parameters by comparison with eht observations of sgr a* and m87*. this article deals with the study of some properties of the static and rotating black holes in kalb-ramond gravity in four dimensional spacetime. first, we discuss the action of the corresponding theory and the static black hole metric. then we investigate the light sphere for the static black hole by using the hamiltonian formalism and the corresponding linear radius of the shadow, angular velocity and lyapunov exponent. for the rotating black hole, we discuss the horizon structure. moreover, we study the effective potential to discuss the structure of null sphere and unstable circular null orbits around the rotating black hole. the properties such as energy emission rate and distortion are calculated and analyzed by using the numerical data for the shadows calculated by appropriately chosen parametric values for two different angular locations of the observer off the equatorial plane. we also obtain the constraints on the black hole parameters by comparing the shadow sizes of the black hole in kalb-ramond gravity and the supermassive black holes m87* and sgr a*. finally, we investigate the effect of mass, energy, angular momentum and the black hole parameters on the center of mass energy of two colliding particles that are accelerated in the vicinity of the black hole."
"shadows and weak gravitational lensing by the black hole in einstein-maxwell-scalar theory. in this paper, we investigate the optical properties of a charged black hole in einstein-maxwell-scalar (ems) theory. we evaluate the shadow cast by the black hole and obtain analytical solutions for both the radius of the photon sphere and the shadow radius. we observe that the black hole parameters $\gamma$ and $\beta$ both influence the shadow of black hole. it is shown that the photon sphere and the shadow radius increase as a consequence of the presence of parameter $\gamma$. interestingly, we show that shadow radius decreases first and then remains unchanged due to the impact of parameter $\beta$. finally, we consider the weak gravitational lensing and the total magnification of lensed images around black hole. we find that the black hole charge and parameter $\beta$ both give rise to a significant effect, reducing the deflection angle. similarly, the same behavior for the total magnification is observed due to the effect of black hole charge and parameter $\beta$."
