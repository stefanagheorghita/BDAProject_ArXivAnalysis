"a bayesian ilc method for cmb b-mode posterior estimation and reconstruction of primordial gravity wave signal. the cosmic microwave background (cmb) radiation b mode polarization signal contains the unique signature of primordial metric perturbations produced during the inflation. the separation of the weak cmb b-mode signal from strong foreground contamination in observed maps is a complex task, and proposed new generation low noise satellite missions compete with the weak signal level of this gravitational background. in this article, for the first time, we employ a foreground model-independent internal linear combination (ilc) method to reconstruct the cmb b mode signal using simulated observations over large angular scales of the sky of 6 frequency bands of future generation cmb mission probe of inflation and cosmic origins (pico). we estimate the joint cmb b mode posterior density following the interleaving gibbs steps of b mode angular power spectrum and cleaned map samples using the ilc method. we extend and improve the earlier reported bayesian ilc method to analyze weak cmb b mode reconstruction by introducing noise bias corrections at two stages during the ilc weight estimation. by performing $200$ monte carlo simulations of the bayesian ilc method, we find that our method can reconstruct the cmb signals and the joint posterior density accurately over large angular scales of the sky. we estimate blackwell-rao statistics of the marginal density of cmb b mode angular power spectrum and use them to estimate the joint density of scalar to tensor ratio $r$ and a lensing power spectrum amplitude $a^{\textrm{lens}}$. using $200$ monte carlo simulations of the delensing approach, we find that our method can achieve an unbiased detection of the primordial gravitational wave signal $r$ with more than 8$\sigma$ significance for levels of $r \geqslant 0.01$."
"mitigating cosmic microwave background shadow degradation of tensor-to-scalar ratio measurements through map-based studies. it has been pointed out that the spurious cosmic microwave background (cmb) b-mode polarization signals caused by the absorption of the cmb monopole component due to the galactic interstellar matter, called the cmb shadow, degrade the accuracy of detecting the cmb b-mode polarization signals imprinted by primordial gravitational waves. we have made a realistic estimation using simulated sky maps of how the cmb shadow affects forthcoming high-precision cmb b-mode experiments for the first time. the delta-map method, an internal template method taking into account the first-order spatial variation of foregrounds' spectral parameters, is applied as a foreground removal method. we show that if the cmb shadow effects are not taken into account in the foreground removal process, future observations would lead to the false detection of the cmb b-mode polarization signals originating from primordial gravitational waves. we also show that the effect of the cmb shadow can be mitigated by our revised delta-map method to target the cmb b-mode polarization signals at the level of tensor-to-scalar ratio r=0.001."
"a foreground model independent bayesian cmb temperature and polarization signal reconstruction and cosmological parameter estimation over large angular scales. recent cmb observations have resulted in very precise observational data. a robust and reliable cmb reconstruction technique can lead to efficient estimation of the cosmological parameters. we demonstrate the performance of our methodology using simulated temperature and polarization observations using cosmic variance limited future generation prism satellite mission. we generate samples from the joint distribution by implementing the cmb inverse covariance weighted internal-linear-combination (ilc) with the gibbs sampling technique. we use the python sky model (pysm), d4f1s1 to generate the realistic foreground templates. the synchrotron emission is parametrized by a spatially varying spectral index, whereas the thermal dust emission is described as a two-component dust model. we estimate the marginalized densities of cmb signal and theoretical angular power spectrum utilizing the samples from the entire posterior distribution. the best-fit cleaned cmb map and the corresponding angular power spectrum are consistent with the cmb realization and the sky angular power spectrum, implying an efficient foreground minimized reconstruction. the likelihood function estimated by making use of the blackwell-rao estimator is used for the estimation of the cosmological parameters. our methodology can estimate the tensor to scalar ratio $r\ge 0.0075$ for the chosen foreground models and the instrumental noise levels. our current work demonstrates an analysis pipeline starting from the reliable estimation of cmb signal and its angular power spectrum to the case of cosmological parameter estimation using the foreground model independent gibbs-ilc method."
