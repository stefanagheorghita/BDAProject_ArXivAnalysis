"majorana fermions and exotic surface andreev bound states in topological superconductors: application to cuxbi2se3. the recently discovered superconductor cuxbi2se3 is a candidate for three-dimensional time- reversal-invariant topological superconductors, which are predicted to have robust surface andreev bound states hosting massless majorana fermions. in this work, we analytically and numerically find the linearly dispersing majorana fermions at k = 0, which smoothly evolve into a new branch of gapless surface andreev bound states near the fermi momentum. the latter is a new type of andreev bound states resulting from both the nontrivial band structure and the odd-parity pairing symmetry. the tunneling spectra of these surface andreev bound states agree well with a recent point-contact spectroscopy experiment[1] and yield additional predictions for low temperature tunneling and photoemission experiments."
"topological surface superconductivity in doped weyl loop materials. we study surface superconductivity involving the `drumhead' surface states of (doped) weyl loop materials. the leading weak coupling instability in the bulk is toward a chiral superconducting order, which fully gaps the fermi surface. in this state the surface also becomes superconducting, with $p+ip$ symmetry. we show that the surface sc state is ""topological"" as long as it is fully gapped, and the system traps majoarana modes wherever a vortex line enters or exits the bulk. in contrast to true 2d $p+ip$ superconductors, these majorana zero modes arise even in the ""strong pairing"" regime where the chemical potential is entirely above/below the drumhead. we also consider conventional $s$-wave pairing, and show that in this case the surface hosts a flat band of charge neutral majorana fermions, whose momentum range is given by the projection of the bulk fermi surface. weyl loop materials thus provide access to new forms of topological superconductivity."
"topological superconductivity on the surface of fe-based superconductors. as one of the simplest systems for realizing majorana fermions, topological superconductor plays an important role in both condensed matter physics and quantum computations. based on \emph{ab~initio} calculations and the analysis of an effective 8-band model with the superconducting pairing, we demonstrate that the three dimensional extended $s$-wave fe-based superconductors such as fe$_{1+\text{y}}$se$_{0.5}$te$_{0.5}$ have a metallic topologically nontrivial band structure, and exhibit a normal-topological-normal superconductivity phase transition on the ($001$) surface by tuning the bulk carrier doping level. in the topological superconductivity (tsc) phase, a majorana zero mode is trapped at the end of a magnetic vortex line. we further show that, the surface tsc phase only exists up to a certain bulk pairing gap, and there is a normal-topological phase transition driven by the temperature, which has not been discussed before. these results pave an effective way to realize the tsc and majorana fermions in a large class of superconductors."
