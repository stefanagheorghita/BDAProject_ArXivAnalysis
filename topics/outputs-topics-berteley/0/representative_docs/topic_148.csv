"monte carlo simulations of radio emission from cosmic ray air showers. as a basis for the interpretation of data gathered by lopes and other experiments, we have carried out monte carlo simulations of geosynchrotron radio emission from cosmic ray air showers. the simulations, having been verified carefully with analytical calculations, reveal a wealth of information on the characteristics of the radio signal and their dependence on specific air shower parameters. in this article, we review the spatial characteristics of the radio emission, its predicted frequency spectrum and its dependence on important air shower parameters such as the shower zenith angle, the primary particle energy and the depth of the shower maximum, which can in turn be related to the nature of the primary particle."
measurement of the fluctuations in the number of muons in extensive air showers with the pierre auger observatory. we present the first measurement of the fluctuations in the number of muons in extensive air showers produced by ultrahigh energy cosmic rays. we find that the measured fluctuations are in good agreement with predictions from air shower simulations. this observation provides new insights into the origin of the previously reported deficit of muons in air shower simulations and constrains models of hadronic interactions at ultrahigh energies. our measurement is compatible with the muon deficit originating from small deviations in the predictions from hadronic interaction models of particle production that accumulate as the showers develop.
"evidence for a mixed mass composition at the `ankle' in the cosmic-ray spectrum. we report a first measurement for ultra-high energy cosmic rays of the correlation between the depth of shower maximum and the signal in the water cherenkov stations of air-showers registered simultaneously by the fluorescence and the surface detectors of the pierre auger observatory. such a correlation measurement is a unique feature of a hybrid air-shower observatory with sensitivity to both the electromagnetic and muonic components. it allows an accurate determination of the spread of primary masses in the cosmic-ray flux. up till now, constraints on the spread of primary masses have been dominated by systematic uncertainties. the present correlation measurement is not affected by systematics in the measurement of the depth of shower maximum or the signal in the water cherenkov stations. the analysis relies on general characteristics of air showers and is thus robust also with respect to uncertainties in hadronic event generators. the observed correlation in the energy range around the `ankle' at $\lg(e/{\rm ev})=18.5-19.0$ differs significantly from expectations for pure primary cosmic-ray compositions. a light composition made up of proton and helium only is equally inconsistent with observations. the data are explained well by a mixed composition including nuclei with mass $a > 4$. scenarios such as the proton dip model, with almost pure compositions, are thus disfavoured as the sole explanation of the ultrahigh-energy cosmic-ray flux at earth."
