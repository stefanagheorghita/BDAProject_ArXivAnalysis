"classical multivariate hermite coordinate interpolation on n-dimensional grids. in this work, we study the hermite interpolation on $n$-dimensional non-equally spaced, rectilinear grids over a field $\bbbk $ of characteristic zero, given the values of the function at each point of the grid and the partial derivatives up to a maximum degree. first, we prove the uniqueness of the interpolating polynomial, and we further obtain a compact closed form that uses a single summation, irrespective of the dimensionality, which is algebraically simpler than the only alternative closed form for the $n$-dimensional classical hermite interpolation [1]. we provide the remainder of the interpolation in integral form; we derive the ideal of the interpolation and express the interpolation remainder using only polynomial divisions, in the case of interpolating a polynomial function. moreover, we prove the continuity of hermite polynomials defined on adjacent $n$-dimensional grids, thus establishing spline behavior. finally, we perform illustrative numerical examples to showcase the applicability and high accuracy of the proposed interpolant, in the simple case of few points, as well as hundreds of points on 3d-grids using a spline-like interpolation, which compares favorably to state-of-the-art spline interpolation methods."
"about one method of construction of interpolation trigonometric splines. the method of constructing spline classes in the form of trigonometric fourier series whose coefficients have a certain decreasing order are considered. in turn, this decrement determines the number of continuous derivatives of sum of this series. by grouping members of this series according with the effect of overlaying and introducing a multiplier that provides the interpolation properties of the sum of these series on even grids, we obtain classes of trigonometric interpolation splines. depending on the types of convergence factors with a certain decreasing order, different classes of such splines are obtained. the classes of trigonometric splines include classes of periodic polynomial splines of even and odd power; at the same time, there exist trigonometric splines that do not have polynomial analogues. an example of the construction of trigonometric splines is given."
"zero distribution of random polynomials. we study global distribution of zeros for a wide range of ensembles of random polynomials. two main directions are related to almost sure limits of the zero counting measures, and to quantitative results on the expected number of zeros in various sets. in the simplest case of kac polynomials, given by the linear combinations of monomials with i.i.d. random coefficients, it is well known that their zeros are asymptotically uniformly distributed near the unit circumference under mild assumptions on the coefficients. we give estimates of the expected discrepancy between the zero counting measure and the normalized arclength on the unit circle. similar results are established for polynomials with random coefficients spanned by different bases, e.g., by orthogonal polynomials. we show almost sure convergence of the zero counting measures to the corresponding equilibrium measures for associated sets in the plane, and quantify this convergence. random coefficients may be dependent and need not have identical distributions in our results."
