"counting phylogenetic networks of level 1 and 2. phylogenetic networks generalize phylogenetic trees, and have been introduced in order to describe evolution in the case of transfer of genetic material between coexisting species. there are many classes of phylogenetic networks, which can all be modeled as families of graphs with labeled leaves. in this paper, we focus on rooted and unrooted level-k networks and provide enumeration formulas (exact and asymptotic) for rooted and unrooted level-1 and level-2 phylogenetic networks with a given number of leaves. we also prove that the distribution of some parameters of these networks (such as their number of cycles) are asymptotically normally distributed. these results are obtained by first providing a recursive description (also called combinatorial specification) of our networks, and by next applying classical methods of enumerative, symbolic and analytic combinatorics."
"a qubo formulation for the tree containment problem. phylogenetic (evolutionary) trees and networks are leaf-labeled graphs that are widely used to represent the evolutionary relationships between entities such as species, languages, cancer cells, and viruses. to reconstruct and analyze phylogenetic networks, the problem of deciding whether or not a given rooted phylogenetic network embeds a given rooted phylogenetic tree is of recurring interest. this problem, formally know as tree containment, is np-complete in general and polynomial-time solvable for certain classes of phylogenetic networks. in this paper, we connect ideas from quantum computing and phylogenetics to present an efficient quadratic unconstrained binary optimization formulation for tree containment in the general setting. for an instance (n,t) of tree containment, where n is a phylogenetic network with n_n vertices and t is a phylogenetic tree with n_t vertices, the number of logical qubits that are required for our formulation is o(n_n n_t)."
"estimation of phylogenetic tree using gene sequencing data. a phylogenetic tree is an important way in bioinformatics to find the evolutionary relationship among biological species. in this research, a proposed model is described for the estimation of a phylogenetic tree for a given set of data. to estimate a phylogenetic tree there are certain necessary steps have to be considered. gene sequences are useful data resources to estimate the relationship among species at the molecular level. in this research, the approach is to create a fusion between the existing models for the estimation of phylogenetic trees and a population-based meta-heuristics approach, i.e., genetic algorithm. ncbi's entrez databases are used for the acquisition of gene sequencing data. a modular parallel approach is applied to handle this dataset efficiently. this paper illustrates a proposed model to create an independent platform for phylogenetic tree estimation. existing benchmark approaches for tree population that are used for population-based meta-heuristic search techniques to find the best possible phylogenetic tree estimation for a given set of gene sequence data."
