"tunable optical topological transitions of plasmon polaritons in wte2 van der waals films. naturally existing in-plane hyperbolic polaritons and the associated optical topological transitions, which avoid the nano-structuring to achieve hyperbolicity, can outperform their counterparts in artificial metasurfaces. such plasmon polaritons are rare, but experimentally revealed recently in wte2 van der waals thin films. different from phonon polaritons, hyperbolic plasmon polaritons originate from the interplay of free carrier drude response and interband transitions, which promise good intrinsic tunability. however, tunable in-plane hyperbolic plasmon polariton and its optical topological transition of the isofrequency contours to the elliptic topology in a natural material have not been realized. here we demonstrate the tuning of the optical topological transition through mo-doping and temperature. the optical topological transition energy is tuned over a wide range, with frequencies ranging from 429 cm-1 (23.3 microns) for pure wte2 to 270 cm-1 (37.0 microns) at the 50% mo-doping level at 10 k. moreover, the temperature-induced blueshift of the optical topological transition energy is also revealed, enabling active and reversible tuning. surprisingly, the localized surface plasmon resonance in skew ribbons shows unusual polarization dependence, accurately manifesting its topology, which renders a reliable means to track the topology with far-field techniques. our results open an avenue for reconfigurable photonic devices capable of plasmon polariton steering, such as canaling, focusing and routing, and pave a way for low-symmetry plasmonic nanophotonics based on anisotropic natural materials."
"optical excitation of atomic force microscopy cantilever for accurate spectroscopic measurements. reliable operation of frequency modulation mode atomic force microscopy (fm-afm) depends on a clean resonance of an afm cantilever. it is recognized that the spurious mechanical resonances which originate from various mechanical components in the microscope body are excited by a piezoelectric element that is intended for exciting the afm cantilever oscillation and these spurious resonance modes cause the serious undesirable signal artifacts in both frequency shift and dissipation signals. we present an experimental setup to excite only the oscillation of the afm cantilever in a fiber-optic interferometer system using optical excitation force. while the optical excitation force is provided by a separate laser light source with a different wavelength (excitation laser : {\lambda} = 1310 nm), the excitation laser light is still guided through the same single-mode optical fiber that guides the laser light (detection laser : {\lambda} = 1550 nm) used for the interferometric detection of the cantilever deflection. we present the details of the instrumentation and its performance. this setup allows us to eliminate the problems associated with the spurious mechanical resonances such as the apparent dissipation signal and the inaccuracy in the resonance frequency measurement."
"image polaritons in boron nitride for extreme polariton confinement with low losses. polaritons in two-dimensional materials provide extreme light confinement that is difficult to achieve with metal plasmonics. however, such tight confinement inevitably increases optical losses through various damping channels. here we demonstrate that hyperbolic phonon polaritons in hexagonal boron nitride can overcome this fundamental trade-off. among two observed polariton modes, featuring a symmetric and antisymmetric charge distribution, the latter exhibits lower optical losses and tighter polariton confinement. far-field excitation and detection of this high-momenta mode becomes possible with our resonator design that can boost the coupling efficiency via virtual polariton modes with image charges that we dub image polaritons. using these image polaritons, we experimentally observe a record-high effective index of up to 132 and quality factors as high as 501. further, our phenomenological theory suggests an important role of hyperbolic surface scattering in the damping process of hyperbolic phonon polaritons."
