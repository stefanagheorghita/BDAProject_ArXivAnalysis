"structural modeling of dna loops in lactose-repressor. it is well known that the structural deformations (stressed states) of dna molecule play a crucial role in its biological functions including gene expression. for instance, looping in dna (often mediated by protein binding) is a crucial step in many gene regulatory mechanisms. we use the mechanical rod model of dna molecules to simulate its structural interactions with proteins (enzymes) during gene expression. our rod model can simulate the nonlinear dynamics of loop and supercoil formation in dna on long length scales. the formulation accounts for the structural stiffness of the dna strand, its intrinsic curvature, chiral (right-handed helical) construction and its physical interactions with the surrounding medium. the simulations of protein-mediated dna looping illustrate how the mechanical properties of dna may affect the chemical kinetics of dna-protein interactions and thereby regulate gene expression."
"conductivity of dna probed by conducting-atomic force microscopy: effects of contact electrode, dna structure, surface interactions. we studied the electrical conductivity of dna molecules with conducting atomic force microscopy as a function of the chemical nature of the substrate surfaces, the nature of the electrical contact, and the number of dna molecules (from a few molecules, to ropes and large fibers containing up to ~ 106 molecules). independent of the chemical nature of the surface (hydrophobic or hydrophilic, electrically neutral or charged), we find that dna is highly resistive. from a large number of current-voltage curves measured at several distance along the dna, we estimate a conductivity of about 10-6-10-5 s.cm-1 per dna molecule. for single dna molecules, this highly resistive behavior is correlated with its flattened conformation on the surface (reduced thickness, \~0.5-1.5 nm, compared to its nominal value, ~2.4 nm). we find that intercalating an organic semiconductor buffer film between the dna and the metal electrode improves the reliability of the contact, while direct metal evaporation usually destroys the dna and prevents any current measurements. after long exposure under vacuum or dry nitrogen, the conductivity strongly decreases, leading to the conclusion that water molecules and ions in the hydration shell of the dna play a major role."
"dna calorimetric force spectroscopy at single base pair resolution. dna hybridization is a fundamental reaction with wide-ranging applications in biotechnology. the nearest-neighbor (nn) model provides the most reliable description of the energetics of duplex formation. most dna thermodynamics studies have been done in melting experiments in bulk, of limited resolution due to ensemble averaging. in contrast, single-molecule methods have reached the maturity to derive dna thermodynamics with unprecedented accuracy. we combine single-dna mechanical unzipping experiments using a temperature jump optical trap with machine learning methods and derive the temperature-dependent dna energy parameters of the nn model. in particular, we measure the previously unknown ten heat-capacity change parameters $\delta c_p$, relevant for thermodynamical predictions throughout the dna stability range. calorimetric force spectroscopy establishes a groundbreaking methodology to accurately study nucleic acids, from chemically modified dna to rna and dna/rna hybrid structures."
