"a single server queue with batch arrivals and semi-markov services. we investigate the transient and stationary queue-length distributions of a class of service systems with correlated service times. the classical $m^x/g/1$ queue with semi-markov service times is the most prominent example in this class and serves as a vehicle to display our results. the sequence of service times is governed by a modulating process $j(t)$. the state of $j(\cdot)$ at a service initiation time determines the joint distribution of the subsequent service duration and the state of $j(\cdot)$ at the next service initiation. several earlier works have imposed technical conditions, on the zeros of a matrix determinant arising in the analysis, that are required in the computation of the stationary queue length probabilities. the imposed conditions in several of these articles are difficult or impossible to verify. without such assumptions, we determine both the transient and the steady-state joint distribution of the number of customers immediately after a departure and the state of the process $j(t)$ at the start of the next service. we numerically investigate how the mean queue length is affected by variability in the number of customers that arrive during a single service time. our main observations here are that increasing variability may {\em reduce} the mean queue length, and that the markovian dependence of service times can lead to large queue lengths, even if the system is not in heavy traffic."
"a two-queue polling model with two priority levels in the first queue. in this paper we consider a single-server cyclic polling system consisting of two queues. between visits to successive queues, the server is delayed by a random switch-over time. two types of customers arrive at the first queue: high and low priority customers. for this situation the following service disciplines are considered: gated, globally gated, and exhaustive. we study the cycle time distribution, the waiting times for each customer type, the joint queue length distribution at polling epochs, and the steady-state marginal queue length distributions for each customer type."
"breaking the symmetry in queues with delayed information. giving customers queue length information about a service system has the potential to influence the decision of a customer to join a queue. thus, it is imperative for managers of queueing systems to understand how the information that they provide will affect the performance of the system. to this end, we construct and analyze a two-dimensional deterministic fluid model that incorporates customer choice behavior based on delayed queue length information. all of the previous literature assumes that all queues have identical parameters and the underlying dynamical system is symmetric. however, in this paper, we relax this symmetry assumption by allowing the arrival rates, service rates, and the choice model parameters to be different for each queue. our methodology exploits the method of multiple scales and asymptotic analysis to understand how to break the symmetry. we find that the asymmetry can have a large impact on the underlying dynamics of the queueing system."
