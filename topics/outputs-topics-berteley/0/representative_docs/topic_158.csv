"a new temperature dependent hyperonic equation of state: application to rotating neutron star models and i-q-relations. in this work we present a newly constructed equation of state (eos) --applicable to stellar core collapse and neutron star mergers--, including the entire baryon octet. our eos is compatible with the main constraints from nuclear physics and, in particular, with a maximum mass for cold beta-equilibrated neutron stars of 2 solar masses in agreement with recent observations. as an application of our new eos, we compute numerical stationary models for rapidly (rigidly) rotating hot neutron stars. we consider maximum masses of hot stars, such as proto-neutron stars or hypermassive neutron stars in the post-merger phase of binary neutron star coalescence. the universality of i-q-relations at nonzero temperature for fast rotating models, comparing a purely nuclear eos with its counterparts containing lambda-hyperons or the entire baryon octet, respectively, is discussed, too. we find that the i-q universality is broken when thermal effects become important, whatever the value of entropy gradients in our models. thus, the use of i-q relations for the analysis of proto-neutron stars or merger remnant data, including gravitational wave signals from the last stages of binary neutron star mergers, should be regarded with care."
"low mass neutron stars and the equation of state of dense matter. neutron-star radii provide useful information on the equation of state of neutron rich matter. particularly interesting is the density dependence of the equation of state (eos). for example, the softening of the eos at high density, where the pressure rises slower than anticipated, could signal a transition to an exotic phase. however, extracting the density dependence of the eos requires measuring the radii of neutron stars for a broad range of masses. a ``normal'' 1.4 solar mass neutron star has a central density of a few times nuclear-matter saturation density. in contrast, low mass (of the order of 0.5 solar masses) neutron stars have central densities near nuclear-matter saturation density so its radius provides information on the eos at low density. unfortunately, low-mass stars are rare because they may be hard to form. instead, a precision measurement of nuclear radii on atomic nuclei may contain similar information. indeed, we find a strong correlation between the neutron radius of 208pb and the radius of a 0.5 solar-mass neutron star. thus, the radius of such a neutron star can be inferred from a measurement of the the neutron radius of 208pb. comparing this value to the measured radius of a 1.4 solar-mass neutron star should provide the strongest constraint to date on the density dependence of the equation of state."
"contraction of cold neutron star due to in the presence a quark core. motivated by importance of the existence of quark matter on structure of neutron star. for this purpose, we use a suitable equation of state (eos) which include three different parts: i) a layer of hadronic matter, ii) a mixed phase of quarks and hadrons, and, iii) a strange quark matter in the core. for this system, in order to do more investigation of the eos, we evaluate energy, le chatelier's principle and stability conditions. our results show that the eos satisfies these conditions. considering this eos, we study the effect of quark matter on the structure of neutron stars such as maximum mass and the corresponding radius, average density, compactness, kretschmann scalar, schwarzschild radius, gravitational redshift and dynamical stability. also, considering the mentioned eos in this paper, we find that the maximum mass of hybrid stars is a little smaller than that of the corresponding pure neutron star. indeed the maximum mass of hybrid stars can be quite close to the pure neutron stars. our calculations about the dynamical stability show that these stars are stable against the radial adiabatic infinitesimal perturbations. in addition, our analyze indicates that neutron stars are under a contraction due to the existence of quark core."
