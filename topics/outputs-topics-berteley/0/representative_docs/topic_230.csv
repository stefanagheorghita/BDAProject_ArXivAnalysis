"numerical methods for accurate computation of the eigenvalues of hermitian matrices and the singular values of general matrices. this paper offers a review of numerical methods for computation of the eigenvalues of hermitian matrices and the singular values of general and some classes of structured matrices. the focus is on the main principles behind the methods that guarantee high accuracy even in the cases that are ill-conditioned for the conventional methods. first, it is shown that a particular structure of the errors in a finite precision implementation of an algorithm allows for a much better measure of sensitivity and that computation with high accuracy is possible despite a large classical condition number. such structured errors incurred by finite precision computation are in some algorithms e.g. entry-wise or column-wise small, which is much better than the usually considered errors that are in general small only when measured in the frobenius matrix norm. specially tailored perturbation theory for such structured perturbations of hermitian matrices guarantees much better bounds for the relative errors in the computed eigenvalues. % secondly, we review an unconventional approach to accurate computation of the singular values and eigenvalues of some notoriously ill-conditioned structured matrices, such as e.g. cauchy, vandermonde and hankel matrices. the distinctive feature of accurate algorithms is using the intrinsic parameters that define such matrices to obtain a non-orthogonal factorization, such as the \textsf{ldu} factorization, and then computing the singular values of the product of thus computed factors. the state of the art software is discussed as well."
"theoretical results for eigenvalues, singular values, and eigenvectors of (flipped) toeplitz matrices and related computational proposals. in a series of recent papers the spectral behavior of the matrix sequence $\{y_nt_n(f)\}$ is studied in the sense of the spectral distribution, where $y_n$ is the main antidiagonal (or flip matrix) and $t_n(f)$ is the toeplitz matrix generated by the function $f$, with $f$ being lebesgue integrable and with real fourier coefficients. this kind of study is also motivated by computational purposes for the solution of the related large linear systems using the (preconditioned) minres algorithm. here we complement the spectral study with more results holding both asymptotically and for a fixed dimension $n$, and with regard to eigenvalues, singular values, and eigenvectors of $t_n(f), y_nt_n(f)$ and to several relationships among them: beside fast linear solvers, a further target is the design of ad hoc procedures for the computation of the related spectra via matrix-less algorithms, with a cost being linear in the number of computed eigenvalues. we emphasize that the challenge of the case of non-monotone generating functions is considered in the current work, for which the previous matrix-less algorithms fail. numerical experiments are reported and commented, with the aim of showing in a visual way the theoretical analysis."
"mixed precision gmres-based iterative refinement with recycling. with the emergence of mixed precision capabilities in hardware, iterative refinement schemes for solving linear systems $ax=b$ have recently been revisited and reanalyzed in the context of three or more precisions. these new analyses show that under certain constraints on condition number, the lu factorization of the matrix can be computed in low precision without affecting the final accuracy. another promising technique is gmres-based iterative refinement, which, in contrast to the standard approach, use gmres preconditioned by the low-precision triangular factors to solve for the approximate solution update in each refinement step. this more accurate solution method extends the range of problems which can be solved with a given combination of precisions. however, in certain settings, gmres may require too many iterations per refinement step, making it potentially more expensive than simply recomputing the lu factors in a higher precision. krylov subspace recycling is a well-known technique for reusing information across sequential invocations of a krylov subspace method on systems with the same or a slowly changing coefficient matrix. in this work, we incorporate the idea of krylov subspace recycling into a mixed precision gmres-based iterative refinement solver. the insight is that in each refinement step, we call preconditioned gmres on a linear system with the same coefficient matrix $a$, with only the right-hand side changing. in this way, the gmres solves in subsequent refinement steps can be accelerated by recycling information obtained from the first step. we perform extensive numerical experiments on various random dense problems, toeplitz problems (prolate matrices), and problems from real applications, which confirm the benefits of the recycling approach."
