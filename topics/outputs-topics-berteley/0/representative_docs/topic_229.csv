"a class of extended hypergeometric functions and its applications. recently, there emerges different versions of beta function and hypergeometric functions containing extra parameters. gaining enlightenment from these ideas, we will first introduce a new extension of generalized hypergeometric function and then put forward some fundamental results in the paper. next, we will derive some properties of certain functions like extended gauss hypergeometric functions, extended appell's hypergeometric functions $\mathbf{f}_{1}^{(\kappa_{l})}$, $\mathbf{f}_{2}^{(\kappa_{l})}$, and extended lauricella's hypergeometric function $\mathbf{f}_{d,(\kappa_{l})}^{(r)}$,$\mathbf{f}_{a,(\kappa_{l})}^{(r)}$, including transformation formulas, finite sum representations, mellin-barnes type integral representations and recurrence relations. moreover, by using some new integral representation which will be presented in this paper, a hardy-hilbert type inequality involving extended gauss hypergeometric functions will be established."
"elliptic hypergeometric functions. this is author's habilitation thesis (dr. sci. dissertation) submitted at the beginning of september 2004. it is written in russian and is posted due to the continuing requests for the manuscript. the content: 1. introduction, 2. nonlinear chains with the discrete time and their self-similar solutions, 3. general theory of theta hypergeometric series, 4. theta hypergeometric integrals, 5. biorthogonal functions, 6. elliptic hypergeometric functions with |q|=1, 7. conclusion, 8. references. it contains an outline of a general heuristic scheme for building univariate special functions through self-similar reductions of spectral transformation chains, which allowed construction of the differential-difference q-painleve equations, as well as of the most general known set of elliptic biorthogonal functions comprising all classical orthogonal polynomials and biorthogonal rational functions. one of the key results of the thesis consists in the discovery of genuinely transcendental elliptic hypergeometric functions determined by the elliptic hypergeometric integrals. the whole theory of such integrals can be built from the univariate elliptic beta integral -- the most complicated known definite integral with exact evaluation, which generalizes the ordinary binomial theorem and its q-extension, euler's beta integral, the measure for askey-wilson polynomials, and many other previously established results on ordinary and q-hypergeometric functions."
"on an extension of extended beta and hypergeometric functions. motivated mainly by certain interesting recent extensions of the gamma, beta and hypergeometric functions, we introduce here new extensions of the beta function, hypergeometric and confluent hypergeometric functions. we systematically investigate several properties of each of these extended functions, namely their various integral representations, mellin transforms, derivatives, transformations, summation formulas and asymptotics. relevant connections of certain special cases of the main results presented here are also pointed out."
