"resonantly phase-matched josephson junction traveling wave parametric amplifier. we develop a technique to overcome phase-mismatch in josephson-junction traveling wave parametric amplifiers in order to achieve high gain over a broad bandwidth. using ""resonant phase matching,"" we design a compact superconducting device consisting of a transmission line with subwavelength resonant inclusions that simultaneously achieves a gain of 20 db, an instantaneous bandwidth of 3 ghz, and a saturation power of -98 dbm. such an amplifier is well-suited to cryogenic broadband microwave measurements such as the multiplexed readout of quantum coherent circuits based on superconducting, semiconducting, or nano-mechanical elements as well as traditional astronomical detectors."
"hybridized-mode parametric amplifier in kinetic-inductance circuits. parametric amplification is essential for quantum measurement, enabling the amplification of weak microwave signals with minimal added noise. while josephson-junction-based amplifiers have become standard in superconducting quantum circuits, their magnetic sensitivity, limited saturation power, and sub-kelvin operating requirements motivate the development of alternative nonlinear platforms. here we demonstrate a two-mode kinetic-inductance parametric amplifier based on a pair of capacitively coupled kerr-nonlinear resonators fabricated from nbtin and nbn thin films. the distributed kerr nonlinearity of these materials enables nondegenerate four-wave-mixing amplification with gains approaching 40 db, gain-bandwidth products up to 6.9 mhz, and 1-db compression powers two to three orders of magnitude higher than those of state-of-the-art josephson amplifiers. a coupled-mode theoretical model accurately captures the pump-induced modification of the hybridized modes and quantitatively reproduces the observed signal and idler responses. the nbn device exhibits a significantly larger kerr coefficient and superior gain-bandwidth performance, highlighting the advantages of high-kinetic-inductance materials. our results establish coupled kinetic-inductance resonators as a robust platform for broadband, high-power, and magnetically resilient quantum-limited amplification, offering a scalable route for advanced readout in superconducting qubits, spin ensembles, quantum dots, and other microwave-quantum technologies."
"selective single and double-mode quantum limited amplifier. a quantum-limited amplifier enables the amplification of weak signals while introducing minimal noise dictated by the principles of quantum mechanics. these amplifiers serve a broad spectrum of applications in quantum computing, including fast and accurate readout of superconducting qubits and spins, as well as various uses in quantum sensing and metrology. parametric amplification, primarily developed using josephson junctions, has evolved into the leading technology for highly effective microwave measurements within quantum circuits. despite their significant contributions, these amplifiers face fundamental limitations, such as their inability to handle high powers, sensitivity to parasitic magnetic fields, and particularly their limitation to operate only at millikelvin temperatures. to tackle these challenges, here we experimentally develop a novel quantum-limited amplifier based on superconducting kinetic inductance and present an extensive theoretical model to describe this nonlinear coupled-mode system. our device surpasses the conventional constraints associated with josephson junction amplifiers by operating at much higher temperatures up to 4.5 k. with two distinct spectral modes and tunability through bias current, this amplifier can operate selectively in both single and double-mode amplification regimes near the quantum noise limit. utilizing a nonlinear thin film exhibiting kinetic inductance, our device attains gain exceeding 50 db in a single-mode and 32 db in a double-mode configuration while adding 0.35 input-referred quanta of noise. importantly, this amplifier eliminates the need for josephson junctions, resulting in significantly higher power handling capabilities than josephson-based amplifiers. it also demonstrates resilience in the presence of magnetic fields, offers a straightforward design, and enhances reliability."
