"chaos and complexity in quantum mechanics. we propose a new diagnostic for quantum chaos. we show that time evolution of complexity for a particular type of target state can provide equivalent information about the classical lyapunov exponent and scrambling time as out-of-time-order correlators. moreover, for systems that can be switched from a regular to unstable (chaotic) regime by a tuning of the coupling constant of the interaction hamiltonian, we find that the complexity defines a new time scale. we interpret this time scale as recording when the system makes the transition from regular to chaotic behaviour."
"quantum chaos control by complex trajectories. in recent years, analysis and control of quantum chaos are increasingly important, but the lack of the concept of trajectory makes it impossible to analyze quantum chaos by the methods used in classical chaos. this research aims to connect newton's world to the quantum world by the complex mechanics so that quantum chaos can be analyzed and controlled by the complex-extended newtonian mechanics. through the bridge of complex mechanics, in this article, we model quantum motions for 2d charged anisotropic harmonic oscillator by complex-valued dynamic equations, based on which quantum chaos can be analyzed by using well-known methods used in classical chaos. with the established quantum dynamic model, we then apply the sliding-mode control method to control the chaotic quantum behavior of the considered quantum system. the simulation results show that chaotic motions can be changed into periodic motions by the proposed chaos control and meanwhile, chaos synchronization can be achieved in the presence of variations of initial conditions. several signatures of chaos are introduced here to justify the chaos of the periodicity process under the sliding-mode control law."
"experimental observation of quantum chaos in a beam of light. the manner in which unpredictable chaotic dynamics manifests itself in quantum mechanics is a key question in the field of quantum chaos. indeed, very distinct quantum features can appear due to underlying classical nonlinear dynamics. here we observe signatures of quantum nonlinear dynamics through the direct measurement of the time-evolved wigner function of the quantum-kicked harmonic oscillator, implemented in the spatial degrees of freedom of light. our setup is decoherence-free and we can continuously tune the semiclassical and chaos parameters, so as to explore the transition from regular to essentially chaotic dynamics. owing to its robustness and versatility, our scheme can be used to experimentally investigate a variety of nonlinear quantum phenomena. as an example, we couple this system to a quantum bit and experimentally investigate the decoherence produced by regular or chaotic dynamics."
