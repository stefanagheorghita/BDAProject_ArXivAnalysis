"analyzing the heterogeneous impact of remote learning on students' ability to stay on track during the pandemic. this study investigates how remote learning due to the covid pandemic impacts students' ability to keep up with the pace of instruction in a university level physics course, with a focus on the heterogeneous impact of remote learning on different demographic groups. student learning data is collected from 70 online learning modules assigned as both online homework and self-study material in both fall 2020 and spring 2020 semesters, with the first 41 modules being assigned before campus closure in spring 2020. students' ability to stay on track is measured by three data indicators: percentage of modules submitted before the due date, percentage of modules submitted early for extra credit, and percentage of modules properly engaged with. the student population is divided into two demographic groups according to each of the four demographic variables: gender, ethnicity, transfer status and first generation status. all three data indicators from both semesters are first compared between each pair of demographic groups within the same semester, and then compared within the same group between the two semesters. exam and course scores are also compared between demographics groups in fall 2020 and against scores from the fall 2019 semester. the analysis revealed that remote learning significantly reduced on-time and early submission for first-generation students, but increased the frequency of early submission for transfer students. under-represented minority students had higher percentage of engaged modules during the pandemic, while non-urm students had the same level of module engagement before and after the pandemic. these results suggest that pandemic remote learning had very different impact for students with different demographic background, and future instructional design should strive to provide more flexible options to meet the various needs for a diverse higher-ed student population."
"the evaluation case study of online course during pandemic period in mongolia. this paper describes a test and case study of self-evaluation of online courses during the pandemic time. due to the covid-19, the whole world needs to sit on lockdown in different periods. many things need to be done in all kinds of business including the education sector of countries. to sustain the education development teaching methods had to switch from traditional face-to-face teaching to online courses. the government made decisions in a short time and educational institutions had no time to prepare the materials for the online teaching. all courses of the mongolian university of pharmaceutical sciences switched to online lessons. challenges were raised before professors and tutors during online teaching. our university did not have a specific learning management system for online teaching and e-learning. therefore professors used different platforms for their online teaching such as zoom, microsoft teams for instance. moreover, different social networking platforms played an active role in communication between students and professors. the situation is very difficult for professors and students. to measure the quality of online courses and to figure out the positive and weak points of online teaching we need an evaluation of e-learning. the focus of this paper is to share the evaluation process of e-learning based on a structure-oriented evaluation model."
"the theoretical and methodical foundations of usage of information and communication technologies in teaching higher mathematics engineering students in universities of the united states. monograph is singled out stages of the theory and methods of using ict in teaching higher mathematics engineering students in the united states, theoretically grounded and developed educational models of ict using while learning higher mathematics at engineering universities in the examined stages, the main approaches to apply the us experience on the use of ict in learning higher mathematics engineering students in ukraine are revised. the practical part of the study provides guidance for teachers on the use of ict learning higher mathematics engineering students. for researchers, teachers and university students, graduate students and all those interested in contemporary theory and methods of use of ict in education."
