"feasts: the fate of gas and star formation in interacting galaxies. we use hi data from the fast extended atlas of selected targets survey (feasts) to study the interplay between gas and star formation of galaxies in interacting systems. we build control and mock hi disks and parameterize hi disorder by a series of disorder parameters, describing the piling, clumpiness and expansion of hi. we find that interacting galaxies have higher hi disorder described by almost all disorder parameters. systems with comparable stellar masses and small relative velocities tend to have stronger expansion and clumpiness of hi. at a given stellar mass, decreased hi and total neutral gas mass and suppressed star formation rate of secondary galaxies are correlated with most disorder parameters. for primary galaxies, hi and total neutral gas deficiency correlate with more hi piling at two ends of the system outside hi disks but not with the expansion or clumpiness of hi. we also find that the hi surface densities of both primary and secondary galaxies are lower within the hi disks and higher outside compared to the control galaxies. our results suggest that while all the disorder parameters quantify the interaction strength almost equally well, they have different sensitivities in tracing star formation rate and gas mass enhancements. they also imply that while gas removal likely dominates the tidal effects on secondary galaxies, primary galaxies experience more complex situation that are possibly related to gas depletion and accretion happening at different interaction stages."
"the relationship between gas content and star formation in molecule-rich spiral galaxies. we investigate the relationship between hi, h_2, and the star formation rate (sfr) using azimuthally averaged data for seven co-bright spiral galaxies. contrary to some earlier studies based on global fluxes, we find that the sfr surface density exhibits a much stronger correlation with the h_2 than with the hi, as the hi surface density saturates at a value of $\sim$10 msol pc^{-2} or even declines at large sfr surface densities. hence the good correlation between the sfr surface density and the total (hi+h_2) gas surface density is driven by the molecular component in these galaxies. we find no clear evidence for a link between the gravitational instability parameter for the gas disk (q_g) and the sfr, and suggest that q_g be considered a measure of the gas fraction. this implies that for a state of marginal gravitational stability to exist in galaxies with low gas fractions, it must be due to instability of the stellar disk. in regions where we have both hi and co measurements, the ratio of hi to h_2 surface density scales with radius r as roughly r^{1.5}, and we suggest that the balance between hi and h_2 is determined primarily by the midplane interstellar pressure. these results favor a ""law"" of star formation in quiescent disks in which the ambient pressure and metallicity control the formation of molecular clouds from hi, with star formation then occurring at a roughly constant rate per unit h_2 mass.

"the hi reservoir in central spiral galaxies and the implied star formation process. the cold interstellar medium (ism) as the raw material for star formation is critical to understanding galaxy evolution. it is generally understood that galaxies stop making stars when, in one way or another, they run out of gas. however, here we provide evidence that central spiral galaxies remain rich in atomic gas even if their star formation rate and molecular gas fraction have dropped significantly compared to ""normal"" star-forming galaxies of the same mass. since hi is sensitive to external processes, here we investigate central spiral galaxies using a combined sample from sdss, alfalfa, and xgass surveys. after proper incompleteness corrections, we find that the key hi scaling relations for central spirals show significant but regular systematic dependence on stellar mass. at any given stellar mass, the hi gas mass fraction is about constant with changing specific star formation rate (ssfr), which suggests that hi reservoir is ubiquitous in central spirals with any star formation status down to m* ~ 10^9 msun. together with the tight correlation between the molecular gas mass fraction and ssfr for galaxies across a wide range of different properties, it suggests that the decline of sfr of all central spirals in the local universe is due to the halt of h2 supply, though there is plenty of hi gas around. these hence provide critical observations of the dramatically different behavior of the cold multi-phase ism, and a key to understand the star formation process and quenching mechanism."
