"goldberger-wise variations: stabilizing brane models with a bulk scalar. braneworld scenarios with compact extra-dimensions need the volume of the extra space to be stabilized. goldberger and wise have introduced a simple mechanism, based on the presence of a bulk scalar field, able to stabilize the radius of the randall-sundrum model. here, we transpose the same mechanism to generic single-brane and two-brane models, with one extra dimension and arbitrary scalar potentials in the bulk and on the branes. the single-brane construction turns out to be always unstable, independently of the bulk and brane potentials. in the case of two branes, we derive some generic criteria ensuring the stabilization or destabilization of the system."
"dynamical stability of six-dimensional warped brane-worlds. we study a generalization of the randall-sundrum mechanism for generating the weak/planck hierarchy, which uses two rather than one warped extra dimension, and which requires no negative tension branes. a 4-brane with one exponentially large compact dimension plays the role of the planck brane. we investigate the dynamical stability with respect to graviton, graviphoton and radion modes. the radion is shown to have a tachyonic instability for certain models of the 4-brane stress-energy, while it is stable in others, and massless in a special case. if stable, its mass is in the milli-ev range, for parameters of the model which solve the hierarchy problem. the radion is shown to couple to matter with gravitational strength, so that it is potentially detectable by submillimeter-range gravity experiments. the radion mass can be increased using a bulk scalar field in the manner of goldberger and wise, but only to order mev, due to the effect of the large extra dimension. the model predicts a natural scale of 10^{13} gev on the 4-brane, making it a natural setting for inflation from the ultraviolet brane."
"effective actions of a gauss-bonnet brane world with brane curvature terms. we consider a warped brane world scenario with two branes, gauss-bonnet gravity in the bulk, and brane localised curvature terms. when matter is present on both branes, we investigate the linear equations of motion and distinguish three regimes. at very high energy and for an observer on the positive tension brane, gravity is four dimensional and coupled to the brane bending mode in a brans-dicke fashion. the coupling to matter and brane bending on the negative tension brane is exponentially suppressed. in an intermediate regime, gravity appears to be five dimensional while the brane bending mode remains four dimensional. at low energy, matter on both branes couple to gravity for an observer on the positive tension brane, with a brans-dicke description similar to the 2--brane randall-sundrum setup. we also consider the zero mode truncation at low energy and show that the moduli approximation fails to reproduce the low energy action."
