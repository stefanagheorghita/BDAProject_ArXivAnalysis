"d-branes and cosmological singularities. the motion of a test dq-brane in a dp-brane background is studied. the induced metric on the test brane is then interpreted as the cosmology of the test brane universe. one is then able to resolve the resulting cosmological singularities. in particular, for a d3-brane in a d5-brane background, one finds a 3+1 dimensional frw universe with equation of state $p = \ed$. it has been argued that this may have been the dominant form of matter at very early times."
"adding matter to poincare invariant branes. a solution to the cosmological constant problem has been proposed in which our universe is a 3-brane in a 5-dimensional spacetime. with a bulk scalar, the field equations admit a poincare invariant brane solution regardless of the value of the cosmological constant (tension) on the brane. however, the solution does not include matter in the brane. we find new exact static solutions with matter density and pressure in the brane. we study small perturbations about these solutions. none seem consistent with observational cosmology. as a byproduct we find a class of new matterless static solutions and a non-static solution which, curiously, requires the string value for the dilaton coupling."
"brane cosmology. the aim of these lectures is to give a brief introduction to brane cosmology. after introducing some basic geometrical notions, we discuss the cosmology of a brane universe with matter localized on the brane. then we introduce an intrinsic curvature scalar term in the bulk action, and analyze the cosmology of this induced gravity. finally we present the cosmology of a moving brane in the background of other branes, and as a particular example, we discuss the cosmological evolution of a test brane moving in a background of a type-0 string theory."
