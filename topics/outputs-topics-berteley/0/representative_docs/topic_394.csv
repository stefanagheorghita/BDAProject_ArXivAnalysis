"spectrotemporal shaping of attosecond x-ray pulses with a fresh-slice free-electron laser. we propose a scheme allowing coherent shaping, i.e., controlling both the amplitude and phase, of attosecond x-ray pulses at free-electron lasers. we show that by seeding an fel with a short coherent seed that overfills the amplification bandwidth, one can shape the wigner function of the pulse by controlling the undulator taper profile. the examples of controllable pulse pairs and trains, as well as isolated spectrotemporally shaped pulses with very broad bandwidths are examined in detail. existing attosecond xfels can achieve these experimental conditions in a two-stage cascade, in which the seed is generated by a short current spike in an electron bunch and shaped in an unspoiled region within the same bunch. we experimentally demonstrate the production and control of phase-stable pulse trains using this method at the linac coherent light source ii."
"metrology of time-domain soft x-ray attosecond pulses and re-evaluation of pulse durations of three recent experiments. attosecond pulses in the soft-x-ray (sxr) to water-window energy region offer the tools for creating and studying target specific localized inner-shell electrons or holes in materials, enable monitoring or controlling charge and energy flows in a dynamic system on attosecond timescales. recently, a number of laboratories have reported generation of continuum harmonics in the hundred-electron-volt to kilovolt region with few-cycle long-wavelength mid-infrared lasers. these harmonics have the bandwidth to support pulses with duration of few- to few-ten attoseconds. but harmonics generated in a gas medium have attochirps that cannot be fully compensated by materials over a broad spectral range; thus, realistically what are the typical shortest attosecond pulses that one can generate? to answer this question, it is essential that the temporal attosecond pulses be accurately characterized. by re-analyzing the soft x-ray harmonics reported in three recent experiments \cite{chang_natcom2017,thomas_oe2017,bieger_2017prx} using a newly developed broadband phase retrieval algorithm, we show that their generated attosecond pulses are all longer than about 60 as. since broadband pulses tend to have high-order chirps away from the spectral center of the pulse, the algorithm has to be able to retrieve accurately the phase over the whole bandwidth. our re-evaluated pulse durations are found to be longer than those previously reported. we also introduce the autocorrelation (ac) of the streaking spectrogram. by comparing the acs from the experiments and from the retrieved sxr pulses, the accuracy of the retrieved results can be directly visualized to ensure that correct phases have been obtained. our retrieval method is fast and accurate, and it shall provide a powerful tool for the metrology of few-ten-attosecond pulses in the future."
"synthesis of electron microbunching rotation for generating isolated attosecond soft x-ray free-electron laser pulses. attosecond x-ray pulses play a crucial role in the study of ultrafast phenomena occurring within inner and valence electrons. especially isolated attosecond pulses with high photon energy and high peak power are of great significance in single-shot imaging in the soft x-ray region, life sciences, and attosecond pump-probe experiments. in modern accelerators, laser manipulation of electrons can be used to tailor the ultrafast properties of free-electron laser (fel) pulses. in this paper, we propose a novel laser manipulation technique that makes use of two laser beams with mutual delays and tilted wavefronts to synthesize microbunching rotation on the scale of infrared laser wavelengths within the electron bunch for generating isolated attosecond soft x-ray pulses. this microbunching rotation ultimately leads to an enhanced current contrast ratio between the main peak and the surrounding satellite peaks within the bunch. by properly accounting for the longitudinal space charge fields within the fel undulator, a tapered undulator can further suppress the side peaks in the radiation pulse and enable the selection of an isolated, hundred-attosecond, gw-level soft x-ray pulse."
