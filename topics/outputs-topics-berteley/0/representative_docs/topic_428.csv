"on the delay scaling laws of cache networks. the internet is becoming more and more content-oriented, where one of main components in content-oriented internet architectures is network caching. despite a surge of extensive use of network cashing in the current and future internet architectures, analysis on the performance of general cache networks are still quite limited due to complex inter-plays among various components and thus analytical intractability. we study asymptotic delay performance of cache networks, in particular, focusing on the impact of heterogeneous content popularities and nodes' geometric `importances' in caching policies. our theoretical findings provide useful engineering implications such as when and how various factors have impact on caching performance, and we provide extensive simulation results on the real internet topology."
"selfish caching games on directed graphs. caching networks can reduce the routing costs of accessing contents by caching contents closer to users. however, cache nodes may belong to different entities and behave selfishly to maximize their own benefits, which often lead to performance degradation for the overall network. while there has been extensive literature on allocating contents to caches to maximize the social welfare, the analysis of selfish caching behaviors remains largely unexplored. in this paper, we model the selfish behaviors of cache nodes as selfish caching games on arbitrary directed graphs with heterogeneous content popularity. we study the existence of a pure strategy nash equilibrium (psne) in selfish caching games, and analyze its efficiency in terms of social welfare. we show that a psne does not always exist in arbitrary-topology caching networks. however, if the network does not have a mixed request loop, i.e., a directed loop in which each edge is traversed by at least one content request, we show that a psne always exists and can be found in polynomial time. furthermore, we can avoid mixed request loops by properly choosing request forwarding paths. we then show that the efficiency of nash equilibria, captured by the price of anarchy (poa), can be arbitrarily poor if we allow arbitrary content request patterns, and adding extra cache nodes can make the poa worse, i.e., cache paradox happens. however, when cache nodes have homogeneous request patterns, we show that the poa is bounded even allowing arbitrary topologies. we further analyze the selfish caching games for cache nodes with limited computational capabilities, and show that an approximate psne exists with bounded poa in certain cases of interest. simulation results show that increasing the cache capacity in the network improves the efficiency of nash equilibria, while adding extra cache nodes can degrade the efficiency of nash equilibria."
"caching with reserves. caching is a crucial component of many computer systems, so naturally it is a well-studied topic in algorithm design. much of traditional caching research studies cache management for a single-user or single-processor environment. in this paper, we propose two related generalizations of the classical caching problem that capture issues that arise in a multi-user or multi-processor environment. in the caching with reserves problem, a caching algorithm is required to maintain at least $k_i$ pages belonging to user $i$ in the cache at any time, for some given reserve capacities $k_i$. in the public-private caching problem, the cache of total size $k$ is partitioned into subcaches, a private cache of size $k_i$ for each user $i$ and a shared public cache usable by any user. in both of these models, as in the classical caching framework, the objective of the algorithm is to dynamically maintain the cache so as to minimize the total number of cache misses. we show that caching with reserves and public-private caching models are equivalent up to constant factors, and thus focus on the former. unlike classical caching, both of these models turn out to be np-hard even in the offline setting, where the page sequence is known in advance. for the offline setting, we design a 2-approximation algorithm, whose analysis carefully keeps track of a potential function to bound the cost. in the online setting, we first design an $o(\ln k)$-competitive fractional algorithm using the primal-dual framework, and then show how to convert it online to a randomized integral algorithm with the same guarantee."
