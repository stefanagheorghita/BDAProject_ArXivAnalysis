"$h^1$-analysis of h3n3-2\textbf{$_\sigma$}-based difference method for fractional hyperbolic equations. a novel h3n3-2$_\sigma$ interpolation approximation for the caputo fractional derivative of order $\alpha\in(1,2)$ is derived in this paper, which improves the popular l2c formula with (3-$\alpha$)-order accuracy. by an interpolation technique, the second-order accuracy of the truncation error is skillfully estimated. based on this formula, a finite difference scheme with second-order accuracy both in time and in space is constructed for the initial-boundary value problem of the time fractional hyperbolic equation. it is well known that the coefficients' properties of discrete fractional derivatives are fundamental to the numerical stability of time fractional differential models. we prove the related properties of the coefficients of the h3n3-2$_\sigma$ approximate formula. with these properties, the numerical stability and convergence of the difference scheme are derived immediately by the energy method in the sense of $h^1$-norm. considering the weak regularity of the solution to the problem at the starting time, a finite difference scheme on the graded meshes based on h3n3-2$_\sigma$ formula is also presented. the numerical simulations are performed to show the effectiveness of the derived finite difference schemes, in which the fast algorithms are employed to speed up the numerical computation."
"on an explicit finite difference method for fractional diffusion equations. a numerical method to solve the fractional diffusion equation, which could also be easily extended to many other fractional dynamics equations, is considered. these fractional equations have been proposed in order to describe anomalous transport characterized by non-markovian kinetics and the breakdown of fick's law. in this paper we combine the forward time centered space (ftcs) method, well known for the numerical integration of ordinary diffusion equations, with the grunwald-letnikov definition of the fractional derivative operator to obtain an explicit fractional ftcs scheme for solving the fractional diffusion equation. the resulting method is amenable to a stability analysis a la von neumann. we show that the analytical stability bounds are in excellent agreement with numerical tests. comparison between exact analytical solutions and numerical predictions are made."
"a finite difference method for space fractional differential equations with variable diffusivity coefficient. anomalous diffusion is a phenomenon that cannot be modeled accurately by second-order diffusion equations, but is better described by fractional diffusion models. the nonlocal nature of the fractional diffusion operators makes substantially more difficult the mathematical analysis of these models and the establishment of suitable numerical schemes. this paper proposes and analyzes the first finite difference method for solving {\em variable-coefficient} fractional differential equations, with two-sided fractional derivatives, in one-dimensional space. the proposed scheme combines first-order forward and backward euler methods for approximating the left-sided fractional derivative when the right-sided fractional derivative is approximated by two consecutive applications of the first-order backward euler method. our finite difference scheme reduces to the standard second-order central difference scheme in the absence of fractional derivatives. the existence and uniqueness of the solution for the proposed scheme are proved, and truncation errors of order $h$ are demonstrated, where $h$ denotes the maximum space step size. the numerical tests illustrate the global $o(h)$ accuracy of our scheme, except for nonsmooth cases which, as expected, have deteriorated convergence rates."
