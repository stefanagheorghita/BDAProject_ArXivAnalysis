"a generalized quantum nonlinear oscillator. we examine various generalizations, e.g. exactly solvable, quasi-exactly solvable and non-hermitian variants, of a quantum nonlinear oscillator. for all these cases, the same mass function has been used and it has also been shown that the new exactly solvable potentials possess shape invariance symmetry. the solutions are obtained in terms of classical orthogonal polynomials."
"a simple general solution of the radial schrodinger equation for spherically symmetric potentials. by using a simple procedure the general solution of the time-independent radial schrodinger equation for spherical symmetric potentials was made without making any approximation. the wave functions are always periodic. it appears two diffucilties: one of them is the solution of the equation e= u(r), where e and u(r) are the total an effective potential energies, respectively, and the other is the calculation of the integral of the square root of u(r). if analytical calculations are not possible, one must apply numerical methods. to find the energy wave function of the ground state, there is no need for the calculation of this integral, it is sufficient to find the classical turning points, that is to solve the equation e=u(r)."
"a unified approach for exactly solvable potentials in quantum mechanics using shift operators. we present a unified approach for solving and classifying exactly solvable potentials. our unified approach encompasses many well-known exactly solvable potentials. moreover, the new approach can be used to search systematically for a new class of solvable potentials."
