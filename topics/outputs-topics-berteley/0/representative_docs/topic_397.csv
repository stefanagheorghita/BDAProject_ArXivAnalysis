"density profiles of small dirac operator eigenvalues for two color qcd at nonzero chemical potential compared to matrix models. we investigate the eigenvalue spectrum of the staggered dirac matrix in two color qcd at finite chemical potential. the profiles of complex eigenvalues close to the origin are compared to a complex generalization of the chiral gaussian symplectic ensemble, confirming its predictions for weak and strong non-hermiticity. they differ from the qcd symmetry class with three colors by a level repulsion from both the real and imaginary axis."
topological properties of qcd with two dynamical fermions. we investigate the topological susceptibility of the qcd vacuum with two flavours of dynamical staggered fermions on the lattice both at zero and finite temperature. at zero temperature we study the dependence of the signal on the fermion mass and at finite temperature we analyze the behaviour across the phase transition.
eigenvalues of the qcd dirac operator at finite temperature and density. we investigate the eigenvalue spectrum of the staggered dirac matrix in two-color qcd at nonzero temperature and at baryon density when the eigenvalues become complex. the quasi-zero modes and their role for chiral symmetry breaking and the deconfinement transition are examined. the bulk of the spectrum and its relation to quantum chaos is considered. comparison with predictions from random matrix theory is presented.
