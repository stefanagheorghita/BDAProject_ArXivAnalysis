"secure relaying in non-orthogonal multiple access: trusted and untrusted scenarios. a downlink single-input single-output non-orthogonal multiple access setting is considered, in which a base station (bs) is communicating with two legitimate users in two possible scenarios of unsecure environments: existence of an external eavesdropper and communicating through an untrusted relay. for the first scenario, a number of trusted cooperative half-duplex relays is employed to assist with the bs's transmission and secure its signals from the external eavesdropper. various relaying schemes are proposed and analyzed for that matter: cooperative jamming, decode-and-forward, and amplify-and-forward. for each scheme, secure beamforming signals are devised at the relays to maximize the achievable secrecy rate regions. for the second scenario, with the untrusted relay, achievable secrecy rate regions are derived for two different relaying schemes: compress-and-forward and amplify-and-forward, under two different modes of operation. in the first mode, coined passive user mode, the users receive signals from both the bs and the untrusted relay, and combine them to decode their messages. in the second mode, coined active user mode, the users transmit a cooperative jamming signal simultaneously with the bs's transmission to further confuse the relay. focusing on half-duplex nodes, the users cannot receive the bs's signal while jamming the relay, i.e., while being active, and rely only on the signals forwarded to them by the relay. it is shown that the best relaying scheme highly depends on the system parameters, in particular distances between the nodes, and also on which part of the secrecy rate region the system is to operate at."
"cooperative jamming for secure communications in mimo relay networks. secure communications can be impeded by eavesdroppers in conventional relay systems. this paper proposes cooperative jamming strategies for two-hop relay networks where the eavesdropper can wiretap the relay channels in both hops. in these approaches, the normally inactive nodes in the relay network can be used as cooperative jamming sources to confuse the eavesdropper. linear precoding schemes are investigated for two scenarios where single or multiple data streams are transmitted via a decode-and-forward (df) relay, under the assumption that global channel state information (csi) is available. for the case of single data stream transmission, we derive closed-form jamming beamformers and the corresponding optimal power allocation. generalized singular value decomposition (gsvd)-based secure relaying schemes are proposed for the transmission of multiple data streams. the optimal power allocation is found for the gsvd relaying scheme via geometric programming. based on this result, a gsvd-based cooperative jamming scheme is proposed that shows significant improvement in terms of secrecy rate compared to the approach without jamming. furthermore, the case involving an eavesdropper with unknown csi is also investigated in this paper. simulation results show that the secrecy rate is dramatically increased when inactive nodes in the relay network participate in cooperative jamming."
"relay selection to improve secrecy in cooperative threshold decode-and-forward relaying. in this paper, relay selection is considered to enhance security of a cooperative system with multiple threshold-selection decode-and-forward (df) relays. threshold-selection df relays are the relays in which a predefined signal-to-noise ratio is set for the condition of successful decoding of the source message. we focus on the practical and general scenario where the channels suffer from independent non-identical rayleigh fading and where the direct links between the source and destination and source and eavesdropper are available. based on channel state information knowledge, three relay selection strategies, namely traditional, improved traditional, and optimal, are studied. in particular, the secrecy outage probability of all three strategies are obtained in closed-form. it is found that the diversity of secrecy outage probability of all strategies can improve with increasing the number of relays. it is also observed that the secrecy outage probability is limited by either the source to relay or relay to destination channel quality."
