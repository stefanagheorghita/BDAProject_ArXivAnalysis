"exploring neutrino physics at lhc via r-parity violating susy. r-parity violating supersymmetric models (rpv susy) are becoming increasingly more appealing than its r-parity conserving counterpart in view of the hitherto non-observation of susy signals at the lhc. in this talk, rpv scenarios where neutrino masses are naturally generated are discussed, namely rpv through bilinear terms (brpv) and the ""mu from nu"" supersymmetric standard model. the latter is characterised by a rich higgs sector that easily accommodates a 125-gev higgs boson. the phenomenology of such models at the lhc is reviewed, giving emphasis on final states with displaced objects, and relevant results obtained by lhc experiments are presented. the implications for dark matter for these theoretical proposals is also addressed."
"susy breaking constraints on modular flavor $s_3$ invariant $su(5)$ gut model. modular flavor symmetry can be used to explain the quark and lepton flavor structures. the susy partners of quarks and leptons, which share the same superpotential with the quarks and leptons, will also be constrained by the modular flavor structure and show a different flavor(mixing) pattern at the gut scale. so, in realistic modular flavor models with susy completion, constraints from the collider and dm constraints can also be used to constrain the possible values of the modulus parameter. in the first part of this work, we discuss the possibility that the $s_3$ modular symmetry can be preserved by the fixed points of $t^2/z_n$ orbifold, especially from $t^2/z_2$. to illustrate the additional constraints from collider etc on modular flavor symmetry models, we take the simplest uv susy-completion $s_3$ modular invariance su(5) gut model as an example with generalized gravity mediation susy breaking mechanism. we find that such constraints can indeed be useful to rule out a large portion of the modulus parameters. our numerical results show that the uv-completed model can account for both the sm (plus neutrino) flavor structure and the collider, dm constraints. such discussions can also be applied straightforwardly to other modular flavor symmetry models, such as $a_4$ or $s_4$ models."
"a domino theory of flavor. we argue that the fermion masses and mixings are organized in a specific pattern. the approximately equal hierarchies between successive generations, the sizes of the mixing angles, the heaviness of just the top quark, and the approximate down-lepton equality can all be accommodated by many flavor models but can appear ad hoc. we present a simple, predictive mechanism to explain these patterns. all generations are treated democratically and the flavor symmetries are broken collectively by only two allowed couplings in flavor-space, a vector and matrix, with arbitrary o(1) entries. repeated use of these flavor symmetry breaking spurions radiatively generates the yukawa couplings with a natural hierarchy. we demonstrate this idea with two models in a split supersymmetric grand unified framework, with minimal additional particle content at the unification scale. although flavor is generated at the gut scale, there are several potentially testable predictions. in our minimal model the usual prediction of exact b-tau unification is replaced by the su(5) breaking relation m_tau / m_b = 3 / 2, in better agreement with observations. other su(5) breaking effects in the fermion masses can easily arise directly from the flavor model itself. the symmetry breaking that triggers the generation of flavor necessarily gives rise to an axion, solving the strong cp problem. these theories contain long-lived particles whose decays could give striking signatures at the lhc and may solve the primordial lithium problems. these models also give novel proton decay signatures which can be probed by the next generation of experiments. measurement of the various proton decay channels directly probes the flavor symmetry breaking couplings. in this scenario the higgs mass is predicted to lie in a range near 150 gev."
