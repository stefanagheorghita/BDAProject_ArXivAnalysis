"direct multipath-based slam. in future wireless networks, the availability of information on the position of mobile agents and the propagation environment can enable new services and increase the throughput and robustness of communications. multipath-based simultaneous localization and mapping (slam) aims at estimating the position of agents and reflecting features in the environment by exploiting the relationship between the local geometry and multipath components (mpcs) in received radio signals. existing multipath-based slam methods preprocess received radio signals using a channel estimator. the channel estimator lowers the data rate by extracting a set of dispersion parameters for each mpc. these parameters are then used as measurements for slam. bayesian estimation for multipath-based slam is facilitated by the lower data rate. however, due to finite resolution capabilities limited by signal bandwidth, channel estimation is prone to errors and mpc parameters may be extracted incorrectly and lead to a reduced slam performance. we propose a multipath-based slam approach that directly uses received radio signals as inputs. a new statistical model that can effectively be represented by a factor graph is introduced. the factor graph is the starting point for the development of an efficient belief propagation (bp) method for multipath-based slam that avoids data preprocessing by a channel estimator. numerical results based on synthetic and real data in challenging single-input, single-output (siso) scenarios demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional methods in terms of localization and mapping accuracy."
"deep learning for rf signal classification in unknown and dynamic spectrum environments. dynamic spectrum access (dsa) benefits from detection and classification of interference sources including in-network users, out-network users, and jammers that may all coexist in a wireless network. we present a deep learning based signal (modulation) classification solution in a realistic wireless network setting, where 1) signal types may change over time; 2) some signal types may be unknown for which there is no training data; 3) signals may be spoofed such as the smart jammers replaying other signal types; and 4) different signal types may be superimposed due to the interference from concurrent transmissions. for case 1, we apply continual learning and train a convolutional neural network (cnn) using an elastic weight consolidation (ewc) based loss. for case 2, we detect unknown signals via outlier detection applied to the outputs of convolutional layers using minimum covariance determinant (mcd) and k-means clustering methods. for case 3, we extend the cnn structure to capture phase shifts due to radio hardware effects to identify the spoofing signal sources. for case 4, we apply blind source separation using independent component analysis (ica) to separate interfering signals. we utilize the signal classification results in a distributed scheduling protocol, where in-network (secondary) users employ signal classification scores to make channel access decisions and share the spectrum with each other while avoiding interference with out-network (primary) users and jammers. compared with benchmark tdma-based schemes, we show that distributed scheduling constructed upon signal classification results provides major improvements to in-network user throughput and out-network user success ratio."
"pinn and gnn-based rf map construction for wireless communication systems. radio frequency (rf) map is a promising technique for capturing the characteristics of multipath signal propagation, offering critical support for channel modeling, coverage analysis, and beamforming in wireless communication networks. this paper proposes a novel rf map construction method based on a combination of physics-informed neural network (pinn) and graph neural network (gnn). the pinn incorporates physical constraints derived from electromagnetic propagation laws to guide the learning process, while the gnn models spatial correlations among receiver locations. by parameterizing multipath signals into received power, delay, and angle of arrival (aoa), and integrating both physical priors and spatial dependencies, the proposed method achieves accurate prediction of multipath parameters. experimental results demonstrate that the method enables high-precision rf map construction under sparse sampling conditions and delivers robust performance in both indoor and complex outdoor environments, outperforming baseline methods in terms of generalization and accuracy."
