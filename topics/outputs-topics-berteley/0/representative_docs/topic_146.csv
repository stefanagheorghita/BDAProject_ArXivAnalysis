"on the heterogeneous distributions in paper citations. academic papers have been the protagonists in disseminating expertise. naturally, paper citation pattern analysis is an efficient and essential way of investigating the knowledge structure of science and technology. for decades, it has been observed that citation of scientific literature follows a heterogeneous and heavy-tailed distribution, and many of them suggest a power-law distribution, log-normal distribution, and related distributions. however, many studies are limited to small-scale approaches; therefore, it is hard to generalize. to overcome this problem, we investigate 21 years of citation evolution through a systematic analysis of the entire citation history of 42,423,644 scientific literatures published from 1996 to 2016 and contained in scopus. we tested six candidate distributions for the scientific literature in three distinct levels of scimago journal & country rank (sjr) classification scheme. first, we observe that the raw number of annual citation acquisitions tends to follow the log-normal distribution for all disciplines, except for the first year of the publication. we also find significant disparity between the yearly acquired citation number among the journals, which suggests that it is essential to remove the citation surplus inherited from the prestige of the journals. our simple method for separating the citation preference of an individual article from the inherited citation of the journals reveals an unexpected regularity in the normalized annual acquisitions of citations across the entire field of science. specifically, the normalized annual citation acquisitions have power-law probability distributions with an exponential cut-off of the exponents around 2.3, regardless of its publication and citation year. our results imply that journal reputation has a substantial long-term impact on the citation."
"a multi-dimensional framework for characterizing the citation impact of scientific publications. the citation impact of a scientific publication is usually seen as a one-dimensional concept. we introduce a multi-dimensional framework for characterizing the citation impact of a publication. in addition to the level of citation impact, quantified by the number of citations received by a publication, we also conceptualize and operationalize the depth and breadth and the dependence and independence of the citation impact of a publication. the proposed framework distinguishes between publications that have a deep citation impact, typically in a relatively narrow research area, and publications that have a broad citation impact, probably covering a wider area of research. it also makes a distinction between publications that are strongly dependent on earlier work and publications that make a more independent scientific contribution. we use our multi-dimensional citation impact framework to report basic descriptive statistics on the citation impact of highly cited publications in all scientific disciplines. in addition, we present a detailed case study focusing on the field of scientometrics. the proposed citation impact framework provides a more in-depth understanding of the citation impact of a publication than a traditional one-dimensional perspective."
"an approach to the author citation potential: measures of scientific performance which are invariant across scientific fields. the citation potential is a measure of the probability of being cited. obviously, it is different among fields of science, social science, and humanities because of systematic differences in publication and citation behaviour across disciplines. in the past, the citation potential was studied at journal level considering the average number of references in established groups of journals (for example, the crown indicator is based on the journal subject categories in the web of science database). in this paper, some characterizations of the author's scientific research through three different research dimensions are proposed: production (journal papers), impact (journal citations), and reference (bibliographical sources). then, we propose different measures of the citation potential for authors based on a proportion of these dimensions. an empirical application, in a set of 120 randomly selected highly productive authors from the csic research centre (spain) in four subject areas, shows that the ratio between production and impact dimensions is a normalized measure of the citation potential at the level of individual authors. moreover, this ratio reduces the between-group variance in relation to the within-group variance in a higher proportion than the rest of the indicators analysed. furthermore, it is consistent with the type of journal impact indicator used. a possible application of this result is in the selection and promotion process within interdisciplinary institutions, since it allows comparisons of authors based on their particular scientific research."
