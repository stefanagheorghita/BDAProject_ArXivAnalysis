"a szeg\""o limit theorem for a class of toeplitz operators on the bergman space of the unit ball with singular symbols. we obtain a szeg\""o limit theorem for a family of toeplitz operators defined on the weighted bergman space of the unit ball $\mathbb{b}_{n}$. the symbols of these operators are supported on some isotropic or co-isotropic submanifold $\gamma \subseteq \mathbb{b}_{n}$ and can be seen, in general, as measures that are singular with respect to the lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{c}^{n}$. the given theorem allows to describe the asymptotic behavior of these operators as the parameter of the weighted bergman space tends to infinity."
"bounded toeplitz products on the hardy space. a toeplitz operator on the hardy space of the unit circle is bounded if and only if its symbol is bounded. for two toeplitz operators, there are no known function-theoretic conditions for their symbols, which are equivalent to the product of the toeplitz operators being bounded. in this paper, we provide a solution to this problem, by showing under certain assumptions that the product of two toeplitz operators is bounded if and only if the product of their symbols is bounded."
"toeplitz operators on the weighted harmonic bergman spaces. in this paper, we study toeplitz operators on the weighted harmonic bergman spaces with nonnegative symbols, the weights we choose here are muckenhoupt a_2 weights. results obtained include characterizations of bounded toeplitz operators, compact toeplitz operators, invertible toeplitz operators and toeplitz operators in the schatten classes."
