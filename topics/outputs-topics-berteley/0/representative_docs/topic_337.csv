"structure guided manifolds for discovery of disease characteristics. in medical image analysis, the subtle visual characteristics of many diseases are challenging to discern, particularly due to the lack of paired data. for example, in mild alzheimer's disease (ad), brain tissue atrophy can be difficult to observe from pure imaging data, especially without paired ad and cognitively normal ( cn ) data for comparison. this work presents disease discovery gan ( didigan), a weakly-supervised style-based framework for discovering and visualising subtle disease features. didigan learns a disease manifold of ad and cn visual characteristics, and the style codes sampled from this manifold are imposed onto an anatomical structural ""blueprint"" to synthesise paired ad and cn magnetic resonance images (mris). to suppress non-disease-related variations between the generated ad and cn pairs, didigan leverages a structural constraint with cycle consistency and anti-aliasing to enforce anatomical correspondence. when tested on the alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative ( adni) dataset, didigan showed key ad characteristics (reduced hippocampal volume, ventricular enlargement, and atrophy of cortical structures) through synthesising paired ad and cn scans. the qualitative results were backed up by automated brain volume analysis, where systematic pair-wise reductions in brain tissue structures were also measured"
"axial: attention-based explainability for interpretable alzheimer's localized diagnosis using 2d cnns on 3d mri brain scans. this study presents an innovative method for alzheimer's disease diagnosis using 3d mri designed to enhance the explainability of model decisions. our approach adopts a soft attention mechanism, enabling 2d cnns to extract volumetric representations. at the same time, the importance of each slice in decision-making is learned, allowing the generation of a voxel-level attention map to produce an explainable mri. to test our method and ensure the reproducibility of our results, we chose a standardized collection of mri data from the alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (adni). on this dataset, our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in (i) distinguishing ad from cognitive normal (cn) with an accuracy of 0.856 and matthew's correlation coefficient (mcc) of 0.712, representing improvements of 2.4% and 5.3% respectively over the second-best, and (ii) in the prognostic task of discerning stable from progressive mild cognitive impairment (mci) with an accuracy of 0.725 and mcc of 0.443, showing improvements of 10.2% and 20.5% respectively over the second-best. we achieved this prognostic result by adopting a double transfer learning strategy, which enhanced sensitivity to morphological changes and facilitated early-stage ad detection. with voxel-level precision, our method identified which specific areas are being paid attention to, identifying these predominant brain regions: the hippocampus, the amygdala, the parahippocampal, and the inferior lateral ventricles. all these areas are clinically associated with ad development. furthermore, our approach consistently found the same ad-related areas across different cross-validation folds, proving its robustness and precision in highlighting areas that align closely with known pathological markers of the disease."
"alzheimer's disease diagnostics by a deeply supervised adaptable 3d convolutional network. early diagnosis, playing an important role in preventing progress and treating the alzheimer's disease (ad), is based on classification of features extracted from brain images. the features have to accurately capture main ad-related variations of anatomical brain structures, such as, e.g., ventricles size, hippocampus shape, cortical thickness, and brain volume. this paper proposes to predict the ad with a deep 3d convolutional neural network (3d-cnn), which can learn generic features capturing ad biomarkers and adapt to different domain datasets. the 3d-cnn is built upon a 3d convolutional autoencoder, which is pre-trained to capture anatomical shape variations in structural brain mri scans. fully connected upper layers of the 3d-cnn are then fine-tuned for each task-specific ad classification. experiments on the \emph{adni} mri dataset with no skull-stripping preprocessing have shown our 3d-cnn outperforms several conventional classifiers by accuracy and robustness. abilities of the 3d-cnn to generalize the features learnt and adapt to other domains have been validated on the \emph{caddementia} dataset."
