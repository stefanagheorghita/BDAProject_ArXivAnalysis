"hierarchical graph convolutional network built by multiscale atlases for brain disorder diagnosis using functional connectivity. functional connectivity network (fcn) data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) is increasingly used for the diagnoses of brain disorders. however, state-of-the-art studies used to build the fcn using a single brain parcellation atlas at a certain spatial scale, which largely neglected functional interactions across different spatial scales in hierarchical manners. in this study, we propose a novel framework to perform multiscale fcn analysis for brain disorder diagnosis. we first use a set of well-defined multiscale atlases to compute multiscale fcns. then, we utilize biologically meaningful brain hierarchical relationships among the regions in multiscale atlases to perform nodal pooling across multiple spatial scales, namely ""atlas-guided pooling"". accordingly, we propose a multiscale-atlases-based hierarchical graph convolutional network (mahgcn), built on the stacked layers of graph convolution and the atlas-guided pooling, for a comprehensive extraction of diagnostic information from multiscale fcns. experiments on neuroimaging data from 1792 subjects demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in the diagnoses of alzheimer's disease (ad), the prodromal stage of ad (i.e., mild cognitive impairment [mci]), as well as autism spectrum disorder (asd), with accuracy of 88.9%, 78.6%, and 72.7% respectively. all results show significant advantages of our proposed method over other competing methods. this study not only demonstrates the feasibility of brain disorder diagnosis using resting-state fmri empowered by deep learning, but also highlights that the functional interactions in the multiscale brain hierarchy are worth being explored and integrated into deep learning network architectures for better understanding the neuropathology of brain disorders."
"brain-hgcn: a hyperbolic graph convolutional network for brain functional network analysis. functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) provides a powerful non-invasive window into the brain's functional organization by generating complex functional networks, typically modeled as graphs. these brain networks exhibit a hierarchical topology that is crucial for cognitive processing. however, due to inherent spatial constraints, standard euclidean gnns struggle to represent these hierarchical structures without high distortion, limiting their clinical performance. to address this limitation, we propose brain-hgcn, a geometric deep learning framework based on hyperbolic geometry, which leverages the intrinsic property of negatively curved space to model the brain's network hierarchy with high fidelity. grounded in the lorentz model, our model employs a novel hyperbolic graph attention layer with a signed aggregation mechanism to distinctly process excitatory and inhibitory connections, ultimately learning robust graph-level representations via a geometrically sound fr\'echet mean for graph readout. experiments on two large-scale fmri datasets for psychiatric disorder classification demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms a wide range of state-of-the-art euclidean baselines. this work pioneers a new geometric deep learning paradigm for fmri analysis, highlighting the immense potential of hyperbolic gnns in the field of computational psychiatry."
"estimating the intrinsic dimension in fmri space via dataset fractal analysis - counting the `cpu cores' of the human brain. functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) is a powerful non-invasive tool for localizing and analyzing brain activity. this study focuses on one very important aspect of the functional properties of human brain, specifically the estimation of the level of parallelism when performing complex cognitive tasks. using fmri as the main modality, the human brain activity is investigated through a purely data-driven signal processing and dimensionality analysis approach. specifically, the fmri signal is treated as a multi-dimensional data space and its intrinsic `complexity' is studied via dataset fractal analysis and blind-source separation (bss) methods. one simulated and two real fmri datasets are used in combination with independent component analysis (ica) and fractal analysis for estimating the intrinsic (true) dimensionality, in order to provide data-driven experimental evidence on the number of independent brain processes that run in parallel when visual or visuo-motor tasks are performed. although this number is can not be defined as a strict threshold but rather as a continuous range, when a specific activation level is defined, a corresponding number of parallel processes or the casual equivalent of `cpu cores' can be detected in normal human brain activity."
