"mm algorithms for statistical estimation in quantile regression. quantile regression \parencite{koenker1978} is a robust and practically useful way to efficiently model quantile varying correlation and predict varied response quantiles of interest. this article constructs and tests mm algorithms, which are simple to code and have been suggested superior to some other prominent quantile regression methods in nonregularized problems \parencite{pietrosanu2017}, in an array of linear quantile regression settings. simulation studies comparing mm to existing tested methods and applications to various real data sets have corroborated our algorithms' effectiveness."
"semiparametric model averaging for high dimensional conditional quantile prediction. in this article, we propose a penalized high dimensional semiparametric model average quantile prediction approach that is robust for forecasting the conditional quantile of the response. we consider a two-step estimation procedure. in the first step, we use a local linear regression approach to estimate the individual marginal quantile functions, and approximate the conditional quantile of the response by an affine combination of one-dimensional marginal quantile regression functions. in the second step, based on the nonparametric kernel estimates of the marginal quantile regression functions, we utilize a penalized method to estimate the suitable model weights vector involved in the approximation. the objective of the second step is to select significant variables whose marginal quantile functions make a significant contribution to estimating the joint multivariate conditional quantile function. under some mild conditions, we have established the asymptotic properties of the proposed robust estimator. finally, simulations and a real data analysis have been used to illustrate the proposed method."
"nearly semiparametric efficient estimation of quantile regression. as a competitive alternative to least squares regression, quantile regression is popular in analyzing heterogenous data. for quantile regression model specified for one single quantile level $\tau$, major difficulties of semiparametric efficient estimation are the unavailability of a parametric efficient score and the conditional density estimation. in this paper, with the help of the least favorable submodel technique, we first derive the semiparametric efficient scores for linear quantile regression models that are assumed for a single quantile level, multiple quantile levels and all the quantile levels in $(0,1)$ respectively. our main discovery is a one-step (nearly) semiparametric efficient estimation for the regression coefficients of the quantile regression models assumed for multiple quantile levels, which has several advantages: it could be regarded as an optimal way to pool information across multiple/other quantiles for efficiency gain; it is computationally feasible and easy to implement, as the initial estimator is easily available; due to the nature of quantile regression models under investigation, the conditional density estimation is straightforward by plugging in an initial estimator. the resulting estimator is proved to achieve the corresponding semiparametric efficiency lower bound under regularity conditions. numerical studies including simulations and an example of birth weight of children confirms that the proposed estimator leads to higher efficiency compared with the koenker-bassett quantile regression estimator for all quantiles of interest."
