"large-p_t production of d mesons at the lhcb in the parton reggeization approach. the production of d mesons in proton-proton collisions at the lhcb detector is studied. we consider the single production of d^0, d^+, d^star, and d_s^+ mesons and correlation spectra in the production of dbard and dd pairs at the sqrt{s}=7 tev and sqrt{s}=13 tev. in case of the single d-meson production we calculate differential cross sections over transverse momentum p_t while in the pair dbard,dd-meson production the cross sections are calculated over the azimuthal angle difference, rapidity difference, invariant mass of the pair m and over the p_t of the one meson from a pair. the cross sections are obtained at the leading order of the parton reggeization approach using kimber-martin-ryskin unintegrated parton distribution functions in a proton. to describe the d-meson production we use universal scale-dependent c-quark and gluon fragmentation functions fitted to e^+e^- annihilation data from cern lep1. our predictions find a good agreement with the lhcb collaboration data within uncertainties and without free parameters."
"production of d* mesons with dijets in deep-inelastic scattering at hera. inclusive d* production is measured in deep-inelastic ep scattering at hera with the h1 detector. in addition, the production of dijets in events with a d* meson is investigated. the analysis covers values of photon virtuality 2< q^2 <=100 gev^2 and of inelasticity 0.05<= y <= 0.7. differential cross sections are measured as a function of q^2 and x and of various d* meson and jet observables. within the experimental and theoretical uncertainties all measured cross sections are found to be adequately described by next-to-leading order (nlo) qcd calculations, based on the photon-gluon fusion process and dglap evolution, without the need for an additional resolved component of the photon beyond what is included at nlo. a reasonable description of the data is also achieved by a prediction based on the ccfm evolution of partons involving the k_t-unintegrated gluon distribution of the proton."
the quark and gluon structure of the proton. in this article we present a review of the structure of the proton and the current status of our knowledge of the parton distribution functions (pdfs). the lepton-nucleon scattering experiments which provide the main constraints in pdf extractions are introduced and their measurements are discussed. particular emphasis is given to the hera data which cover a wide kinematic region. hadron-hadron scattering measurements which provide supplementary information are also discussed. the methods used by various groups to extract the pdfs in qcd analyses of hard scattering data are presented and their results are compared. the use of existing measurements allows predictions for cross sections at the lhc to be made. a comparison of these predictions for selected processes is given. first measurements from the lhc experiments are compared to predictions and some initial studies of the impact of this new data on the pdfs are presented.
