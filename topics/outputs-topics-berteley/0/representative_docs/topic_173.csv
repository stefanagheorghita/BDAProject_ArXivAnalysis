"first cohomology groups for finite groups of lie type in defining characteristic. let g be a finite group of lie type, defined over a field k of characteristic p > 0. we find explicit bounds for the dimension of the first cohomology group for g with coefficients in a simple kg-module. we proceed by bounding the number of composition factors of weyl modules for simple algebraic groups independently of p and using this to deduce bounds for the 1-cohomology of simple algebraic groups. finally, we use this to obtain estimations for the growth rate of the maximum dimension {\gamma_l} of these 1-cohomology groups over all groups of lie type of rank l. we find that log \gamma_l is o(l^3 log l) (or if the lusztig conjecture holds, o(l^2 log l))."
"complete reducibility in good characteristic. let $g$ be a simple algebraic group of exceptional type, over an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p \ge 0$. a closed subgroup $h$ of $g$ is called $g$-completely reducible ($g$-cr) if whenever $h$ is contained in a parabolic subgroup $p$ of $g$, it is contained in a levi subgroup of $p$. in this paper we determine the $g$-conjugacy classes of non-$g$-cr simple connected subgroups of $g$ when $p$ is good for $g$. for each such subgroup $x$, we determine the action of $x$ on the adjoint module $l(g)$ and the connected centraliser of $x$ in $g$. as a consequence we classify all non-$g$-cr connected reductive subgroups of $g$, and determine their connected centralisers. we also classify the subgroups of $g$ which are maximal among connected reductive subgroups, but not maximal among all connected subgroups."
"unicity of a1-subgroups associated to unipotent elements in simple algebraic groups. let k be an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic and g a simple algebraic group defined over k. under the assumption that the characteristic is a good prime for g, we determine a maximal g-stable subvariety u' of the variety of unipotent elements of g such that for all u in u' any two a1-subgroups of g containing u are g-conjugate. this result establishes to what degree an analogue of the jacobson-morozov theorem for lie algebras is valid for simple algebraic groups defined over fields of (good) positive characteristic"
