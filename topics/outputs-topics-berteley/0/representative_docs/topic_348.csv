"the impact of nodes of information dissemination on epidemic spreading in dynamic multiplex networks. epidemic spreading processes on dynamic multiplex networks provide a more accurate description of natural spreading processes than those on single layered networks. to describe the influence of different individuals in the awareness layer on epidemic spreading, we propose a two-layer network-based epidemic spreading model, including some individuals who neglect the epidemic, and we explore how individuals with different properties in the awareness layer will affect the spread of epidemics. the two-layer network model is divided into an information transmission layer and a disease spreading layer. each node in the layer represents an individual with different connections in different layers. individuals with awareness will be infected with a lower probability compared to unaware individuals, which corresponds to the various epidemic prevention measures in real life. we adopt the micro-markov chain approach to analytically derive the threshold for the proposed epidemic model, which demonstrates that the awareness layer affects the threshold of disease spreading. we then explore how individuals with different properties would affect the disease spreading process through extensive monte carlo numerical simulations. we find that individuals with high centrality in the awareness layer would significantly inhibit the transmission of infectious diseases. additionally, we propose conjectures and explanations for the approximately linear effect of individuals with low centrality in the awareness layer on the number of infected individuals."
"coupled effects of epidemic information and risk awareness on contagion. by incorporating delayed epidemic information and self-restricted travel behavior into the sis model, we have investigated the coupled effects of timely and accurate epidemic information and people's sensitivity to the epidemic information on contagion. in the population with only local random movement, whether the epidemic information is delayed or not has no effect on the spread of the epidemic. people's high sensitivity to the epidemic information leads to their risk aversion behavior and the spread of the epidemic is suppressed. in the population with only global person-to-person movement, timely and accurate epidemic information helps an individual cut off the connections with the infected in time and the epidemic is brought under control in no time. a delay in the epidemic information leads to an individual's misjudgment of who has been infected and who has not, which in turn leads to rapid progress and a higher peak of the epidemic. in the population with coexistence of local and global movement, timely and accurate epidemic information and people's high sensitivity to the epidemic information play an important role in curbing the epidemic. a theoretical analysis indicates that people's misjudgment caused by the delayed epidemic information leads to a higher encounter probability between the susceptible and the infected and people's self-restricted travel behavior helps reduce such an encounter probability. a functional relation between the ratio of infected individuals and the susceptible-infected encounter probability has been found."
"effect of heterogeneous transmission rate on epidemic spreading over scale free networks. in the present work the spread of epidemic is studied over complex networks which are characterized by power law degree distribution of links and heterogeneous rate of disease transmission. the random allocation of epidemic transmission rates to the nodes results in the heterogeneity, which in turn causes the segregation of nodes in terms of various sub populations. the aim of the study is to gain microscopic insight into the effect of interactions among various sub populations in the spreading processes of disease over such networks. the discrete time markov chain method based upon the susceptible infected susceptible (sis) model of diseases transmission has been used to describe the spreading of epidemic over the networks. the study is parameterized in terms of variable $\lambda$, defined as the number of contacts a node makes with the fraction of its neighboring nodes. from the simulation results, it is found that the spread of epidemic on such networks is critical in terms of number of minimum contacts made by a node below which there is no outbreak of disease. the degree of infection in these networks is assessed from the size of epidemic defined in terms of fraction of infected nodes of the total number and their corresponding level of infection. the results of the parametric study demonstrates the dependence of the epidemic size upon number of concurrent contacts made by a node ($\lambda$ ) and the average number of links per node. in both these cases, the size of the epidemic is found to increase with the corresponding increase in respective parameters."
