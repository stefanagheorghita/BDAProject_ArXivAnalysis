"a model for star formation in cosmological simulations of galaxy formation. we present a new model to describe the star formation process in galaxies, which includes the description of the different gas phases -- molecular, atomic, and ionized -- together with its metal content. the model, which will be coupled to cosmological simulations of galaxy formation, will be used to investigate the relation between the star formation rate (sfr) and the formation of molecular hydrogen. the model follows the time evolution of the molecular, atomic and ionized phases in a gas cloud and estimates the amount of stellar mass formed, by solving a set of five coupled differential equations. as expected, we find a positive, strong correlation between the molecular fraction and the initial gas density, which manifests in a positive correlation between the initial gas density and the sfr of the cloud."
"detection of molecular gas in void galaxies : implications for star formation in isolated environments. we present the detection of molecular gas from galaxies located in nearby voids using the co line emission as a tracer. the observations were done using the 45m nobeyama radio telescope. void galaxies lie in the most under dense parts of our universe and a significant fraction of them are gas rich, late type spiral galaxies. although isolated, they have ongoing star formation but appear to be slowly evolving compared to galaxies in denser environments. not much is known about their star formation properties or cold gas content. in this study we searched for molecular gas in five void galaxies. the galaxies were selected based on their relatively high iras fluxes or ha line luminosities, both of which signify ongoing star formation. all five galaxies appear to be isolated and two lie within the bootes void. we detected co line emission from four of the five galaxies in our sample and the molecular gas masses lie between 10^8 to 10^9 msolar. we did follow-up ha imaging observations of three detected galaxies using the himalayan chandra telescope and determined their star formation rates (sfrs). the sfr varies from 0.2 to 1 msolar/yr, which is similar to that observed in local galaxies. our study indicates that although void galaxies reside in under dense regions, their disks contain molecular gas and have star formation rates similar to galaxies in denser environments."
"molecular gas and star formation in voids. we present the detection of molecular gas using co(1-0) line emission and follow up halpha imaging observations of galaxies located in nearby voids. the co(1-0) observations were done using the 45m telescope of the nobeyama radio observatory (nro) and the optical observations were done using the himalayan chandra telescope (hct). although void galaxies lie in the most under dense parts of our universe, a significant fraction of them are gas rich, spiral galaxies that show signatures of ongoing star formation. not much is known about their cold gas content or star formation properties. in this study we searched for molecular gas in five void galaxies using the nro. the galaxies were selected based on their relatively higher iras fluxes or halpha line luminosities. co(1--0) emission was detected in four galaxies and the derived molecular gas masses lie between (1 - 8)e+9 msun. the h$\alpha$ imaging observations of three galaxies detected in co emission indicates ongoing star formation and the derived star formation rates vary between from 0.2 - 1.0 msun/yr, which is similar to that observed in local galaxies. our study shows that although void galaxies reside in under dense regions, their disks may contain molecular gas and have star formation rates similar to galaxies in denser environments."
