"geometrical structure of laplacian eigenfunctions. we summarize the properties of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the laplace operator in bounded euclidean domains with dirichlet, neumann or robin boundary condition. we keep the presentation at a level accessible to scientists from various disciplines ranging from mathematics to physics and computer sciences. the main focus is put onto multiple intricate relations between the shape of a domain and the geometrical structure of eigenfunctions."
"geometric optimization of the first robin eigenvalue in exterior domains. this paper addresses the geometric optimization problem of the first robin eigenvalue in exterior domains, specifically the lowest point of the spectrum of the laplace operator under robin boundary conditions in the complement of a bounded domain. in contrast to the laplace operator on bounded domains, the spectrum of this operator is not purely discrete. the discrete nature of the first eigenvalue depends on the parameter of the robin boundary condition. in two dimensions, d. krejcirik and v. lotoreichik show that the ball maximizes the first robin eigenvalue among all smooth, bounded, simply connected sets with given perimeter or given area, provided the eigenvalue is discrete. we extend these findings to higher dimensions. the discrete spectrum of the laplace operator under robin boundary conditions can be characterized through the steklov eigenvalue problem in exterior domains, a topic studied by g. auchmuty and q. han. assuming that the lowest point of the spectrum is a discrete eigenvalue, we show that the ball is a local maximizer among nearly spherical domains with prescribed measure. however, in general, the ball does not emerge as the global maximizer for the first robin eigenvalue under either prescribed measure or prescribed perimeter."
"quantitative spectral stability for the neumann laplacian in domains with small holes. the aim of the present paper is to investigate the behavior of the spectrum of the neumann laplacian in domains with little holes excised from the interior. more precisely, we consider the eigenvalues of the laplacian with homogeneous neumann boundary conditions on a bounded, lipschitz domain. then, we singularly perturb the domain by removing lipschitz sets which are ""small"" in a suitable sense and satisfy a uniform extension property. in this context, we provide an asymptotic expansion for all the eigenvalues of the perturbed problem which are converging to simple eigenvalues of the limit one. the eigenvalue variation turns out to depend on a geometric quantity resembling the notion of (boundary) torsional rigidity: understanding this fact is one of the main contributions of the present paper. in the particular case of a hole shrinking to a point, through a fine blow-up analysis, we identify the exact vanishing order of such a quantity and we establish some connections between the location of the hole and the sign of the eigenvalue variation."
