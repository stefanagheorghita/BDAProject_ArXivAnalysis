"spin nematic order and superconductivity in $j_1$-$j_2$ kondo lattice model on square lattice. we investigate competition and cooperation of magnetic frustration and the kondo effect in the $j_1$-$j_2$ kondo lattice model on the square lattice at zero temperature. in this model, the frustrated interactions $j_1,j_2$ between the localized spins stabilize spin nematic orders, while the kondo coupling favors local spin singlets. using the slave boson mean field approximation, we find that the spin nematic order remains stable against small kondo coupling, and the localized spins and the conduction electrons are effectively decoupled. on the other hand, a standard fermi liquid state is formed for sufficiently strong kondo interactions. furthermore, in an intermediate region with moderate kondo coupling, the spin nematic order and the kondo effect coexist, and superconducting pairing of the conduction electrons is induced by the spinon pairing. we discuss the ground state phase diagram and nature of the quantum phase transitions between the different superconducting states."
"molecular kondo effect in flat-band lattices. the kondo effect of a single magnetic impurity embedded in the lieb lattice is studied by the numerical renormalization group. when the band flatness is present in the local density of states, it quenches the participation of all dispersive electrons in the kondo singlet formation, and reduces the many-body kondo problem to a two-electron molecular kondo problem. the two-electron analog of the many-body kondo singlet, a quantum entanglement of two spins, is stable at low temperature, and the impurity contributions to thermodynamical and dynamical quantities are qualitatively different from that obtained in the conventional kondo effect in systems without flat bands. the existence conditions of the molecular kondo effect in narrow band systems are also discussed."
"from kondo effect to weak-link regime in quantum spin-1/2 spin chains. we analyze the crossover from kondo to weak-link regime by means of a model of tunable bond impurities in the middle of a spin-1/2 xxz heisenberg chain. we study the kondo screening cloud and estimate the kondo length by combining perturbative renormalization group approach with the exact numerical calculation of the integrated real-space spin-spin correlation functions. we show that, when the spin impurity is symmetrically coupled to the two parts of the chain with realistic values of the kondo coupling strengths and spin-parity symmetry is preserved, the kondo length takes values within the reach of nowadays experimental technology in ultracold-atom setups. in the case of non-symmetric kondo couplings and/or spin parity broken by a nonzero magnetic field applied to the impurity, we discuss how kondo screening redistributes among the chain as a function of the asymmetry in the couplings and map out the shrinking of the kondo length when the magnetic field induces a crossover from kondo impurity to weak-link physics."
