on some numerical radius inequalities for hilbert space operators. this article is devoted to studying some new numerical radius inequalities for hilbert space operators. our analysis enables us to improve an earlier bound of numerical radius due to kittaneh.
"generalized euclidean operator radius. in this paper, we introduce the $f-$operator radius of hilbert space operators as a generalization of the euclidean operator radius and the $q-$operator radius. properties of the newly defined radius are discussed, emphasizing how it extends some known results in the literature."
"refinements of some numerical radius inequalities for hilbert space operators. in this work, some generalizations and refinements inequalities for numerical radius of the product of hilbert space operators are proved. new inequalities for numerical radius of block matrices of hilbert space operators are also established."
