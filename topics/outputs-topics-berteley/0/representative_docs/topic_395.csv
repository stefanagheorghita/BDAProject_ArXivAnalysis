"near-threshold $k^- d$ scattering and properties of kaonic deuterium. we calculated the $1s$ level shifts and widths of kaonic deuterium, corresponding to accurate results on near-threshold antikaon - deuteron scattering. the lippmann-schwinger eigenvalue equation with a strong $k^- - d$ and coulomb potentials was solved. the two-body $k^- - d$ potentials reproduce the near-threshold elastic amplitudes of $k^- d$ scattering obtained from the three-body alt-grassberger-sandhas equations with the coupled channels using four versions of the $\bar{k}n - \pi \sigma$ potentials. both new $\bar{k}n - \pi \sigma$ potentials reproducing the very recent siddharta data on kaonic hydrogen and our older potentials reproducing kek data have one- or two-pole versions of the $\lambda(1405)$ resonance and reproduce experimental data on $k^- p$ scattering."
"first application of a microscopic $k^-nn$ absorption model in calculations of kaonic atoms. strong interaction energy shifts and widths in kaonic atoms are calculated for the first time using microscopic $k^- n$ + $k^- nn$ potentials derived from $k^- n$ scattering amplitudes constructed within su(3) chiral coupled-channels models of meson-baryon interactions. the in-medium modifications of the free-space amplitudes due to the pauli correlations are taken into account. the $k^-n+k^-nn$ potentials evaluated for 23 nuclear species are confronted with kaonic atoms data. the description of the data significantly improves when the $k^-nn$ absorption is included. to get $\chi^2$ as low as for the $k^-n+$phenomenological multi-nucleon potential an additional phenomenological term, accounting for $k^{-}-3n(4n)$ processes, is still needed. however, density dependence of this phenomenological term points out some deficiencies in the microscopic potentials and further improvements of the applied model are thus desirable. the calculated branching ratios for $k^-n$ and $k^-nn$ absorption channels in the $^{12}$c$+k^-$ atom are in reasonable agreement with the old bubble chamber data, as well as with the latest data from the amadeus collaboration."
"deeply bound levels in kaonic atoms. using a microscopic antikaon-nucleus optical potential recently developed by ramos and oset (nucl-th/9906016, in print in nuclear physics a) from a chiral model, we calculate strong interaction shifts and widths for $k^-$ atoms. this purely theoretical potential gives an acceptable description of the measured data ($\chi^2/{\rm num.data}= 3.8$), though it turns out to be less attractive than what can be inferred from the existing kaon atomic data. we also use a modified potential, obtained by adding to the latter theoretical one a s-wave term which is fitted to known experimental kaonic data ($\chi^2/{\rm degree of freedom}= 1.6$), to predict deeply bound $k^-$ atomic levels, not detected yet. this improved potential predicts, in general, states even narrower than those recently reported by friedman and gal. (phys.let.b459, 1999, 43). this reinforces the idea that these deeply atomic states can be detected and resolved by using suitable nuclear reactions. besides, we also study $k^-$ and $\bar k^0$ nuclear bound states and compute binding energies and widths, for both species of antikaons, in $^{12}$c, $^{40}$ca and $^{208}$pb. despite of restricting our study only to potentials obtained from best fits to the known kaonic atom data, the dynamics of these nuclear bound states depend dramatically on the particular optical potential used."
