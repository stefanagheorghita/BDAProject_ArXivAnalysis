"rush-larsen time-stepping methods of high order for stiff problems in cardiac electrophysiology. to address the issues of stability and accuracy for reaction-diffusion equations, the development of high order and stable time-stepping methods is necessary. this is particularly true in the context of cardiac electrophysiology, where reaction-diffusion equations are coupled with stiff ode systems. many research have been led in that way in the past 15 years concerning implicit-explicit methods and exponential integrators. in 2009, perego and veneziani proposed an innovative time-stepping method of order 2. in this paper we present the extension of this method to the orders 3 and 4 and introduce the rush-larsen schemes of order k (shortly denoted rl\_k). the rl\_k schemes are explicit multistep exponential integrators. they display a simple general formulation and an easy implementation. the rl\_k schemes are shown to be stable under perturbation and convergent of order k. their dahlquist stability analysis is performed. they have a very large stability domain provided that the stabilizer associated with the method captures well enough the stiff modes of the problem. the rl\_k method is numerically studied as applied to the membrane equation in cardiac electrophysiology. the rl k schemes are shown to be stable under perturbation and convergent oforder k. their dahlquist stability analysis is performed. they have a very large stability domain provided that the stabilizer associated with the method captures well enough the stiff modes of the problem. the rl k method is numerically studied as applied to the membrane equation in cardiac electrophysiology."
"linearly implicit multistep methods for time integration. time integration methods for solving initial value problems are an important component of many scientific and engineering simulations. implicit time integrators are desirable for their stability properties, significantly relaxing restrictions on timestep size. however, implicit methods require solutions to one or more systems of nonlinear equations at each timestep, which for large simulations can be prohibitively expensive. this paper introduces a new family of linearly implicit multistep methods (limm), which only requires the solution of one linear system per timestep. order conditions and stability theory for these methods are presented, as well as design and implementation considerations. practical methods of order up to five are developed that have similar error coefficients, but improved stability regions, when compared to the widely used bdf methods. numerical testing of a self-starting variable stepsize and variable order implementation of the new limm methods shows measurable performance improvement over a similar bdf implementation."
"transformed implicit-explicit dimsims with strong stability preserving explicit part. for many systems of differential equations modeling problems in science and engineering, there are often natural splittings of the right hand side into two parts, one of which is non-stiff or mildly stiff, and the other part is stiff. such systems can be efficiently treated by a class of implicit-explicit (imex) diagonally implicit multistage integration methods (dimsims), where the stiff part is integrated by implicit formula, and the non-stiff part is integrated by an explicit formula. we will construct methods where the explicit part has strong stability preserving (ssp) property, and the implicit part of the method is $a$-, or $l$-stable. we will also investigate stability of these methods when the implicit and explicit parts interact with each other. to be more precise, we will monitor the size of the region of absolute stability of the imex scheme, assuming that the implicit part of the method is $a$-, or $l$-stable. finally we furnish examples of ssp imex dimsims up to the order four with good stability properties."
