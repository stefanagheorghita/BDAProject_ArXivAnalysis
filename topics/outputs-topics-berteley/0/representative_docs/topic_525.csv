"a new geometric approach to sturmian words. we introduce a new geometric approach to sturmian words by means of a mapping that associates certain lines in the n x n -grid and sets of finite sturmian words of length n. using this mapping, we give new proofs of the formulas enumerating the finite sturmian words and the palindromic finite sturmian words of a given length. we also give a new proof for the well-known result that a factor of a sturmian word has precisely two return words."
"on words with the zero palindromic defect. we study the set of finite words with zero palindromic defect, i.e., words rich in palindromes. this set is factorial, but not recurrent. we focus on description of pairs of rich words which cannot occur simultaneously as factors of a longer rich word."
"extensions of rich words. in [x. droubay et al, episturmian words and some constructions of de luca and rauzy, theoret. comput. sci. 255 (2001)], it was proved that every word w has at most |w|+1 many distinct palindromic factors, including the empty word. the unified study of words which achieve this limit was initiated in [a. glen et al, palindromic richness, eur. jour. of comb. 30 (2009)]. they called these words rich (in palindromes). this article contains several results about rich words and especially extending them. we say that a rich word w can be extended richly with a word u if wu is rich. some notions are also made about the infinite defect of a word, the number of rich words of length n and two-dimensional rich words."
