"tadpol: a 1.3 mm survey of dust polarization in star-forming cores and regions. we present {\lambda}1.3 mm carma observations of dust polarization toward 30 star-forming cores and 8 star-forming regions from the tadpol survey. we show maps of all sources, and compare the ~2.5"" resolution tadpol maps with ~20"" resolution polarization maps from single-dish submillimeter telescopes. here we do not attempt to interpret the detailed b-field morphology of each object. rather, we use average b-field orientations to derive conclusions in a statistical sense from the ensemble of sources, bearing in mind that these average orientations can be quite uncertain. we discuss three main findings: (1) a subset of the sources have consistent magnetic field (b-field) orientations between large (~20"") and small (~2.5"") scales. those same sources also tend to have higher fractional polarizations than the sources with inconsistent large-to-small-scale fields. we interpret this to mean that in at least some cases b-fields play a role in regulating the infall of material all the way down to the ~1000 au scales of protostellar envelopes. (2) outflows appear to be randomly aligned with b-fields; although, in sources with low polarization fractions there is a hint that outflows are preferentially perpendicular to small-scale b-fields, which suggests that in these sources the fields have been wrapped up by envelope rotation. (3) finally, even at ~2.5"" resolution we see the so-called ""polarization hole"" effect, where the fractional polarization drops significantly near the total intensity peak. all data are publicly available in the electronic edition of this article."
"high-angular resolution dust polarization measurements: shaped b-field lines in the massive star forming region orion bn/kl. we present observational results of the thermal dust continuum emission and its linear polarization in one of the nearest massive star-forming sites orion bn/kl in orion molecular cloud-1. the observations were carried out with the submillimeter array. with an angular resolution of 1"" (~2 mpc; 480 au), we have detected and resolved the densest cores near the bn/kl region. at a wavelength of ~870 micron, the polarized dust emission can be used to trace the structure of the magnetic field in this star-forming core. the dust continuum appears to arise from a v-shaped region, with a cavity nearly coincident with the center of the explosive outflows observed on larger scales. the position angles (p.a.s) of the observed polarization vary significantly by a total of about 90 degree but smoothly, i.e., curl-like, across the dust ridges. such a polarization pattern can be explained with dust grains being magnetically aligned instead of mechanically with outflows, since the latter mechanism would cause the p.a.s to be parallel to the direction of the outflow, i.e., radial-like. the magnetic field projected in the plane of sky is therefore derived by rotating the p.a.s of the polarization by 90 degree. we find an azimuthally symmetric structure in the overall magnetic field morphology, with the field directions pointing toward 2.5"" west to the center of the explosive outflows. we also find a preferred symmetry plane at a p.a. of 36 degree, which is perpendicular to the mean magnetic field direction (120 degree) of the 0.5 pc dust ridge. two possible interpretations of the origin of the observed magnetic field structure are discussed."
"outflows, cores and magnetic field orientations in w43-mm1 as seen by alma. it has been proposed that the magnetic field, pervasive in the ism, plays an important role in the process of massive star formation. to better understand its impact at the pre and protostellar stages, high-angular resolution observations of polarized dust emission toward a large sample of massive dense cores are needed. to this end, we used the atacama large millimeter array in band 6 (1.3 mm) in full polarization mode to map the polarized emission from dust grains at a physical scale of $\sim$2700 au in the massive protocluster w43-mm1. we used these data to measure the orientation of the magnetic field at the core scale. then, we examined the relative orientations of the core-scale magnetic field, of the protostellar outflows determined from co molecular line emission, and of the major axis of the dense cores determined from 2d gaussian fit in the continuum emission. we found that the orientation of the dense cores is not random with respect to the magnetic field. instead, the dense cores are compatible with being oriented 20-50$^\deg$ with respect to the magnetic field. the outflows could be oriented 50-70$^\deg$ with respect to the magnetic field, or randomly oriented with respect to the magnetic field, similar to current results in low-mass star-forming regions. in conclusion, the observed alignment of the position angle of the cores with respect to the magnetic field lines shows that the magnetic field is well coupled with the dense material; however, the 20-50$^\deg$ preferential orientation contradicts the predictions of the magnetically-controlled core-collapse models. the potential correlation of the outflow directions with respect to the magnetic field suggests that, in some cases, the magnetic field is strong enough to control the angular momentum distribution from the core scale down to the inner part of the circumstellar disks where outflows are triggered."
