"pku-goodsad: a supermarket goods dataset for unsupervised anomaly detection and segmentation. visual anomaly detection is essential and commonly used for many tasks in the field of computer vision. recent anomaly detection datasets mainly focus on industrial automated inspection, medical image analysis and video surveillance. in order to broaden the application and research of anomaly detection in unmanned supermarkets and smart manufacturing, we introduce the supermarket goods anomaly detection (goodsad) dataset. it contains 6124 high-resolution images of 484 different appearance goods divided into 6 categories. each category contains several common different types of anomalies such as deformation, surface damage and opened. anomalies contain both texture changes and structural changes. it follows the unsupervised setting and only normal (defect-free) images are used for training. pixel-precise ground truth regions are provided for all anomalies. moreover, we also conduct a thorough evaluation of current state-of-the-art unsupervised anomaly detection methods. this initial benchmark indicates that some methods which perform well on the industrial anomaly detection dataset (e.g., mvtec ad), show poor performance on our dataset. this is a comprehensive, multi-object dataset for supermarket goods anomaly detection that focuses on real-world applications."
"discriminative feature learning framework with gradient preference for anomaly detection. unsupervised representation learning has been extensively employed in anomaly detection, achieving impressive performance. extracting valuable feature vectors that can remarkably improve the performance of anomaly detection are essential in unsupervised representation learning. to this end, we propose a novel discriminative feature learning framework with gradient preference for anomaly detection. specifically, we firstly design a gradient preference based selector to store powerful feature points in space and then construct a feature repository, which alleviate the interference of redundant feature vectors and improve inference efficiency. to overcome the looseness of feature vectors, secondly, we present a discriminative feature learning with center constrain to map the feature repository to a compact subspace, so that the anomalous samples are more distinguishable from the normal ones. moreover, our method can be easily extended to anomaly localization. extensive experiments on popular industrial and medical anomaly detection datasets demonstrate our proposed framework can achieve competitive results in both anomaly detection and localization. more important, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art in few shot anomaly detection."
"dual-interrelated diffusion model for few-shot anomaly image generation. the performance of anomaly inspection in industrial manufacturing is constrained by the scarcity of anomaly data. to overcome this challenge, researchers have started employing anomaly generation approaches to augment the anomaly dataset. however, existing anomaly generation methods suffer from limited diversity in the generated anomalies and struggle to achieve a seamless blending of this anomaly with the original image. moreover, the generated mask is usually not aligned with the generated anomaly. in this paper, we overcome these challenges from a new perspective, simultaneously generating a pair of the overall image and the corresponding anomaly part. we propose dualanodiff, a novel diffusion-based few-shot anomaly image generation model, which can generate diverse and realistic anomaly images by using a dual-interrelated diffusion model, where one of them is employed to generate the whole image while the other one generates the anomaly part. moreover, we extract background and shape information to mitigate the distortion and blurriness phenomenon in few-shot image generation. extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model over state-of-the-art methods in terms of diversity, realism and the accuracy of mask. overall, our approach significantly improves the performance of downstream anomaly inspection tasks, including anomaly detection, anomaly localization, and anomaly classification tasks."
