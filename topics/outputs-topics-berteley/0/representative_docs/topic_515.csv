"orbital and asymptotic stability of a train of peakons for the novikov equation. the novikov equation is an integrable camassa-holm type equation with cubic nonlinearity. one of the most important features of this equation is the existence of peakon and multi-peakon solutions, i.e. peaked traveling waves behaving as solitons. this paper aims to prove both, the orbital and asymptotic stability of peakon trains solutions, i.e. multi-peakon solutions such that their initial configuration is increasingly ordered. furthermore, we give an improvement of the orbital stability of a single peakon so that we can drop the non-negativity hypothesis on the momentum density. the same result also holds for the orbital stability for peakon trains, i.e. in this latter case we can also avoid assuming non-negativity of the initial momentum density. finally, as a corollary of these results together with some asymptotic formulas for the position and momenta vectors for multi-peakon solutions, we obtain the orbital and asymptotic stability for initially not well-ordered multipeakons."
"an integrable pseudospherical equation with pseudo-peakon solutions. we study an integrable equation whose solutions define a triad of one-forms describing a surface with gaussian curvature -1. we identify a local group of diffeomorphisms that preserve these solutions and establish conserved quantities. from the symmetries, we obtain invariant solutions that provide explicit metrics for the surfaces. these solutions are unbounded and often appear in mirrored pairs. we introduce the ``collage'' method, which uses conserved quantities to remove unbounded parts and smoothly join the solutions, leading to weak solutions consistent with the conserved quantities. as a result we get pseudo-peakons, which are smoother than camassa-holm peakons. additionally, we apply a miura-type transformation to relate our equation to the degasperis-procesi equation, allowing us to recover peakon and shock-peakon solutions for it from the solutions of the other equation."
"solitons, peakons and periodic cusp wave solutions for the fornberg-whitham equation. in this paper, we employ the bifurcation method of dynamical systems to investigate the exact travelling wave solutions for the fornberg-whitham equation. the implicit expression for solitons is given. the explicit expressions for peakons and periodic cusp wave solutions are also obtained. further, we show that the limits of soliton solutions and periodic cusp wave solutions are peakons."
