"shannon wavelet approximations of linear differential operators. recent works emphasized the interest of numerical solution of pde's with wavelets. in their works, a.cohen, w.dahmen and r.devore focussed on the non linear approximation aspect of the wavelet approximation of pde's to prove the relevance of such methods. in order to extend these results, we focuss on the convergence of the iterative algorithm, and we consider different possibilities offered by the wavelet theory: the tensorial wavelets and the derivation/integration of wavelet bases. we also investigate the use of wavelet packets. we apply these extended results to prove in the case of the shannon wavelets, the convergence of the leray projector algorithm with divergence-free wavelets."
"quadratic spline wavelets with short support satisfying homogeneous boundary conditions. in the paper, we construct a new quadratic spline-wavelet basis on the interval and a unit square satisfying homogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions of the first order. wavelets have one vanishing moment and the shortest support among known quadratic spline wavelets adapted to the same type of boundary conditions. stiffness matrices arising from a discretization of the second-order elliptic problems using the constructed wavelet basis have uniformly bounded condition numbers and the condition numbers are small. we present quantitative properties of the constructed basis. we provide numerical examples to show that the galerkin method and the adaptive wavelet method using our wavelet basis requires smaller number of iterations than these methods with other quadratic spline wavelet bases. moreover, due to the short support of the wavelets one iteration requires smaller number of floating point operations."
"smooth parseval frames for $l^2(\mathbb{r})$ and generalizations to $l^2(\mathbb{r}^d)$. wavelet set wavelets were the first examples of wavelets that may not have associated multiresolution analyses. furthermore, they provided examples of complete orthonormal wavelet systems in $l^2(\mathbb{r}^d)$ which only require a single generating wavelet. although work had been done to smooth these wavelets, which are by definition discontinuous on the frequency domain, nothing had been explicitly done over $\mathbb{r}^d$, $d >1$. this paper, along with another one cowritten by the author, finally addresses this issue. smoothing does not work as expected in higher dimensions. for example, bin han's proof of existence of schwartz class functions which are parseval frame wavelets and approximate parseval frame wavelet set wavelets does not easily generalize to higher dimensions. however, a construction of wavelet sets in $\hat{\mathbb{r}}^d$ which may be smoothed is presented. finally, it is shown that a commonly used class of functions cannot be the result of convolutional smoothing of a wavelet set wavelet."
