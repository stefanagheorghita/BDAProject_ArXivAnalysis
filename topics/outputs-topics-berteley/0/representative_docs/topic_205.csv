"an extended dirac equation in noncommutative space-time. stabilizing, by deformation, the algebra of relativistic quantum mechanics a non-commutative space-time geometry is obtained. the exterior algebra of this geometry leads to an extended massless dirac equation which has both a massless and a large mass solution. the nature of the solutions is discussed, as well as the effects of coupling the two solutions."
"twisting all the way: from classical mechanics to quantum fields. we discuss the effects that a noncommutative geometry induced by a drinfeld twist has on physical theories. we systematically deform all products and symmetries of the theory. we discuss noncommutative classical mechanics, in particular its deformed poisson bracket and hence time evolution and symmetries. the twisting is then extended to classical fields, and then to the main interest of this work: quantum fields. this leads to a geometric formulation of quantization on noncommutative spacetime, i.e. we establish a noncommutative correspondence principle from *-poisson brackets to *-commutators. in particular commutation relations among creation and annihilation operators are deduced."
"dirac operators on noncommutative curved spacetimes. we study the notion of a dirac operator in the framework of twist-deformed noncommutative geometry. we provide a number of well-motivated candidate constructions and propose a minimal set of axioms that a noncommutative dirac operator should satisfy. these criteria turn out to be restrictive, but they do not fix a unique construction: two of our operators generally satisfy the axioms, and we provide an explicit example where they are inequivalent. for highly symmetric spacetimes with drinfeld twists constructed from sufficiently many killing vector fields, all of our operators coincide. for general noncommutative curved spacetimes we find that demanding formal self-adjointness as an additional condition singles out a preferred choice among our candidates. based on this noncommutative dirac operator we construct a quantum field theory of dirac fields. in the last part we study noncommutative dirac operators on deformed minkowski and ads spacetimes as explicit examples."
