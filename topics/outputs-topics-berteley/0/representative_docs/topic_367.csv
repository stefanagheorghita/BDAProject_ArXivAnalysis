"an hst/wfc3-ir morphological survey of galaxies at z = 1.5-3.6: i. survey description and morphological properties of star forming galaxies. we present the results of a 42-orbit hst/wfc3 survey of the rest-frame optical morphologies of star forming galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in the range z=1.5-3.6. the survey consists of 42 orbits of f160w imaging covering ~65 arcmin^2 distributed widely across the sky and reaching a depth of 27.9 ab for a 5 sigma detection within a 0.2 arcsec radius aperture. focusing on an optically selected sample of 306 star forming galaxies with stellar masses in the range m* = 10^9 - 10^11 msun, we find that typical circularized effective half-light radii range from ~ 0.7 - 3.0 kpc and describe a stellar mass - radius relation as early as z ~ 3. while these galaxies are best described by an exponential surface brightness profile, their distribution of axis ratios is strongly inconsistent with a population of inclined exponential disks and is better reproduced by triaxial stellar systems with minor/major and intermediate/major axis ratios ~ 0.3 and 0.7 respectively. while rest-uv and rest-optical morphologies are generally similar for a subset of galaxies with hst/acs imaging data, differences are more pronounced at higher masses m* > 3 x 10^10 msun. finally, we discuss galaxy morphology in the context of efforts to constrain the merger fraction, finding that morphologically-identified mergers/non-mergers generally have insignificant differences in terms of physical observables such as stellar mass and star formation rate, although merger-like galaxies selected according to some criteria have statistically smaller effective radii and correspondingly larger sfr surface density."
"sinfoni/vlt 3d spectroscopy of massive galaxies: evidence of rotational support at z~1.4. there is cumulative evidence showing that, for the most massive galaxies, the fraction of disk-like objects compared to those with spheroidal properties increases with redshift. however, this evolution is thus far based on the surface brightness study of these objects. to explore the consistency of this scenario, it is necessary to measure the dynamical status of these galaxies. with this aim we have obtained seeing-limited near-infrared integral field spectra in the h-band for 10 massive galaxies (m_{stellar} >10^{11} h_{70}^-2 m_{sun}) at z~1.4 with sinfoni at the vlt. our sample is selected by their stellar mass and ew[oii] > 15 \aa, to secure their kinematic measurements, but without accounting for any morphological or flux criteria a priori. through this 3d kinematic spectroscopy analysis we find that half (i.e. 50+/-7%) of our galaxies are compatible with being rotationally supported disks, in agreement with previous morphological expectations. this is a factor of approximately two higher than what is observed in the present universe for objects of the same stellar mass. strikingly, the majority of our sample of massive galaxies show extended and fairly high rotational velocity maps, implying that massive galaxies acquire rapidly rotational support and hence gravitational equilibrium. our sample also show evidence for ongoing interactions and mergers. summarizing, massive galaxies at high-z show a significant diversity and must have continued evolution beyond the fading of stellar populations, to become their present day counterparts."
"mass assembly in quiescent and star-forming galaxies since z=4 from ultravista. we estimate the galaxy stellar mass function and stellar mass density for star-forming and quiescent galaxies with 0.2<z<4. we construct a deep k<24 sample of 220000 galaxies selected using the ultravista dr1 data release. our analysis is based on precise 30-band photometric redshifts. by comparing these photometric redshifts with 10800 spectroscopic redshifts from the zcosmos bright and faint surveys, we find a precision of sigma(dz/(1+z))=0.008 at i<22.5 and sigma(dz/(1+zs))=0.03 at 1.5<z<4. we derive the stellar mass function and correct for the eddington bias. we find a mass-dependent evolution of the global and star-forming populations. this mass-dependent evolution is a direct consequence of the star formation being quenched in galaxies more massive than m>10^10.7msun. for the mass function of the quiescent galaxies, we do not find any significant evolution of the high-mass end at z<1; however we observe a clear flattening of the faint-end slope. from z~3 to z~1, the density of quiescent galaxies increases over the entire mass range. their comoving stellar mass density increases by 1.6 dex between z~3 and z~1 and by less than 0.2dex at z<1. we infer the star formation history from the mass density evolution and we find an excellent agreement with instantaneous star formation rate measurements at z<1.5, while we find differences of 0.2dex at z>1.5 consistent with the expected uncertainties. we also develop a new method to infer the specific star formation rate from the mass function of star-forming galaxies. we find that the specific star formation rate of 10^10msun galaxies increases continuously in the redshift range 1<z<4. finally, we compare our results with a semi-analytical model and find that these models overestimate the density of low mass quiescent galaxies by an order of magnitude, while the density of low-mass star-forming galaxies is successfully reproduced."
