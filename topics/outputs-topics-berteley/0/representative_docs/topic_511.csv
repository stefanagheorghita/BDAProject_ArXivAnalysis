"smooth actions of connected compact lie groups with a free point are determined by two vector fields. consider a smooth action $\mathbf g\times m \rightarrow m$ of a compact connected lie group $\mathbf g$ on a connected manifold $m$. assume the existence of a point of $m$ whose isotropy group has a single element (free point). then we prove that there exist two complete vector field $x,x_1$ such that their group of automorphisms equals $\mathbf g$ regarded as a group of diffeomorphisms of $m$ (the existence of a free point implies that the action of $\mathbf g$ is effective). moreover, some examples of effective actions with no free point where this result fails are exhibited."
"connectivity properties of group actions on non-positively curved spaces i: controlled connectivity and openness results. let g be a group and let m be a cat(0) proper metric space (e.g. a simply connected complete riemannian manifold of non-positive sectional curvature or a locally finite tree). isometric actions of g on m are (by definition) points in the space r := hom(g, isom(m)) with the compact open topology. sample theorems: 1. the cocompact actions form an open subset of r. 2. the cocompact actions with discrete orbits whose point-stabilizers have type f_n form an open subset of the subspace of r consisting of all actions with discrete orbits. (f_1 means finitely generated, f_2 means finitely presented etc.) the key idea is to introduce a new ""controlled topology"" invariant of such actions - dependent on n - which is unfamiliar when the orbits are not discrete but which becomes familiar (cf 2.) when the orbits are discrete. (this is the first of two papers.)"
"when is a group action determined by its orbit structure?. we present a simple approach to questions of topological orbit equivalence for actions of countable groups on topological and smooth manifolds. for example, for any action of a countable group $\gamma$ on a topological manifold where the fixed sets for any element are contained in codimension two submanifolds, every orbit equivalence is equivariant. even in the presence of larger fixed sets, for actions preserving rigid geometric structures our results force sufficiently smooth orbit equivalences to be equivariant. for instance, if a countable group $\gamma$ acts on ${\mathbb t}^n$ and the action is $c^1$ orbit equivalent to the standard action of $sl_n({\mathbb z})$ on ${\mathbb t}^n$, then $\gamma$ is isomorphic to $sl_n({\mathbb z})$ and the actions are isomorphic. (the same result holds if we replace $sl_n(\mathbb z)$ by a finite index subgroup.) we also show that preserving a geometric structure is an invariant of smooth orbit equivalence and give an application of our ideas to the theory of hyperbolic groups. in the course of proving our theorems, we generalize a theorem of sierpinski which says that a connected hausdorff compact topological space is not the disjoint union of countably many closed sets. we prove a stronger statement that allows ""small"" intersections provided the space is locally connected. this implies that for any continuous action of a countable group $\g$ on a connected, locally connected, locally compact, hausdorff topological space, where the fixed set of every element is ""small"", every orbit equivalence is equivariant."
