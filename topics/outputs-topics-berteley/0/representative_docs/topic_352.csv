"spontaneous gait synchronisation in the wild: exploring the effect of distance and level of interaction. gait synchronization in pedestrians is influenced by biomechanical, environmental, and cognitive factors. studying gait in ecological settings provides insights often missed in controlled experiments. this study tackles the challenges of assessing gait coordination in real-world interactions using a dataset of uninstructed pedestrian trajectories recorded in an underground pedestrian street network. the data are annotated for group relations, interaction levels, and physical contact. the main goals of our study is to devise a method to identify gait synchronisation from trajectory data and to provide an in-depth analysis of social factors affecting gait synchronisation in pedestrian groups. to that end, we first propose a method to extract gait residuals from pedestrian trajectories, which capture motion of the body caused by gait-induced oscillations. we thereafter apply a suite of analytical techniques spanning both frequency and nonlinear domains. frequency-based methods, including the gait synchronisation index and cross wavelet coherence, quantify the alignment of oscillatory patterns in gait. complementary nonlinear measures, such as lyapunov exponents, determinism, and recurrence quantification metrics, offer deeper insights into the dynamical stability and predictability of coupled gaits. results show that higher social interaction and closer distances enhance gait synchronization, reducing stride frequency variation and increasing stability. additionally, triad formation and relative positioning are shown to influence synchronisation. overall, our findings suggest that social interactions shape pedestrian gait coordination, with interaction level and distance being key factors."
"ctrgan: cycle transformers gan for gait transfer. we introduce a novel approach for gait transfer from unconstrained videos in-the-wild. in contrast to motion transfer, the objective here is not to imitate the source's motions by the target, but rather to replace the walking source with the target, while transferring the target's typical gait. our approach can be trained only once with multiple sources and is able to transfer the gait of the target from unseen sources, eliminating the need for retraining for each new source independently. furthermore, we propose a novel metrics for gait transfer based on gait recognition models that enable to quantify the quality of the transferred gait, and show that existing techniques yield a discrepancy that can be easily detected. we introduce cycle transformers gan (ctrgan), that consist of a decoder and encoder, both transformers, where the attention is on the temporal domain between complete images rather than the spatial domain between patches. using a widely-used gait recognition dataset, we demonstrate that our approach is capable of producing over an order of magnitude more realistic personalized gaits than existing methods, even when used with sources that were not available during training. as part of our solution, we present a detector that determines whether a video is real or generated by our model."
"the functional gait deviation index. a typical gait analysis requires the examination of the motion of nine joint angles on the left-hand side and six joint angles on the right-hand side across multiple subjects. due to the quantity and complexity of the data, it is useful to calculate the amount by which a subject's gait deviates from an average normal profile and to represent this deviation as a single number. such a measure can quantify the overall severity of a condition affecting walking, monitor progress, or evaluate the outcome of an intervention prescribed to improve the gait pattern. the gait deviation index, gait profile score, and the overall abnormality measure are standard benchmarks for quantifying gait abnormality. however, these indices do not account for the intrinsic smoothness of the gait movement at each joint/plane and the potential co-variation between the joints/planes. utilizing a multivariate functional principal components analysis we propose the functional gait deviation index (fgdi). fgdi accounts for the intrinsic smoothness of the gait movement at each joint/plane and the potential co-variation between the joints. we show that fgdi scales with overall gait function, provides a consistent measure of gait abnormality, and is implemented easily using an interactive web app."
