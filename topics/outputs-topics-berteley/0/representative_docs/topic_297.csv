"a medium sized schwarzschild-couder cherenkov telescope mechanical design proposed for the cherenkov telescope array. the cherenkov telescope array (cta) is an international next-generation ground-based gamma-ray observatory. cta will be implemented as southern and northern hemisphere arrays of tens of small, medium and large-sized imaging cherenkov telescopes with the goal of improving the sensitivity over the current-generation experiments by an order of magnitude. cta will provide energy coverage from ~20 gev to more than 300 tev. the schwarzschild-couder (sc) medium size (9.5m) telescopes will feature a novel aplanatic two-mirror optical design capable of accommodating a wide field-of-view with significantly improved angular resolution as compared to the traditional davies-cotton optical design. a full-scale prototype sc medium size telescope structure has been designed and will be constructed at the fred lawrence whipple observatory in southern arizona during the fall of 2015. concentrate on the novel features of the design."
"muon tagging on the backend-electronics of chec-s -- a compact high-energy camera for the cherenkov telescope array. the cherenkov telescope array (cta) will be the leading ground-base observatory for very high energy (vhe) {\gamma}-ray astronomy for the next decades. its southern site will host about 70 small sized telescopes (ssts) which will determine the cta sensitivity at {\gamma}-ray energies between 1 and 300 tev. one of the design options for the sst cameras is the silicon photomultiplier-based compact high-energy camera (chec-s). the back-end electronics (bee) of chec-s interconnects the camera front-end modules, provides power and clock distribution, aggregation, routing and time stamping of data and most importantly it implements the camera trigger system. a novel technique to tag muons using the capabilities of this system has been developed, studying and comparing different algorithms such as circle fitting, machine learning and simple pixel counting. this contribution describes the design of the chec-s bee, and presents the results of the performance of this muon tagger and the prospects of using it for other cherenkov telescopes types of cta."
"the next generation cherenkov telescope array observatory: cta. the cherenkov telescope array (cta) is a large collaborative effort aimed at the design and operation of an observatory dedicated to the vhe gamma-ray astrophysics in the energy range 30 gev-100 tev, which will improve by about one order of magnitude the sensitivity with respect to the current major arrays (h.e.s.s., magic, and veritas). in order to achieve such improved performance, for both the northern and southern cta sites, four units of 23m diameter large size telescopes (lsts) will be deployed close to the centre of the array with telescopes separated by about 100m. a larger number (about 25 units) of 12m medium size telescopes (msts, separated by about 150m), will cover a larger area. the southern site will also include up to 24 schwarzschild-couder dual-mirror medium-size telescopes (scts) with the primary mirror diameter of 9.5m. above a few tev, the cherenkov light intensity is such that showers can be detected even well outside the light pool by telescopes significantly smaller than the msts. to achieve the required sensitivity at high energies, a huge area on the ground needs to be covered by small size telescopes (ssts) with a fov of about 10 deg and an angular resolution of about 0.2 deg, making the dual-mirror configuration very effective. the sst sub-array will be composed of 50-70 telescopes with a mirror area of about 5-10 square meters and about 300m spacing, distributed across an area of about 10 square kilometers. we will focus on the innovative solution for the optical design of the medium and small size telescopes based on a dual-mirror configuration. this layout will allow us to reduce the dimension and the weight of the camera at the focal plane of the telescope, to adopt sipms as light detectors thanks to the reduced plate-scale, and to have an optimal imaging resolution on a wide fov."
