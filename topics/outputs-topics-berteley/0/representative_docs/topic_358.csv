"characteristic distributions of finite-time lyapunov exponents. we study the probability densities of finite-time or \local lyapunov exponents (lles) in low-dimensional chaotic systems. while the multifractal formalism describes how these densities behave in the asymptotic or long-time limit, there are significant finite-size corrections which are coordinate dependent. depending on the nature of the dynamical state, the distribution of local lyapunov exponents has a characteristic shape. for intermittent dynamics, and at crises, dynamical correlations lead to distributions with stretched exponential tails, while for fully-developed chaos the probability density has a cusp. exact results are presented for the logistic map, $x \to 4x(1-x)$. at intermittency the density is markedly asymmetric, while for `typical' chaos, it is known that the central limit theorem obtains and a gaussian density results. local analysis provides information on the variation of predictability on dynamical attractors. these densities, which are used to characterize the {\sl nonuniform} spatial organization on chaotic attractors are robust to noise and can therefore be measured from experimental data."
"different routes to chaos via strange nonchaotic attractor in a quasiperiodically forced system. this paper focusses attention on the strange nonchaotic attractors (sna) of a quasiperiodically forced dynamical system. several routes, including the standard ones by which the appearance of strange nonchaotic attractors takes place, are shown to be realizable in the same model over a two parameters ($f-\epsilon$) domain of the system. in particular, the transition through torus doubling to chaos via sna, torus breaking to chaos via sna and period doubling bifurcations of fractal torus are demonstrated with the aid of the two parameter ($f-\epsilon$) phase diagram. more interestingly, in order to approach the strange nonchaotic attractor, the existence of several new bifurcations on the torus corresponding to the novel phenomenon of torus bubbling are described. particularly, we point out the new routes to chaos, namely, (1) two frequency quasiperiodicity $\to$ torus doubling $\to$ torus merging followed by the gradual fractalization of torus to chaos, (2) two frequency quasiperiodicity $\to$ torus doubling $\to$ wrinkling $\to$ sna $\to$ chaos $\to$ sna $\to$ wrinkling $\to$ inverse torus doubling $\to$ torus $\to$ torus bubbles followed by the onset of torus breaking to chaos via sna or followed by the onset of torus doubling route to chaos via sna. the existence of the strange nonchaotic attractor is confirmed by calculating several characterizing quantities such as lyapunov exponents, winding numbers, power spectral measures and dimensions. the mechanism behind the various bifurcations are also briefly discussed."
"bifurcations and transitions in the quasiperiodically driven logistic map. we discuss several bifurcation phenomena that occur in the quasiperiodically driven logistic map. this system can have strange nonchaotic attractors (snas) in addition to chaotic and regular attractors; on snas the dynamics is aperiodic, but the largest lyapunov exponent is nonpositive. there are a number of different transitions that occur here, from periodic attractors to snas, from snas to chaotic attractors, etc. we describe some of these transitions by examining the behavior of the largest lyapunov exponent, distributions of finite time lyapunov exponents and the invariant densities in the phase space."
