"weak convergence of topological measures. topological measures and deficient topological measures are defined on open and closed subsets of a topological space, generalize regular borel measures, and correspond to (non-linear in general) functionals that are linear on singly generated subalgebras or singly generated cones of functions. they lack subadditivity, and many standard techniques of measure theory and functional analysis do not apply to them. nevertheless, we show that many classical results of probability theory hold for topological and deficient topological measures. in particular, we prove a version of aleksandrov's theorem for equivalent definitions of weak convergence of deficient topological measures. we also prove a version of prokhorov's theorem which relates the existence of a weakly convergent subsequence in any sequence in a family of topological measures to the characteristics of being a uniformly bounded in variation and uniformly tight family. we define prokhorov and kantorovich-rubenstein metrics and show that convergence in either of them implies weak convergence of (deficient) topological measures on metric spaces. we also generalize many known results about various dense and nowhere dense subsets of deficient topological measures. the present paper constitutes a first step to further research in probability theory and its applications in the context of topological measures and corresponding non-linear functionals."
"on the projections of the multifractal packing dimension for q>1. the aim of this article is to study the behaviour of the multifractal packing function $b_\mu(q)$ under projections in euclidean space for $q>1$. we show that $b_\mu(q)$ is preserved under almost every orthogonal projection. as an application, we study the multifractal analysis of the projections of a measure. in particular, we obtain general results for the multifractal analysis of the orthogonal projections on $m$-dimensional linear subspaces of a measure $\mu$ satisfying the multifractal formalism."
"a multifractal decomposition for self-similar measures with exact overlaps. we study self-similar measures in $\mathbb{r}$ satisfying the weak separation condition along with weak technical assumptions which are satisfied in all known examples. for such a measure $\mu$, we show that there is a finite set of concave functions $\{\tau_1,\ldots,\tau_m\}$ such that the $l^q$-spectrum of $\mu$ is given by $\min\{\tau_1,\ldots,\tau_m\}$ and the multifractal spectrum of $\mu$ is given by $\max\{\tau_1^*,\ldots,\tau_m^*\}$, where $\tau_i^*$ denotes the concave conjugate of $\tau_i$. in particular, the measure $\mu$ satisfies the multifractal formalism if and only if its multifractal spectrum is a concave function. this implies that $\mu$ satisfies the multifractal formalism at values corresponding to points of differentiability of the $l^q$-spectrum. we also verify existence of the limit for the $l^q$-spectra of such measures for every $q\in\mathbb{r}$. as a direct application, we obtain many new results and simple proofs of well-known results in the multifractal analysis of self-similar measures satisfying the weak separation condition."
