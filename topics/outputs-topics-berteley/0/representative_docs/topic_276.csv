"planck 2013 results. xvii. gravitational lensing by large-scale structure. on the arcminute angular scales probed by planck, the cmb anisotropies are gently perturbed by gravitational lensing. here we present a detailed study of this effect, detecting lensing independently in the 100, 143, and 217ghz frequency bands with an overall significance of greater than 25sigma. we use the temperature-gradient correlations induced by lensing to reconstruct a (noisy) map of the cmb lensing potential, which provides an integrated measure of the mass distribution back to the cmb last-scattering surface. our lensing potential map is significantly correlated with other tracers of mass, a fact which we demonstrate using several representative tracers of large-scale structure. we estimate the power spectrum of the lensing potential, finding generally good agreement with expectations from the best-fitting lcdm model for the planck temperature power spectrum, showing that this measurement at z=1100 correctly predicts the properties of the lower-redshift, later-time structures which source the lensing potential. when combined with the temperature power spectrum, our measurement provides degeneracy-breaking power for parameter constraints; it improves cmb-alone constraints on curvature by a factor of two and also partly breaks the degeneracy between the amplitude of the primordial perturbation power spectrum and the optical depth to reionization, allowing a measurement of the optical depth to reionization which is independent of large-scale polarization data. discarding scale information, our measurement corresponds to a 4% constraint on the amplitude of the lensing potential power spectrum, or a 2% constraint on the rms amplitude of matter fluctuations at z~2."
"scale at scale: cosmological applications of small-scale cmb lensing. the small-correlated-against-large estimator (scale) for small-scale lensing of the cosmic microwave background (cmb) provides a novel method for measuring the amplitude of cmb lensing power without the need for reconstruction of the lensing field. in our previous study, we showed that the scale method can outperform existing reconstruction methods to detect the presence of lensing at small scales ($\ell \gg 3000$). here we develop a procedure to include information from scale in cosmological parameter inference. we construct a precise neural network emulator to quickly map cosmological parameters to desired cmb observables such as temperature and lensing power spectra and scale cross spectra. we also outline a method to apply scale to full-sky maps of the cmb temperature field, and construct a likelihood for the application of scale in parameter estimation. scale supplements conventional observables such as the cmb power spectra and baryon acoustic oscillations in constraining parameters that are sensitive to the small-scale lensing amplitude such as the neutrino mass $m_\nu$. we show that including estimates of the small-scale lensing amplitude from scale in such an analysis provides enough constraining information to measure the minimum neutrino mass at $4\sigma$ significance in the scenario of minimal mass, and higher significance for higher mass. finally, we show that scale will play a powerful role in constraining models of clustering that generate scale-dependent modulation to the distribution of matter and the lensing power spectrum, as predicted by models of warm or fuzzy dark matter."
"a bias to cmb lensing measurements from the bispectrum of large-scale structure. the rapidly improving precision of measurements of gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave background (cmb) also requires a corresponding increase in the precision of theoretical modeling. a commonly made approximation is to model the cmb deflection angle or lensing potential as a gaussian random field. in this paper, however, we analytically quantify the influence of the non-gaussianity of large-scale structure lenses, arising from nonlinear structure formation, on cmb lensing measurements. in particular, evaluating the impact of the non-zero bispectrum of large-scale structure on the relevant cmb four-point correlation functions, we find that there is a bias to estimates of the cmb lensing power spectrum. for temperature-based lensing reconstruction with cmb stage-iii and stage-iv experiments, we find that this lensing power spectrum bias is negative and is of order one percent of the signal. this corresponds to a shift of multiple standard deviations for these upcoming experiments. we caution, however, that our numerical calculation only evaluates two of the largest bias terms and thus only provides an approximate estimate of the full bias. we conclude that further investigation into lensing biases from nonlinear structure formation is required and that these biases should be accounted for in future lensing analyses."
