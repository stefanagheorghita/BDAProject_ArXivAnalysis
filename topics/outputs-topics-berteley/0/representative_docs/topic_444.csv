"active magnetoelectric control of terahertz spin current. electrical control of photogenerated thz spin current pulses from a spintronic emitter has been at the forefront for the development of scalable, cost-efficient, wideband opto-spintronics devices. artificially combined ferroelectric and ferromagnet heterostructure provides the potential avenue to control the spin dynamics efficiently utilizing the magnetoelectric coupling. the demonstration of the electric field control of spin dynamics has so far been limited up to gigahertz frequencies. here, we demonstrate the electric field mediated piezoelectric strain control of photogenerated thz spin current pulse from a multiferroic spintronic emitter. the phase reversal of the thz spin current pulse is obtained from the combined effect of piezoelectric strain and a small constant magnetic field applied opposite to the initial magnetization of the ferromagnet. the piezoelectric strain-controlled phase switching of thz spin current thus opens a door to develop efficient strain engineered scalable on-chip thz spintronics devices."
"picosecond spin orbit torque switching. reducing energy dissipation while increasing speed in computation and memory is a long-standing challenge for spintronics research. in the last 20 years, femtosecond lasers have emerged as a tool to control the magnetization in specific magnetic materials at the picosecond timescale. however, the use of ultrafast optics in integrated circuits and memories would require a major paradigm shift. an ultrafast electrical control of the magnetization is far preferable for integrated systems. here we demonstrate reliable and deterministic control of the out-of-plane magnetization of a 1 nm-thick co layer with single 6 ps-wide electrical pulses that induce spin-orbit torques on the magnetization. we can monitor the ultrafast magnetization dynamics due to the spin-orbit torques on sub-picosecond timescales, thus far accessible only by numerical simulations. due to the short duration of our pulses, we enter a counter-intuitive regime of switching where heat dissipation assists the reversal. moreover, we estimate a low energy cost to switch the magnetization, projecting to below 1fj for a (20 nm)^3 cell. these experiments prove that spintronic phenomena can be exploited on picosecond time-scales for full magnetic control and should launch a new regime of ultrafast spin torque studies and applications."
"emission of coherent thz magnons in an antiferromagnetic insulator triggered by ultrafast spin-phonon interactions. antiferromagnetic materials have been proposed as new types of narrowband thz spintronic devices owing to their ultrafast spin dynamics. manipulating coherently their spin dynamics, however, remains a key challenge that is envisioned to be accomplished by spin-orbit torques or direct optical excitations. here, we demonstrate the combined generation of broadband thz (incoherent) magnons and narrowband (coherent) magnons at 1 thz in low damping thin films of nio/pt. we evidence, experimentally and through modelling, two excitation processes of magnetization dynamics in nio, an off-resonant instantaneous optical spin torque and a strain-wave-induced thz torque induced by ultrafast pt excitation. both phenomena lead to the emission of a thz signal through the inverse spin hall effect in the adjacent heavy metal layer. we unravel the characteristic timescales of the two excitation processes found to be < 50 fs and > 300 fs, respectively, and thus open new routes towards the development of fast opto-spintronic devices based on antiferromagnetic materials."
