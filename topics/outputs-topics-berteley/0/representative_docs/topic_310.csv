"aspects of the bulk flat space limit in ads/cft. the flat space limit of scalar bulk fields in ads is discussed within a lorentzian canonical quantization setup tailored to describe ads state preparation and to extract the flat s-matrix dynamics. we discuss how the algebraic \`{i}n\""on\""u-wigner contraction captures the local physics of the equivalence principle in quantum field theory in a fixed background description. we develop the embedding formalism to describe the bulk ads scalar primary wave functions as holomorphic functions. flat space massive particle states are built out of the ads primary together with ads boosted wave functions. we compute their inner products and show that these become orthogonal in the flat limit, resulting in the correct continuous spectrum for a standard unitary representation of the lorentz group. in this same limit the original ads descendants become null states. we also argue how the flat space s-matrix emerges from standard perturbation theory in the interaction picture. to obtain flat space massless particles requires to consider a double scaled limit in which the boost rapidity is scaled to infinity keeping the average particle energy in the flat space limit fixed. we comment on how this limit generates interesting massless state wave functions with non-trivial shape profiles that remember the dimension of the ads operator. we discuss some of the puzzles attached to these."
"cft adapted gauge invariant formulation of massive arbitrary spin fields in ads. using poincare parametrization of ads space, we study massive totally symmetric arbitrary spin fields in ads space of dimension greater than or equal to four. cft adapted gauge invariant formulation for such fields is developed. gauge symmetries are realized by using stueckelberg formulation of massive fields. we demonstrate that the mass parameter, curvature and radial coordinate contributions to the gauge transformation and lagrangian of the ads massive fields can be expressed in terms of ladder operators. three representations for the lagrangian are discussed. realization of the global ads symmetries in the conformal algebra basis is obtained. modified de donder gauge leading to simple gauge fixed lagrangian is found. the modified de donder gauge leads to decoupled equations of motion which can easily be solved in terms of the bessel function. new simple representation for gauge invariant lagrangian of massive (a)ds field in arbitrary coordinates is obtained. light-cone gauge lagrangian of massive ads field is also presented."
"hidden conformal symmetry of the discrete series scalars in ds$_2$. in $d$ dimensional de sitter space, a scalar field has an infinite tower of special tachyonic mass values at which enhanced shift symmetries appear. after modding out by these shift symmetries, these fields correspond to the unitary irreducible representations of the de sitter group known as the discrete series. we show that in $d=2$ these theories have global conformal symmetry. in all but the massless case, these theories have no stress tensor and the conformal symmetry does not act in the usual way on the scalar field. we find the conformal symmetry by explicitly computing the correlators of the shift invariant local operators and showing that they take conformally invariant forms. we also demonstrate how these fields are self dual in $d=2$, and dual to the shift invariant massive vector fields, which are therefore also conformally invariant."
