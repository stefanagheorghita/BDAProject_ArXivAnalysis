"from trees to loops and back. we argue that generic one-loop scattering amplitudes in supersymmetric yang-mills theories can be computed equivalently with mhv diagrams or with feynman diagrams. we first present a general proof of the covariance of one-loop non-mhv amplitudes obtained from mhv diagrams. this proof relies only on the local character in minkowski space of mhv vertices and on an application of the feynman tree theorem. we then show that the discontinuities of one-loop scattering amplitudes computed with mhv diagrams are precisely the same as those computed with standard methods. furthermore, we analyse collinear limits and soft limits of generic non-mhv amplitudes in supersymmetric yang-mills theories with one-loop mhv diagrams. in particular, we find a simple explicit derivation of the universal one-loop splitting functions in supersymmetric yang-mills theories to all orders in the dimensional regularisation parameter, which is in complete agreement with known results. finally, we present concrete and illustrative applications of feynman's tree theorem to one-loop mhv diagrams as well as to one-loop feynman diagrams."
"notes on the scattering amplitude / wilson loop duality. we consider the duality between the four-dimensional s-matrix of planar maximally supersymmetric yang-mills theory and the expectation value of polygonal shaped wilson loops in the same theory. we extend the duality to amplitudes with arbitrary helicity states by introducing a suitable supersymmetric extension of the wilson loop. we show that this object is determined by a host of recursion relations, which are valid at tree level and at loop level for a certain ""loop integrand"" defined within the lagrangian insertion procedure. these recursion relations reproduce the bcfw ones obeyed by tree-level scattering amplitudes, as well as their extension to loop integrands which appeared recently in the literature, establishing the duality to all orders in perturbation theory. finally, we propose that a certain set of finite correlation functions can be used to compute all first derivatives of the logarithm of mhv amplitudes."
"mhv amplitudes in n=4 super yang-mills and wilson loops. it is a remarkable fact that mhv amplitudes in maximally supersymmetric yang-mills theory at arbitrary loop order can be written as the product of the tree amplitude with the same helicity configuration and a universal, helicity-blind function of the kinematic invariants. in this note we show how for one-loop mhv amplitudes with an arbitrary number of external legs this universal function can be derived using wilson loops. our result is in precise agreement with the known expression for the infinite sequence of mhv amplitudes in n=4 super yang-mills. in the four-point case, we are able to reproduce the expression of the amplitude to all orders in the dimensional regularisation parameter epsilon. this prescription disentangles cleanly infrared divergences and finite terms, and leads to an intriguing one-to-one mapping between certain wilson loop diagrams and (finite) two-mass easy box functions."
