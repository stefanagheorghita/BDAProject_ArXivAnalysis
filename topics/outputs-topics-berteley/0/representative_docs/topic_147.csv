"the origin of planetary impactors in the inner solar system. new insights into the history of the inner solar system are derived from the impact cratering record of the moon, mars, venus and mercury, and from the size distributions of asteroid populations. old craters from a unique period of heavy bombardment that ended $\sim$3.8 billion years ago were made by asteroids that were dynamically ejected from the main asteroid belt, possibly due to the orbital migration of the giant planets. the impactors of the past $\sim$3.8 billion years have a size distribution quite different from the main belt asteroids, but very similar to the population of near-earth asteroids."
"colors of dynamically associated asteroid pairs. recent dynamical studies have identified pairs of asteroids that reside in nearly identical heliocentric orbits. possible formation scenarios for these systems include dissociation of binary asteroids, collisional disruption of a single parent body, or spin-up and rotational fission of a rubble-pile. aside from detailed dynamical analyses and measurement of rotational light curves, little work has been done to investigate the colors or spectra of these unusual objects. a photometric and spectroscopic survey was conducted to determine the reflectance properties of asteroid pairs. new observations were obtained for a total of 34 individual asteroids. additional photometric measurements were retrieved from the sloan digital sky survey moving object catalog. colors or spectra for a total of 42 pair components are presented here. the main findings of this work are: (1) the components in the observed pair systems have the same colors within the uncertainties of this survey, and (2) the color distribution of asteroid pairs appears indistinguishable from that of all main belt asteroids. these findings support a scenario of pair formation from a common progenitor and suggest that pair formation is likely a compositionally independent process. in agreement with previous studies, this is most consistent with an origin via binary disruption and/or rotational fission."
"time and phase resolved optical spectra of potentially hazardous asteroid 2014 jo25. the asteroid 2014 jo25, considered to be ""potentially hazardous"" by the minor planet center, was spectroscopically followed during its close-earth encounter on 19th and 20th of april 2017. the spectra of the asteroid were taken with the low resolution spectrograph (lisa), mounted on the 1.2-m telescope at the mount abu infrared observatory, india. coming from a region close to the hungaria population of asteroids, this asteroid follows a comet-like orbit with a relatively high inclination and large eccentricity. hence, we carried out optical spectroscopic observations of the asteroid to look for comet-like molecular emissions or outbursts. however, the asteroid showed a featureless spectrum, devoid of any comet-like features. the asteroid's light curve was analyzed using v band magnitudes derived from the spectra and the most likely solution for the rotation of the asteroid was obtained. the absolute magnitude $h$ and the slope parameter $g$ were determined for the asteroid in v filter band using the iau accepted standard two parameter h-g model. a peculiar, rarely found result from these observations is its phase bluing trend. the relative b-v color index seems to decrease with increasing phase angle, which indicates a phase bluing trend. such trends have seldom been reported in literature. however, phase reddening in asteroids is very common. the asymmetry parameter $g$ and the single scattering albedo $w$ were estimated for the asteroid by fitting the hapke phase function to the observed data. the asteroid shows relatively large value for the single scattering albedo and a highly back scattering surface."
