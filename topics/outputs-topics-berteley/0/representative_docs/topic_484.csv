"fuse-traffic: fusion of unstructured and structured data for event-aware traffic forecasting. accurate traffic forecasting is a core technology for building intelligent transportation systems (its), enabling better urban resource allocation and improved travel experiences. with growing urbanization, traffic congestion has intensified, highlighting the need for reliable and responsive forecasting models. in recent years, deep learning, particularly graph neural networks (gnns), has emerged as the mainstream paradigm in traffic forecasting. gnns can effectively capture complex spatial dependencies in road network topology and dynamic temporal evolution patterns in traffic flow data. foundational models such as stgcn and graphwavenet, along with more recent developments including stwave and d2stgnn, have achieved impressive performance on standard traffic datasets. these approaches incorporate sophisticated graph convolutional structures and temporal modeling mechanisms, demonstrating particular effectiveness in capturing and forecasting traffic patterns characterized by periodic regularities. to address this challenge, researchers have explored various ways to incorporate event information. early attempts primarily relied on manually engineered event features. for instance, some approaches introduced manually defined incident effect scores or constructed specific subgraphs for different event-induced traffic conditions. while these methods somewhat enhance responsiveness to specific events, their core drawback lies in a heavy reliance on domain experts' prior knowledge, making generalization to diverse and complex unknown events difficult, and low-dimensional manual features often lead to the loss of rich semantic details."
"graph neural network for traffic forecasting: a survey. traffic forecasting is important for the success of intelligent transportation systems. deep learning models, including convolution neural networks and recurrent neural networks, have been extensively applied in traffic forecasting problems to model spatial and temporal dependencies. in recent years, to model the graph structures in transportation systems as well as contextual information, graph neural networks have been introduced and have achieved state-of-the-art performance in a series of traffic forecasting problems. in this survey, we review the rapidly growing body of research using different graph neural networks, e.g. graph convolutional and graph attention networks, in various traffic forecasting problems, e.g. road traffic flow and speed forecasting, passenger flow forecasting in urban rail transit systems, and demand forecasting in ride-hailing platforms. we also present a comprehensive list of open data and source resources for each problem and identify future research directions. to the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first comprehensive survey that explores the application of graph neural networks for traffic forecasting problems. we have also created a public github repository where the latest papers, open data, and source resources will be updated."
"embedding spatial context in urban traffic forecasting with contrastive pre-training. urban traffic forecasting is a commonly encountered problem, with wide-ranging applications in fields such as urban planning, civil engineering and transport. in this paper, we study the enhancement of traffic forecasting with pre-training, focusing on spatio-temporal graph methods. while various machine learning methods to solve traffic forecasting problems have been explored and extensively studied, there is a gap of a more contextual approach: studying how relevant non-traffic data can improve prediction performance on traffic forecasting problems. we call this data spatial context. we introduce a novel method of combining road and traffic information through the notion of a traffic quotient graph, a quotient graph formed from road geometry and traffic sensors. we also define a way to encode this relationship in the form of a geometric encoder, pre-trained using contrastive learning methods and enhanced with openstreetmap data. we introduce and discuss ways to integrate this geometric encoder with existing graph neural network (gnn)-based traffic forecasting models, using a contrastive pre-training paradigm. we demonstrate the potential for this hybrid model to improve generalisation and performance with zero additional traffic data. code for this paper is available at https://github.com/mattchrlw/forecasting-on-new-roads."
