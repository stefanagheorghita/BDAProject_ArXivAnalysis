"multiple changepoint detection with partial information on changepoint times. this paper proposes a new minimum description length procedure to detect multiple changepoints in time series data when some times are a priori thought more likely to be changepoints. this scenario arises with temperature time series homogenization pursuits, our focus here. our bayesian procedure constructs a natural prior distribution for the situation, and is shown to estimate the changepoint locations consistently, with an optimal convergence rate. our methods substantially improve changepoint detection power when prior information is available. the methods are also tailored to bivariate data, allowing changes to occur in one or both component series."
"consistent detection and estimation of multiple structural changes in functional data: unsupervised and supervised approaches. we develop algorithms for detecting multiple changepoints in functional data when the number of changepoints is unknown (unsupervised case), when it is specified apriori (supervised case), and when certain bounds are available (semi-supervised case). these algorithms utilize the maximum mean discrepancy (mmd) measure between distributions on hilbert spaces. we develop an oracle analysis of the changepoint detection problem which reveals an interesting relationship between the true changepoint locations and the local maxima of the oracle mmd curve. the proposed algorithms are shown to detect general distributional changes by exploiting this connection. in the unsupervised case, we test the significance of a potential changepoint and establish its consistency under the single changepoint setting. we investigate the strong consistency of the changepoint estimators in both single and multiple changepoint settings. in both supervised and semi-supervised scenarios, we include a step to merge consecutive groups that are similar to appropriately utilize the prior information about the number of changepoints. in the supervised scenario, the algorithm satisfies an order-preserving property: the estimated changepoints are contained in the true set of changepoints in the underspecified case, while they contain the true set under overspecification. we evaluate the performance of the algorithms on a variety of datasets demonstrating the superiority of the proposed algorithms compared to some of the existing methods."
"post-detection inference for sequential changepoint localization. this paper addresses a fundamental but largely unexplored challenge in sequential changepoint analysis: conducting inference following a detected change. we develop a very general framework to construct confidence sets for the unknown changepoint using only the data observed up to a data-dependent stopping time at which an arbitrary sequential detection algorithm declares a change. our framework is nonparametric, making no assumption on the composite post-change class, the observation space, or the sequential detection procedure used, and is non-asymptotically valid. we also extend it to handle composite pre-change classes under a suitable assumption, and also derive confidence sets for the change magnitude in parametric settings. we provide theoretical guarantees on the width of our confidence intervals. extensive simulations demonstrate that the produced sets have reasonable size, and slightly conservative coverage. in summary, we present the first general method for sequential changepoint localization, which is theoretically sound and broadly applicable in practice."
