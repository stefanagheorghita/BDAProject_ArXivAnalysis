"two-fluid instability of dust and gas in the dust layer of a protoplanetary disk. instabilities of the dust layer in a protoplanetary disk are investigated. it is known that the streaming instability develops and dust density concentration occurs in a situation where the initial dust density is uniform. this work considers the effect of initial dust density gradient vertical to the midplane. dust and gas are treated as different fluids. pressure of dust fluid is assumed to be zero. the gas friction time is assumed to be constant. axisymmetric two-dimensional numerical simulation was performed using the spectral method. we found that an instability develops with a growth rate on the order of the keplerian angular velocity even if the gas friction time multiplied by the keplerian angular velocity is as small as 0.001. this instability is powered by two sources: (1) the vertical shear of the azimuthal velocity, and (2) the relative motion of dust and gas coupled with the dust density fluctuation due to advection. this instability diffuses dust by turbulent advection and the maximum dust density decreases. this means that the dust concentration by the streaming instability which is seen in the case of a uniform initial dust density becomes ineffective as dust density gradient increases by the dust settling toward the midplane."
"stabilization of the shear instability in a dust layer of a protoplanetary disk and possible formation of planetesimals due to gravitational fragmentation of the dust layer. we show that the planetesimal formation due to the gravitational fragmentation of a dust layer in a protoplanetary disk is possible. the dust density distribution in the dust layer would approach the constant richardson number distribution due to the dust stirring by the shear instability and dust settling. we perform the analysis of the shear instability of dust layer in a protoplanetary disk with the constant richardson number density distribution. our study revealed that this distribution is stable against the shear instability even if the dust density at the midplane reaches the critical density of the gravitational instability, and the planetesimal formation through the gravitational fragmentation of the dust layer can occur even for the dust to gas surface density ratio with the solar composition."
"analysis of the instability due to gas-dust friction in protoplanetary discs. we study stability of a dust layer in a gaseous disc subject to the linear axisymmetric perturbations. instead of considering single-size particles, however, the population of dust particles is assumed to consist of two grain species. dust grains exchange momentum with the gas via the drag force and their self-gravity is also considered. we show that the presence of two grain sizes can increase the efficiency of the linear growth of drag-driven instability in the protoplanetary discs. a second dust phase with a small mass, comparing to the first dust phase, would reduce the growth timescale even by a factor of two or more especially when its coupling to the gas is weak. it means that once a certain amount of large dust particles form, even though it is much smaller than that of small dust particles, the dust layer becomes more unstable and dust clumping are accelerated. thus, presence of dust particles with various sizes must be considered in studies of dust clumping in protoplanetary discs where both large and small dust grains are present."
