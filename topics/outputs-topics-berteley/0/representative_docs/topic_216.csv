"the q-deformed harmonic oscillator, coherent states, and the uncertainty relation. for a q-deformed harmonic oscillator, we find explicit coordinate representations of the creation and annihilation operators, eigenfunctions, and coherent states (the last being defined as eigenstates of the annihilation operator). we calculate the product of the coordinate momentum uncertainties in qoscillator eigenstates and in coherent states. for the oscillator, this product is minimum in the ground state and equals 1/2, as in the standard quantum mechanics. for coherent states, the $q$-deformation results in a violation of the standard uncertainty relation; the product of the coordinate- and momentumoperator uncertainties is always less than 1/2. states with the minimum uncertainty, which tends to zero, correspond to the values of $\lambda$ near the convergence radius of the $q$-exponential."
"completeness and nonclassicality of coherent states for generalized oscillator algebras. the purposes of this work are (1) to show that the appropriate generalizations of the oscillator algebra permit the construction of a wide set of nonlinear coherent states in unified form; and (2) to clarify the likely contradiction between the nonclassical properties of such nonlinear coherent states and the possibility of finding a classical analog for them since they are p-represented by a delta function. in (1) we prove that a class of nonlinear coherent states can be constructed to satisfy a closure relation that is expressed uniquely in terms of the meijer g-function. this property automatically defines the delta distribution as the p-representation of such states. then, in principle, there must be a classical analog for them. among other examples, we construct a family of nonlinear coherent states for a representation of the su(1,1) lie algebra that is realized as a deformation of the oscillator algebra. in (2), we use a beam splitter to show that the nonlinear coherent states exhibit properties like anti-bunching that prohibit a classical description for them. we also show that these states lack second order coherence. that is, although the p-representation of the nonlinear coherent states is a delta function, they are not full coherent. therefore, the systems associated with the generalized oscillator algebras cannot be considered `classical' in the context of the quantum theory of optical coherence."
coherent and trajectory-coherent states of a damped harmonic oscillator. in this paper we construct the coherent and trajectory-coherent states of a damped harmonic oscillator. we investigate the properties of this states.
