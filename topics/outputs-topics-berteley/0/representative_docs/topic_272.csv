"relicada -- reservoir computing using linear cellular automata design algorithm. in this paper, we present a novel algorithm to optimize the design of reservoir computing using cellular automata models for time series applications. besides selecting the models' hyperparameters, the proposed algorithm particularly solves the open problem of linear cellular automaton rule selection. the selection method pre-selects only a few promising candidate rules out of an exponentially growing rule space. when applied to relevant benchmark datasets, the selected rules achieve low errors, with the best rules being among the top 5% of the overall rule space. the algorithm was developed based on mathematical analysis of linear cellular automaton properties and is backed by almost one million experiments, adding up to a computational runtime of nearly one year. comparisons to other state-of-the-art time series models show that the proposed reservoir computing using cellular automata models have lower computational complexity, at the same time, achieve lower errors. hence, our approach reduces the time needed for training and hyperparameter optimization by up to several orders of magnitude."
"a game of primes. the basis for most of the ideas mentioned in this paper is the theory of cellular automata. a cellular automata contains a regular grid of cells, with each cell having a pre-defined set of finite states. the initial state is determined at time/state zero. at this point all the cells are assigned their respective starting states. the automata is defined by a set of simple rules that decide the subsequent states of the cells. we aim to create a cellular automata of prime numbers and come up with some axioms, theorems and conjectures for the same."
"cellular automata as a network topology. cellular automata represent physical systems where both space and time are discrete, and the associated physical quantities assume a limited set of values. while previous research has applied cellular automata in modeling chemical, biological, and physical systems, its potential for modeling topological systems, specifically network topologies, remains underexplored. this paper investigates the use of cellular automata to model decentralized network topologies, which could enhance load balancing, fault tolerance, scalability, and the propagation and dissemination of information in distributed systems."
