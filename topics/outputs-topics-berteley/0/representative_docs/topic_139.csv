"carbon nanotubes in electric and magnetic fields. we derive an effective low-energy theory for metallic (armchair and non-armchair) single-wall nanotubes in the presence of an electric field perpendicular to the nanotube axis, and in the presence of magnetic fields, taking into account spin-orbit interactions and screening effects on the basis of a microscopic tight binding model. the interplay between electric field and spin-orbit interaction allows us to tune armchair nanotubes into a helical conductor in both dirac valleys. metallic non-armchair nanotubes are gapped by the surface curvature, yet helical conduction modes can be restored in one of the valleys by a magnetic field along the nanotube axis. furthermore, we discuss electric dipole spin resonance in carbon nanotubes, and find that the rabi frequency shows a pronounced dependence on the momentum along the nanotube."
generation and amplification of terahertz radiation in carbon nanotubes. we investigate theoretically the feasibility of generation and amplification of terahertz radiation in aligned achiral carbon nanotubes (zigzag and armchair) in comparison with a superlattice in the presence of a constant (dc) and high-frequency (ac) electric fields. the electric current density expression is derived using the semiclassical boltzmann transport equation with a constant relaxation time with the electric field applied along the nanotube axis. our analysis on the current density versus electric field characteristics demonstrates negative differential conductivity at high frequency as well as photon assisted peaks. the characteristic peaks are about an order of magnitude styronger in the carbon nanotubes compared to superlattice. these strong phenomena in carbon nanotubes can be used to obtain domainless amplification of terahertz radiation in carbon nanotubes at room temperature.
"the optical excitation of zigzag carbon nanotubes with photons guided in nanofibers. we consider the excitation of electrons in semiconducting carbon nanotubes by photons from the evanescent field created by a subwavelength-diameter optical fiber. the strongly changing evanescent field of such nanofibers requires dropping the dipole approximation. we show that this leads to novel effects, especially a high dependence of the photon absorption on the relative orientation and geometry of the nanotube-nanofiber setup in the optical and near infrared domain. in particular, we calculate photon absorption probabilities for a straight nanotube and nanofiber depending on their relative angle. nanotubes orthogonal to the fiber are found to perform much better than parallel nanotubes when they are short. as the nanotube gets longer the absorption of parallel nanotubes is found to exceed the orthogonal nanotubes and approach 100% for extremely long nanotubes. in addition, we show that if the nanotube is wrapped around the fiber in an appropriate way the absorption is enhanced. we find that optical and near infrared photons could be converted to excitations with efficiencies that may exceed 90%. this may provide opportunities for future photodetectors and we discuss possible setups."
