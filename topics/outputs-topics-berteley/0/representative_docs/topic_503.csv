"possible indication for non-zero neutrino mass and additional neutrino species from cosmological observations. the constraints on total neutrino mass and effective number of neutrino species based on cmb anisotropy power spectrum, hubble constant, baryon acoustic oscillations and galaxy cluster mass function data are presented. it is shown that the discrepancies between various cosmological data in hubble constant and density fluctuation amplitude, measured in standard lcdm cosmological model, can be eliminated if more than standard effective number of neutrino species and non-zero total neutrino mass are considered. this extension of lcdm model appears to be \approx 3 \sigma\ significant when all cosmological data are used. the model with approximately one additional neutrino type, n_eff \approx 4, and with non-zero total neutrino mass, \approx 0.5 ev, provide the best fit to the data. in the model with only one massive neutrino the upper limits on neutrino mass are slightly relaxed. it is shown that these deviations from lcdm model appear mainly due to the usage of recent data on the observations of baryon acoustic oscillations. larger than standard number of neutrino species is measured mainly due to the comparison of the bao data with direct measurements of hubble constant, which was already noticed earlier. as it is shown below, the data on galaxy cluster mass function in this case give the measurement of non-zero neutrino mass."
"gamma ray bursts as probes of neutrino mass, quantum gravity and dark energy. we calculate the time delays of neutrinos emitted in gamma ray bursts due to the effects of neutrino mass and quantum gravity using a time dependent hubble constant which can significantly change the naive results presented hitherto in the literature for large redshifts, and gives some sensitivity to the details of dark energy. we show that the effects of neutrino mass, quantum gravity and dark energy may be disentangled by using low energy neutrinos to study neutrino mass, high energy neutrinos to study quantum gravity, and large redshifts to study dark energy. from low energy neutrinos one may obtain direct limits on neutrino masses of order 10^{-3} ev, and distinguish a neutrino mass hierarchy from an inverted mass hierarchy. from ultra-high energy neutrinos the sensitivity to the scale of quantum gravity can be pushed up to e_{qg} ~ 5 times 10^{30} gev. by studying neutrinos from grbs at large redshifts a cosmological constant could be distinguished from quintessence."
"neutrino cosmology and planck. relic neutrinos play an important role in the evolution of the universe, modifying some of the cosmological observables. we summarize the main aspects of cosmological neutrinos and describe how the precision of present cosmological data can be used to learn about neutrino properties. in particular, we discuss how cosmology provides information on the absolute scale of neutrino masses, complementary to beta decay and neutrinoless double-beta decay experiments. we explain why the combination of planck temperature data with measurements of the baryon acoustic oscillation angular scale provides a strong bound on the sum of neutrino masses, 0.23 ev at the 95% confidence level, while the lensing potential spectrum and the cluster mass function measured by planck are compatible with larger values. we also review the constraints from current data on other neutrino properties. finally, we describe the very good perspectives from future cosmological measurements, which are expected to be sensitive to neutrino masses close the minimum values guaranteed by flavour oscillations."
