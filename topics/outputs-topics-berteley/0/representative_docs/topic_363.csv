"radiative cooling in relativistic collisionless shocks. can simulations and experiments probe relevant grb physics?. we address the question of whether numerical particle-in-cell (pic) simulations and laboratory laser-plasma experiments can (or will be able to, in the near future) model realistic gamma-ray burst (grb) shocks. for this, we compare the radiative cooling time, t_cool, of relativistic electrons in the shock magnetic fields to the microscopic dynamical time of collisionless relativistic shocks -- the inverse plasma frequency of protons, omega_pp^{-1}. we obtain that for t_cool*omega_pp^{-1}\lesssim ~few hundred, the electrons cool efficiently at or near the shock jump and are capable of emitiing away a large fraction of the shock energy. such shocks are well-resolved in existing pic simulations; therefore, the microscopic structure can be studied in detail. since most of the emission in such shocks would be coming from the vicinity of the shock, the spectral power of the emitted radiation can be directly obtained from finite-length simulations and compared with observational data. such radiative shocks correspond to the internal baryon-dominated grb shocks for the conventional range of ejecta parameters. fermi acceleration of electrons in such shocks is limited by electron cooling, hence the emitted spectrum should be lacking a non-thermal tail, whereas its peak likely falls in the multi-mev range. incidentally, the conditions in internal shocks are almost identical to those in laser-produced plasmas; thus, such grb-like plasmas can be created and studied in laboratory experiments using the presently available petawatt-scale laser facilities. an analysis of the external shocks shows that only the highly relativistic shocks, corresponding to the extremely early afterglow phase, can have efficient electron cooling in the shock transition. we emphasize the importance of radiative pic simulations for further studies."
"cosmic ray acceleration at parallel relativistic shocks in the presence of finite-amplitude magnetic field perturbations. we study the first-order fermi acceleration process at parallel shock waves by means of monte carlo simulations. a 'realistic' model of the magnetic field turbulence is applied involving sinusoidal waves imposed on the background mean field parallel to the shock normal. the finite-amplitude magnetic field perturbations lead to locally oblique field configurations at the shock and the respective magnetic field compression. it results in modification of the particle acceleration process introducing some features observed in oblique shocks, e.g. particle reflections from the shock. for the parallel mildly relativistic shocks we demonstrate for the first time a (non-monotonic) variation of the accelerated particle spectral index with the turbulence amplitude."
"diffusive shock acceleration in relativistic, oblique shocks. cosmic rays are charged particles that are accelerated to relativistic speeds by astrophysical shocks. numerical models have been successful in confirming the acceleration process for (quasi-)parallel shocks, which have the magnetic field aligned with the direction of the shock motion. however, the process is less clear when it comes to (quasi-)perpendicular shocks, where the field makes a large angle with the shock-normal. for such shocks, the angle between the magnetic field and flow ensures that only highly energetic particles can travel upstream at all, reducing the upstream current. this process is further inhibited for relativistic shocks, since the shock can become superluminal when the required particle velocity exceeds the speed of light, effectively inhibiting any upstream particle flow. in order to determine whether such shocks can accelerate particles, we use the particle-in-cell (pic) method to determine what fraction of particles gets reflected initially at the shock. we then use this as input for a new simulation that combines the pic method with grid-based magnetohydrodynamics to follow the acceleration (if any) of the particles over a larger time-period in a two-dimensional grid. we find that quasi-perpendicular, relativistic shocks are capable of accelerating particles through the dsa process, provided that the shock has a sufficiently high alfvenic mach number."
