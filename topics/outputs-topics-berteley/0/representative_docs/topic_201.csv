"voter and majority dynamics with biased and stubborn agents. we study binary opinion dynamics in a fully connected network of interacting agents. the agents are assumed to interact according to one of the following rules: (1) voter rule: an updating agent simply copies the opinion of another randomly sampled agent; (2) majority rule: an updating agent samples multiple agents and adopts the majority opinion in the selected group. we focus on the scenario where the agents are biased towards one of the opinions called the {\em preferred opinion}. using suitably constructed branching processes, we show that under both rules the mean time to reach consensus is $\theta(\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of agents in the network. furthermore, under the majority rule model, we show that consensus can be achieved on the preferred opinion with high probability even if it is initially the opinion of the minority. we also study the majority rule model when stubborn agents with fixed opinions are present. we find that the stationary distribution of opinions in the network in the large system limit using mean field techniques."
"stochastic bounded confidence opinion dynamics: how far apart do opinions drift?. in this era of fast and large-scale opinion formation, a mathematical understanding of opinion evolution, a.k.a. opinion dynamics, is especially important. linear graph-based dynamics and bounded confidence dynamics are the two most popular models for opinion dynamics in social networks. recently, stochastic bounded confidence opinion dynamics were proposed as a general framework that incorporates both these dynamics as special cases and also captures the inherent stochasticity and noise (errors) in real-life social exchanges. although these dynamics are quite general and realistic, their analysis is particularly challenging compared to other opinion dynamics models. this is because these dynamics are nonlinear and stochastic, and belong to the class of markov processes that have asymptotically zero drift and unbounded jumps. the asymptotic behavior of these dynamics was characterized in prior works. however, they do not shed light on their finite-time behavior, which is often of interest in practice. we take a stride in this direction by analyzing the finite time behavior of a two-agent system, which is fundamental to the understanding of multi-agent dynamics. in particular, we show that the opinion difference between the two agents is well concentrated around zero under the conditions that lead to asymptotic stability of the dynamics."
"opinion dynamics on biased dynamical networks: beyond rare opinion updating. opinion dynamics is of paramount importance as it provides insights into the complex dynamics of opinion propagation and social relationship adjustment. it is assumed in most of the previous works that social relationships evolve much faster than opinions. this is not always true in reality. we propose an analytical approximation to study this issue for arbitrary time scales between opinion adjustment and network evolution. to this end, the coefficient of determination in statistics is introduced and a one-dimensional stable manifold is analytically found, i.e., the most likely trajectory. with the aid of the stable manifold, we further obtain the fate of opinions and the consensus time, i.e., fixation probability and fixation time. we find that for in-group bias, the more likely individuals are to adopt the popular opinion, the less likely the majority opinion takes over the population, i.e., conformity inhibits the domination of popular opinions. this counter-intuitive result can be interpreted from a game perspective, in which in-group bias refers to a coordination game and rewiring probability refers to a rescaling of the selection intensity. our work proposes an efficient approximation method to foster the understanding of opinion dynamics in dynamical networks."
