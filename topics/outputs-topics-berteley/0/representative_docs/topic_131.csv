"casimir forces on atoms in optical cavities. casimir-type forces, such as those between two neutral conducting plates, or between a sphere, atom or molecule and a plate have been widely studied and are becoming of increasing significance, for example, in nanotechnology. a key challenge is to better understand, from a fundamental microscopic approach, why the casimir force is in some circumstances attractive and in others repulsive. here, we study the casimir-polder forces experienced by small quantum systems such as atoms or molecules in an optical cavity. in order to make the problem more tractable, we work in a 1+1 dimensional setting, we take into account only the ground state and first excited state of the atom and we model the electromagnetic field as a scalar field with dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions. this allows us to determine the conditions for the casimir force to be attractive or repulsive for individual atoms, namely through the interplay of paramagnetic and diamagnetic vacuum effects. we also study the microscopic-macroscopic transition, finding that as the number of atoms in the cavity is increased, the atoms start to affect the casimir force exerted on the cavity walls similarly to a dielectric medium."
"finite temperature casimir effect for scalar field with robin boundary conditions in spacetime with extra dimensions. in this article, we study the finite temperature casimir effect for scalar field with robin boundary conditions on two parallel plates in a background spacetime that has a compact internal manifold with arbitrary geometry. the finite temperature casimir force acting on the plates is derived using the piston approach, with which we show that the divergences of the casimir forces from the region between the plates and the region outside the plates cancel each other. the nature and asymptotic behaviors of the casimir force at different limits such as small and large plate separation, low and high temperature, are studied in detail. the range of robin coefficients where the casimir force are always attractive or always repulsive are determined. there are also some range of the robin coefficients where the casimir force is shown to be attractive at small plate separation and repulsive at large plate separation, or vise versa."
"the casimir effect and geometric optics. we propose a new approach to the casimir effect based on classical ray optics. we define and compute the contribution of classical optical paths to the casimir force between rigid bodies. we reproduce the standard result for parallel plates and agree over a wide range of parameters with a recent numerical treatment of the sphere and plate with dirichlet boundary conditions. our approach improves upon proximity force approximation. it can be generalized easily to other geometries, other boundary conditions, to the computation of casimir energy densities and to many other situations."
