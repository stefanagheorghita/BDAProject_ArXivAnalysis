"trapped-ion quantum logic gates based on oscillating magnetic fields. oscillating magnetic fields and field gradients can be used to implement single-qubit rotations and entangling multi-qubit quantum gates for trapped-ion quantum information processing (qip). with fields generated by currents in microfabricated surface-electrode traps, it should be possible to achieve gate speeds that are comparable to those of optically induced gates for realistic distances between the ion crystal and the electrode surface. magnetic-field-mediated gates have the potential to significantly reduce the overhead in laser beam control and motional state initialization compared to current qip experiments with trapped ions and will eliminate spontaneous scattering, a fundamental source of decoherence in laser-mediated gates."
"quantum computing architecture with rydberg gates in trapped ions. fast entangling gate operations are a fundamental prerequisite for quantum simulation and computation. we propose an entangling scheme for arbitrary pairs of ions in a linear crystal, harnessing the high electric polarizability of highly excited rydberg states. an all-to-all quantum gate connectivity is based on an initialization of a pair of ions to a superposition of ground- and rydberg-states by laser excitation, followed by the entangling gate operation which relies on a state-dependent frequency shift of collective vibrational modes of the crystal. this gate operation requires applying an electric waveform to trap electrodes. employing transverse collective modes of oscillation, we reveal order of $\mu s$ operation times within any of the qubit pairs in a small crystal. in our calculation, we are taking into account realistic experimental conditions and feasible electric field ramps. the proposed gate operation is ready to be combined with a scalable processor architecture to reconfigure the qubit register, either by shuttling ions or by dynamically controlling optical tweezer potentials."
"multi-qubit rydberg gates between distant atoms. we propose an efficient protocol to realize multi-qubit gates in arrays of neutral atoms. the atoms encode qubits in the long-lived hyperfine sublevels of the ground electronic state. to realize the gate, we apply a global laser pulse to transfer the atoms to a rydberg state with strong blockade interaction that suppresses simultaneous excitation of neighboring atoms arranged in a star-graph configuration. the number of rydberg excitations, and thereby the parity of the resulting state, depends on the multiqubit input state. upon changing the sign of the interaction and de-exciting the atoms with an identical laser pulse, the system acquires a geometric phase that depends only on the parity of the excited state, while the dynamical phase is completely canceled. using single qubit rotations, this transformation can be converted to the c$_k$z or c$_k$not quantum gate for $k+1$ atoms. we also present extensions of the scheme to implement quantum gates between distant atomic qubits connected by a quantum bus consisting of a chain of atoms."
