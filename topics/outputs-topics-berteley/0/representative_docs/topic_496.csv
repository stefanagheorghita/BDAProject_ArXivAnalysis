"entanglement reciprocation using three level atoms in a lambda configuration. we propose a scheme in which entanglement can be transferred from atoms (discrete variables) to entangled states of cavity fields (continuous variables). the cavities play the role of a kind of quantum memory for entanglement, in such a way that it is possible to retrieve it back to the atoms. in our method, two three level atoms in a lambda configuration, previously entangled, are set to interact with single mode cavity fields prepared in coherent states. during the process, one e-bit of entanglement may be deposited in the cavities in an efficient way. we also show that the stored entanglement may be transferred back to flying atoms."
"tripartite entanglement transfer from flying modes to localized qubits. we investigate the process of entanglement transfer from a three-mode quantized field to a system of three spatially separated qubits each one made of a two-level atom resonantly coupled to a cavity mode. the optimal conditions for entanglement transfer, evaluated by atomic tripartite negativity, are derived for radiation prepared in qubit-like and gaussian entangled states in terms of field parameters, atom-cavity interaction time, cavity mirror losses, and atomic preparation. for qubit-like states we found that for negligible cavity losses some states may completely transfer their entanglement to the atoms and/or be exactly mapped to the atomic state, whereas for gaussian states we found a range of field parameters to obtain a large entanglement transfer. the purity of the three-qubit states and the entanglement of two-qubit subsystems are also discussed in some details."
"entanglement transfer between bipartite systems. the problem of a controlled transfer of an entanglement initially encoded into two two-level atoms that are successively sent through two single-mode cavities is investigated. the atoms and the cavity modes form a four qubit system and we demonstrate under which conditions the initial entanglement encoded into the atoms can be completely transferred to other pairs of qubits. we find that in the case of a nonzero detuning between the atomic transition frequencies and the cavity mode frequencies, no complete transfer of the initial entanglement is possible to any of the other pairs of qubits. in the case of exact resonance and equal coupling strengths of the atoms to the cavity modes, an initial maximally entangled state of the atoms can be completely transferred to the cavity modes. the complete transfer of the entanglement is restricted to the cavity modes only with the transfer to the other pairs being limited to up to 50%. we have found that the complete transfer of an initial entanglement to other pairs of qubits may take place if the initial state is not the maximally entangled state and the atoms couple to the cavity modes with unequal strengths. depending on the ratio between the coupling strengths, the optimal entanglement can be created between the atoms and one of the cavity modes."
