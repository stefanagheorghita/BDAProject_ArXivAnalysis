"role of van hove singularities and momentum space structure in high-temperature superconductivity. there is a great deal of interest in attributing the high critical temperatures of the cuprates to either the proximity of the fermi level to a van hove singularity or to structure of the superconducting pairing potential in momentum space far from the fermi surface. we examine these ideas by calculating the critical temperature tc for model einstein-phonon- and spin-fluctuation-mediated superconductors within both the standard, fermi-surface-restricted eliashberg theory and the exact mean field theory, which accounts for the full momentum structure of the pairing potential and the energy dependence of the density of states. by using two models of spin-fluctuation-mediated pairing in the cuprates, we demonstrate that our results are independent of the details of the dynamical susceptibility, which is taken to be the pairing potential. we also compare these two models against available neutron scattering data, since these data provide the most direct constraints on the susceptibility. we conclude that the van hove singularity does not drastically alter tc from its value when the density of states is constant and that the effect of momentum structure is significant but secondary in importance to that of the energy dependence in the density of states."
"two-gap model for underdoped cuprate superconductors. various properties of underdoped superconducting cuprates, including the momentum-dependent pseudogap opening, indicate a behavior which is neither bcs nor bose-einstein condensation (bec) like. to explain this issue we introduce a two-gap model. this model assumes an anisotropic pairing interaction among two kinds of fermions with small and large fermi velocities representing the quasiparticles near the m and the nodal points of the fermi surface respectively. we find that a gap forms near the m points resulting into incoherent pairing due to strong fluctuations. instead the pairing near the nodal points sets in with phase coherence at lower temperature. by tuning the momentum-dependent interaction, the model allows for a continuous evolution from a pure bcs pairing (in the overdoped and optimally doped regime) to a mixed boson-fermion picture (in the strongly underdoped regime)."
"electronic structure and properties of superconducting materials with simple fermi surfaces. the electronic structures of the ground state for several different superconducting materials, such as cuprates, conventional 3-dimensional superconductors, doped semiconductors and low-dimensional systems, are quite different and sometimes in contrast to what is supposed to make a superconductor. properties like the fermi-surface (fs) topology, density-of-states (dos), stripes, electron-phonon coupling ($\lambda_{ep}$) and spin fluctuations ($\lambda_{sf}$) are analyzed in order to find clues to what might be important for the mechanism of superconductivity. a high dos at $e_f$ is important for standard estimates of $\lambda's$, but it is suggested that superconductivity can survive a low dos if the fs is simple enough. superconducting fluctuations are plausible from coupling to long wave length modes in underdoped cuprates, where short coherence length is a probable obstacle for long-range superconductivity. thermal disorder is recognized as a limiting factor for large $t_c$ independently of doping."
