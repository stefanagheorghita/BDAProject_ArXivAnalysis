"development of the matrix of primes and proof of an infinite number of primes-twins. this paper is devoted to the theory of prime numbers. in this paper we first introduce the notion of a matrix of prime numbers. then, in order to investigate the density of prime numbers in separate rows of the matrix under consideration, we propose a number of lemmas and theorems that, together with the dirichlet and euler theorems, make it possible to prove the infinity of prime twins."
"on sums of unequal powers of primes and powers of 2. in this paper, it is proved that every sufficiently large even integer can be represented as the sum of two squares of primes, two cubes of primes, two biquadrates of primes and 16 powers of 2. furthermore, there are at least 5.313% odd integers that can be represented as one square of prime, one cube of prime and one biquadrate of prime. this result constitutes a refinement upon that of r. zhang [8]."
"the natural density of some sets of square-free numbers. let $p$ and $t$ be disjoint sets of prime numbers with $t$ finite. a simple formula is given for the natural density of the set of square-free numbers which are divisible by all of the primes in $t$ and by none of the primes in $p$. if $p$ is the set of primes congruent to $r$ modulo $m$ (where $m$ and $r$ are relatively prime numbers), then this natural density is shown to be $0$."
