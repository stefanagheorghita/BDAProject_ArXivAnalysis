"orbit full groups for locally compact groups. we show that the topological rank of an orbit full group generated by an ergodic, probability measure-preserving free action of a non-discrete unimodular locally compact polish group is two. for this, we use the existence of a cross section and show that for a locally compact polish group, the full group generated by any dense subgroup is dense in the orbit full group of the action of the group. we prove that the orbit full group of a free action of a locally compact polish group is extremely amenable if and only if the acting group is amenable, using the fact that the full group generates the von neumann algebra of the action."
"conjugacy, orbit equivalence and classification of measure preserving group actions. we prove that if $g$ is a countable discrete group with property (t) over an infinite subgroup $h<g$ which contains an infinite abelian subgroup or is normal, then $g$ has continuum many orbit inequivalent measure preserving a.e. free ergodic actions on a standard borel probability space. further, we obtain that the measure preserving a.e. free ergodic actions of such a $g$ cannot be classified up to orbit equivalence be a reasonable assignment of countable structures as complete invariants. we also obtain a strengthening and a new proof of a non-classification result of foreman and weiss for conjugacy of measure preserving ergodic, a.e. free actions of discrete countable groups."
"entropy, shannon orbit equivalence, and sparse connectivity. we say that two free probability-measure-preserving actions of countable groups are shannon orbit equivalent if there is an orbit equivalence between them whose associated cocycle partitions have finite shannon entropy. we show that if the acting groups are sofic and each has a w-normal amenable subgroup which is neither locally finite nor virtually cyclic then shannon orbit equivalence implies that the actions have the same maximum sofic entropy. this extends a result of austin beyond the finitely generated amenable setting and has the consequence that two bernoulli actions of a group with the properties in question are shannon orbit equivalent if and only if they are measure conjugate. our arguments apply more generally to actions satisfying a sparse connectivity condition which we call property sc, and yield an entropy inequality under the assumption that one of the actions has this property."
