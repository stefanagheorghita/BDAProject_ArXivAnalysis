"a reram physically unclonable function (reram puf)-based approach to enhance authentication security in software defined wireless networks. the exponentially increasing number of ubiquitous wireless devices connected to the internet in internet of things (iot) networks highlights the need for a new paradigm of data flow management in such large-scale networks under software defined wireless networking (sdwn). the limited power and computation capability available at iot devices as well as the centralized management and decision-making approach in sdwn introduce a whole new set of security threats to the networks. in particular, the authentication mechanism between the controllers and the forwarding devices in sdwns is a key challenge from both secrecy and integrity aspects. conventional authentication protocols based on public key infrastructure (pki) are no longer sufficient for these networks considering the large-scale and heterogeneity nature of the networks as well as their deployment cost, and security vulnerabilities due to key distribution and storage. we propose a novel security protocol based on physical unclonable functions (pufs) known as hardware security primitives to enhance the authentication security in sdwns. in this approach, digital pufs are developed using the inherent randomness of the nanomaterials of resistive random access memory (reram) that are embedded in most iot devices to enable a secure authentication and access control in these networks. these pufs are developed based on a novel approach of multi-states, in which the natural drifts due to the physical variations in the environment are predicted to reduce the potential errors in challenge-response pairs of pufs being tested in different situations. we also proposed a puf-based pki protocol to secure the controller in sdwns. the performance of the developed reram-based pufs are evaluated in the experimental results."
"authentication and hand-over algorithms for iot group. current advancements in mobility of devices and also internet of things (iot) have replaced the central networks by distributed infrastructure. the more a network is distributed, the more the security of infrastructure and the communication is getting complex. the members in a distributed network create different groups according to their coverage area or their requirements. mobility nature of the members brings a problem called hand-over of members between groups. current authentication methods are not applicable due to the lack of resources in the devices.a lightweight authentication method and an easy and fast hand-over process are the current need for the distributed networks. shamir secret sharing algorithm is used for the authentication process in the studies before, but still secure group authentication algorithm and hand-over process are challenges in the group authentication. in this study, a new method is proposed to provide a secure group authentication and hand-over process between groups based on lagrange's interpolation."
"a new advanced user authentication and confidentiality security service. network & internet security is the burning question of today's world and they are deeply related to each other for secure successful data transmission. network security approach is totally based on the concept of network security services. in this paper, a new system of network security service is implemented which is more secure than conventional network security services. this technique is mainly deals with two essential network security services, one is user authentication and other is data confidentiality. for user authentication this paper introduces graphical username & voice password approaches which provides better security than conventional username & password authentication process. in data confidentiality section this paper introduces two layer private key for both message encryption & decryption which is mainly applicable on 8 bit plain text data. this paper also provides the hints of introducing other two network security services (integrity and non-repudiation) as a future work."
