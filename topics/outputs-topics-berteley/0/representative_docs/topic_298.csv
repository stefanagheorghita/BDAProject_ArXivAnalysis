"regular supercuspidal representations. we show that, in good residual characteristic, most supercuspidal representations of a tamely ramified reductive p-adic group g arise from pairs (s,\theta), where s is a tame elliptic maximal torus of g, and \theta is a character of s satisfying a simple root-theoretic property. we then give a new expression for the roots of unity that appear in the adler-debacker-spice character formula for these supercuspidal representations and use it to show that this formula bears a striking resemblance to the character formula for discrete series representations of real reductive groups. led by this, we explicitly construct the local langlands correspondence for these supercuspidal representations and prove stability and endoscopic transfer in the case of toral representations. in large residual characteristic this gives a construction of the local langlands correspondence for almost all supercuspidal representations of reductive p-adic groups."
"local jacquet-langlands correspondence for regular supercuspidal representations. we prove that kaletha's local langlands correspondence for regular supercuspidal representations gives the classical local jacquet--langlands correspondence due to deligne--kazhdan--vigneras and badulescu. as in a former joint paper with oi, where a similar result is proved for the local langlands correspondence for the general linear group, the key ingredients in our proof are the work of bushnell--henniart explicitly describing the local jacquet--langlands correspondence for essentially tame supercuspidal representations and its reinterpretation due to tam in terms of langlands--shelstad's \(\zeta\)-data. while, under suitable assumptions, this result follows from more general theorems either in the recent work of fintzen--kaletha--spice or that of chan--oi, our proof does not require any assumptions. we also complement a few points on the proof in the former paper with oi."
"the local langlands correspondence for simple supercuspidal representations of gl_n(f). let f be a non-archimedean local field of characteristic zero with residual characteristic p. in this paper, we present a simple proof and construction of the local langlands correspondence for simple supercuspidal representations of gl_n(f), when p does not divide n. as an application, we prove jacquet's conjecture on the local converse problem for gl_n(f) in the case of simple supercuspidal representations, for arbitrary p."
