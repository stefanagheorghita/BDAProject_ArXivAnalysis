"modified algebraic bethe ansatz for xxz chain on the segment - i - triangular cases. the modified algebraic bethe ansatz, introduced by cramp\'e and the author [8], is used to characterize the spectral problem of the heisenberg xxz spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ chain on the segment with lower and upper triangular boundaries. the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors are conjectured. they are characterized by a set of bethe roots with cardinality equal to $n$ the length of the chain and which satisfies a set of bethe equations with an additional term. the conjecture follows from exact results for small chains. we also present a factorized formula for the bethe vectors of the heisenberg xxz spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ chain on the segment with two upper triangular boundaries."
boundary perimeter bethe ansatz. we study the partition function of the six-vertex model in the rational limit on arbitrary baxter lattices with reflecting boundary. every such lattice is interpreted as an invariant of the twisted yangian. this identification allows us to relate the partition function of the vertex model to the bethe wave function of an open spin chain. we obtain the partition function in terms of creation operators on a reference state from the algebraic bethe ansatz and as a sum of permutations and reflections from the coordinate bethe ansatz.
"bethe ansatz solution of the open xx spin chain with nondiagonal boundary terms. we consider the integrable open xx quantum spin chain with nondiagonal boundary terms. we derive an exact inversion identity, using which we obtain the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix and the bethe ansatz equations. for generic values of the boundary parameters, the bethe ansatz solution is formulated in terms of jacobian elliptic functions."
