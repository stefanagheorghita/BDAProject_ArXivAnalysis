"modeling kilonova afterglows: effects of the thermal electron population and interaction with grb outflows. given an increasing number of gamma-ray bursts accompanied by potential kilonovae there is a growing importance to advance modelling of kilonova afterglows. in this work, we investigate how the presence of two electron populations that follow a maxwellian (thermal) and a power-law (non-thermal) distributions affect kilonova afterglow light curves. we employ semi-analytic afterglow model, $\texttt{pyblastafterglow}$. we consider kilonova ejecta profiles from ab-initio numerical relativity binary neutron star merger simulations, targeted to gw170817. we do not perform model selection. we find that the emission from thermal electrons dominates at early times. if the interstellar medium density is high (${\simeq}0.1\,\ccm$) it adds an early time peak to the light curve. as ejecta decelerates the spectral and temporal indexes change in a characteristic way that, if observed, can be used to reconstruct the ejecta velocity distribution. for the low interstellar medium density, inferred for grb 170817a, the emission from the non-thermal electron population generally dominates. we also assess how kilonova afterglow light curves change if the interstellar medium has been partially removed and pre-accelerated by laterally expanding gamma-ray burst ejecta. we find that the main effect is the emission suppression at early time ${\lesssim}10^{3}\,$days, and at its maximum it reaches ${\sim}40\%$ when the fast tail of the kilonova ejecta moves subsonically through the wake of laterally spreading gamma-ray burst ejecta. the subsequent rebrightening, when these ejecta break through and shocks form, is very mild (${\lesssim}10\%$), and may not be observable."
"inferring neutron star nuclear properties from gravitational-wave and gamma-ray burst observations. recent discoveries of long gamma-ray bursts accompanied by kilonova emission prompted interest in understanding their progenitors. if these long-duration bursts arise from neutron star mergers, similar to short gamma-ray bursts, it raises the question of which physical properties govern burst duration. the mass of the merger stands out as a key factor, strongly influencing the lifetime of the merger remnant, which in turn determines the burst duration: lighter mergers that form long-lived remnants produce short bursts, whereas more massive mergers result in short-lived remnants that collapse into black holes, powering longer bursts. in this paper, we compare merger rates from gravitational-wave observations of ligo-virgo-kagra with the rates of kilonova-associated long and short gamma-ray bursts, to identify a characteristic total neutron star mass that separates the two burst classes at $1.36^{+0.08}_{-0.09}$ (median and 68\% confidence interval) times of the neutron star tolman-oppenheimer-volkoff mass. this result suggests that massive neutron stars could survive an extended period after merger. our findings are robust against substantial observational uncertainties and model assumptions. moreover, we uncover correlations among various characteristic masses tied to dense nuclear matter, introducing a novel and independent approach to constrain neutron star nuclear properties through separated and combined gravitational-wave and gamma-ray burst observations."
"neutron star mergers as the dominant contributor to the production of heavy $r$-process elements. the discovery of the radioactively powered kilonova at2017gfo, associated with the short-duration gamma-ray burst grb 170817a and the gravitational wave source gw170817, has provided the first direct evidence supporting binary neutron star mergers as crucial astrophysical sites for the synthesis of heavy elements beyond iron through $r$-process nucleosysthesis in the universe. however, recent identifications of kilonovae following long-duration gamma-ray bursts, such as grb 211211a and grb 230307a, has sparked discussions about the potential of neutron star-white dwarf mergers to also produce neutron-rich ejecta and contribute to the production of heavy $r$-process elements. in this work, we estimate the contribution of binary neutron star mergers to the total mass of $r$-process elements in the milky way and investigate the possibility of neutron star-white dwarf mergers as alternative astrophysical sites for $r$-process nucleosynthesis through an analysis of the total mass of the $r$-process elements in the milky way. our results reveal that binary neutron star mergers can sufficiently account for the galactic heavy $r$-process elements, suggesting that these events are the dominant contributor to the production of heavy $r$-process elements in the milky way. considering the total mass of $r$-process elements in the milky way and the higher occurrence rate of neutron star-white dwarf mergers, it is unlikely that such mergers can produce a significant amount of neutron-rich ejecta, with the generated mass of $r$-process elements being lower than $0.005m_{\odot}$."
