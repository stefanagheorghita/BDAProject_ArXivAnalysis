"the pomeron and odderon in elastic, inelastic and total cross sections at the lhc. a simple model for elastic diffractive hadron scattering, reproducing the dip-bump structure is used to analyze pp and $\bar pp$ scattering. the main emphasis is on the delicate and non-trivial dynamics in the dip-bump region, near t=-1 gev$^2$. the simplicity of the model and the expected smallness of the absorption corrections enables one the control of various contributions to the scattering amplitude, in particular the interplay between the c-even and c-odd components of the amplitude, as well as their relative contribution, changing with s and t. the role of the non-linearity of the regge trajectories is scrutinized. the ratio of the real to imaginary parts of the forward amplitude, the ratio of elastic to total cross sections and the inelastic cross section are calculated. predictions for the lhc energy region, where most of the exiting models will be either confirmed or ruled out, are presented."
"total and differential cross sections for the pp-->pp eta-prime reaction near threshold. the eta-prime meson production in the reaction pp-->pp eta-prime has been studied at excess energies of q = 26.5, 32.5 and 46.6 mev using the internal beam facility cosy-11 at the cooler synchrotron cosy. the total cross sections as well as one angular distribution for the highest q-value are presented. the excitation function of the near threshold data can be described by a pure s-wave phase space distribution with the inclusion of the proton-proton final state interaction and coulomb effects. the obtained angular distribution of the eta-prime mesons is also consistent with pure s-wave production."
"proton-proton collisions at production thresholds. recent results obtained by the cosy-11 collaboration concerning the production of eta and eta' mesons in the pp --> pp meson reaction are presented. a comparison of the production amplitude for the pi(0), eta and eta' mesons at the same phase space volume allows to conclude that the proton-eta' interaction is in the order of, or smaller than, the proton-pi(0) one. a total cross section determined in a preliminary analysis of the data of elementary kaon and antikaon production via the pp-->ppk(+)k(-) reaction measured at excess energy of q = 17 mev is reported."
