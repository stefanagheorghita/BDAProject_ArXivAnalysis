"elastic interaction of particles for robotic tactile simulation. tactile sensing plays an important role in robotic perception and manipulation. to overcome the real-world limitations of data collection, simulating tactile response in virtual environment comes as a desire direction of robotic research. most existing works model the tactile sensor as a rigid multi-body, which is incapable of reflecting the elastic property of the tactile sensor as well as characterizing the fine-grained physical interaction between two objects. in this paper, we propose elastic interaction of particles (eip), a novel framework for tactile emulation. at its core, eip models the tactile sensor as a group of coordinated particles, and the elastic theory is applied to regulate the deformation of particles during the contact process. the implementation of eip is conducted from scratch, without resorting to any existing physics engine. experiments to verify the effectiveness of our method have been carried out on two applications: robotic perception with tactile data and 3d geometric reconstruction by tactile-visual fusion. it is possible to open up a new vein for robotic tactile simulation, and contribute to various downstream robotic tasks."
"the role of tactile sensing in learning and deploying grasp refinement algorithms. a long-standing question in robot hand design is how accurate tactile sensing must be. this paper uses simulated tactile signals and the reinforcement learning (rl) framework to study the sensing needs in grasping systems. our first experiment investigates the need for rich tactile sensing in the rewards of rl-based grasp refinement algorithms for multi-fingered robotic hands. we systematically integrate different levels of tactile data into the rewards using analytic grasp stability metrics. we find that combining information on contact positions, normals, and forces in the reward yields the highest average success rates of 95.4% for cuboids, 93.1% for cylinders, and 62.3% for spheres across wrist position errors between 0 and 7 centimeters and rotational errors between 0 and 14 degrees. this contact-based reward outperforms a non-tactile binary-reward baseline by 42.9%. our follow-up experiment shows that when training with tactile-enabled rewards, the use of tactile information in the control policy's state vector is drastically reducible at only a slight performance decrease of at most 6.6% for no tactile sensing in the state. since policies do not require access to the reward signal at test time, our work implies that models trained on tactile-enabled hands are deployable to robotic hands with a smaller sensor suite, potentially reducing cost dramatically."
"tactile robotics: an outlook. robotics research has long sought to give robots the ability to perceive the physical world through touch in an analogous manner to many biological systems. developing such tactile capabilities is important for numerous emerging applications that require robots to co-exist and interact closely with humans. consequently, there has been growing interest in tactile sensing, leading to the development of various technologies, including piezoresistive and piezoelectric sensors, capacitive sensors, magnetic sensors, and optical tactile sensors. these diverse approaches utilise different transduction methods and materials to equip robots with distributed sensing capabilities, enabling more effective physical interactions. these advances have been supported in recent years by simulation tools that generate large-scale tactile datasets to support sensor designs and algorithms to interpret and improve the utility of tactile data. the integration of tactile sensing with other modalities, such as vision, as well as with action strategies for active tactile perception highlights the growing scope of this field. to further the transformative progress in tactile robotics, a holistic approach is essential. in this outlook article, we examine several challenges associated with the current state of the art in tactile robotics and explore potential solutions to inspire innovations across multiple domains, including manufacturing, healthcare, recycling and agriculture."
