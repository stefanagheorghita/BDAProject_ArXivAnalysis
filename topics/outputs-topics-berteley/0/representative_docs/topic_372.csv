"oh+ in astrophysical media: state-to-state formation rates, einstein coefficients and inelastic collision rates with he. the rate constants required to model the oh$^+$ observations in different regions of the interstellar medium have been determined using state of the art quantum methods. first, state-to-state rate constants for the h$_2(v=0,j=0,1)$+ o$^+$($^4s$) $\rightarrow$ h + oh$^+(x ^3\sigma^-, v', n)$ reaction have been obtained using a quantum wave packet method. the calculations have been compared with time-independent results to asses the accuracy of reaction probabilities at collision energies of about 1 mev. the good agreement between the simulations and the existing experimental cross sections in the $0.01-$1 ev energy range shows the quality of the results. the calculated state-to-state rate constants have been fitted to an analytical form. second, the einstein coefficients of oh$^+$ have been obtained for all astronomically significant ro-vibrational bands involving the $x^3\sigma^-$ and/or $a^3\pi$ electronic states. for this purpose the potential energy curves and electric dipole transition moments for seven electronic states of oh$^+$ are calculated with {\it ab initio} methods at the highest level and including spin-orbit terms, and the rovibrational levels have been calculated including the empirical spin-rotation and spin-spin terms. third, the state-to-state rate constants for inelastic collisions between he and oh$^+(x ^3\sigma^-)$ have been calculated using a time-independent close coupling method on a new potential energy surface. all these rates have been implemented in detailed chemical and radiative transfer models. applications of these models to various astronomical sources show that inelastic collisions dominate the excitation of the rotational levels of oh$^+$. in the models considered the excitation resulting from the chemical formation of oh$^+$ increases the line fluxes by about 10 % or less depending on the density of the gas."
"theoretical vibrational-excitation cross sections and rate coefficients for electron-impact resonant collisions involving rovibrationally excited n2 and no molecules. electron-impact vi->vf vibrational excitations cross sections, involving rovibrationally excited n_{2}(v_{i}, j) and no(v_{i}, j) molecules (fixed j), are calculated for collisions occurring through the nitrogen resonant electronic state n_{2}^{-} (x ^{2}\pi_{g}), and the three resonant states of nitric oxide no^{-}(^{3}\sigma^{-},^{1} \delta,^{1} \sigma^{+}). complete sets of cross sections have been obtained for all possible transitions involving 68 vibrational levels of n2(x ^{1}\sigma^{+}_{g}) and 55 levels of no(x ^{2}\pi), for the incident electron energy between 0.1 and 10 ev. in order to study the rotational motion in the resonant processes, cross sections have been also computed for rotationally elastic transitions characterized by the rotational quantum number j running from 0 through 150. the calculations are performed within the framework of the local complex potential model, by using potentials energies and widths optimized in order to reproduce the experimental cross sections available in literature. rate coefficients are calculated for all the (v_{i}, j) \rightarrow (v_{f}, j) transitions by assuming a maxwellian electron energy distribution function in the temperature range from 0.1 ev to 100 ev. all the produced numerical data can be accessed at http://users.ba.cnr.it/imip/cscpal38/phys4entry/database.html."
"near l-edge single and multiple photoionization of singly charged iron ions. absolute cross sections for m-fold photoionization (m=1,...,6) of fe+ by a single photon were measured employing the photon-ion merged-beams setup pipe at the petra iii synchrotron light source, operated by desy in hamburg, germany. photon energies were in the range 680-920 ev which covers the photoionization resonances associated with 2p and 2s excitation to higher atomic shells as well as the thresholds for 2p and 2s ionization. the corresponding resonance positions were measured with an uncertainty of +- 0.2 ev. the cross section for fe+ photoabsorption is derived as the sum of the individually measured cross-sections for m-fold ionization. calculations of the fe+ absorption cross sections have been carried out using two different theoretical approaches, hartree-fock including relativistic extensions and fully relativistic multi-configuration dirac fock. apart from overall energy shifts of up to about 3 ev, the theoretical cross sections are in good agreement with each other and with the experimental results. in addition, the complex deexcitation cascades after the creation of inner-shell holes in the fe+ ion have been tracked on the atomic fine-structure level. the corresponding theoretical results for the product charge-state distributions are in much better agreement with the experimental data than previously published configuration-average results. the present experimental and theoretical results are valuable for opacity calculations and are expected to pave the way to a more accurate determination of the iron abundance in the interstellar medium."
