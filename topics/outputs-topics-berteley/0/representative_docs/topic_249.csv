"renormalization group flow in a general gauge theory. the renormalization group flow in a general renormalizable gauge theory with a simple gauge group in 3+1 dimensions is analyzed. the flow of the ratios of the yukawa couplings and the gauge coupling is described in terms of a bounded potential, which makes it possible to draw a number of non-trivial conclusions concerning the asymptotic structure of the theory. a classification of possible flow patterns is given."
"gradient flow exact renormalization group. the gradient flow bears a close resemblance to the coarse graining, the guiding principle of the renormalization group (rg). in the case of scalar field theory, a precise connection has been made between the gradient flow and the rg flow of the wilson action in the exact renormalization group (erg) formalism. by imitating the structure of this connection, we propose an erg differential equation that preserves manifest gauge invariance in yang--mills theory. our construction in continuum theory can be extended to lattice gauge theory."
wilson's renormalization group and its applications in perturbation theory. the general prescription for constructing the continuum limit of a field theory is explained using wilson's renormalization group. we then formulate the renormalization group in perturbation theory and apply it to the four dimensional phi4 theory and qed.
