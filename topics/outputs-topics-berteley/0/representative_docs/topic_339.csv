"millimeter imaging of mwc 758: probing the disk structure and kinematics. we investigate the structure and kinematics of the circumstellar disk around the herbig ae star mwc 758 using high resolution observations of the 12co (3-2) and dust continuum emission at the wavelengths of 0.87 and 3.3 mm. we find that the dust emission peaks at an orbital radius of about 100 au, while the co intensity has a central peak coincident with the position of the star. the co emission is in agreement with a disk in keplerian rotation around a 2.0 msun star, confirming that mwc758 is indeed an intermediate mass star. by comparing the observation with theoretical disk models, we derive that the disk surface density sigma(r) steeply increases from 40 to 100 au, and decreases exponentially outward. within 40 au, the disk has to be optically thin in the continuum emission at millimeter wavelengths to explain the observed dust morphology, though our observations lack the angular resolution and sensitivity required to constrain the surface density on these spatial scales. the surface density distribution in mwc 758 disk is similar to that of ``transition'' disks, though no disk clearing has been previously inferred from the analysis of the spectral energy distribution (sed). moreover, the asymmetries observed in the dust and co emission suggest that the disk may be gravitationally perturbed by a low mass companion orbiting within a radius of 30 au. our results emphasize that seds alone do not provide a complete picture of disk structure and that high resolution millimeter-wave images are essential to reveal the structure of the cool disk mid plane."
"alma survey of class ii protoplanetary disks in corona australis: a young region with low disk masses. in recent years, the disk populations in a number of young star-forming regions have been surveyed with alma. understanding the disk properties and their correlation with those of the central star is critical to understand planet formation. in particular, a decrease of the average measured disk dust mass with the age of the region has been observed. we conducted high-sensitivity continuum alma observations of 43 class ii young stellar objects in cra at 1.3 mm (230 ghz). the typical spatial resolution is 0.3"". the continuum fluxes are used to estimate the dust masses of the disks, and a survival analysis is performed to estimate the average dust mass. we also obtained new vlt/x-shooter spectra for 12 of the objects in our sample. 24 disks are detected, and stringent limits have been put on the average dust mass of the non-detections. accounting for the upper limits, the average disk mass in cra is $6\pm3\,\rm m_\oplus$, significantly lower than that of disks in other young (1-3 myr) star forming regions (e.g. lupus) and appears consistent with the 5-10 myr old upper sco. the position of the stars in our sample on the hr diagram, however, seems to confirm that that cra has age similar to lupus. neither external photoevaporation nor a lower than usual stellar mass distribution can explain the low disk masses. on the other hand, a low-mass disk population could be explained if the disks are small, which could happen if the parent cloud has a low temperature or intrinsic angular momentum, or if the the angular momentum of the cloud is removed by some physical mechanism such as magnetic braking. in order to fully explain and understand the dust mass distribution of protoplanetary disks and their evolution, it may also be necessary to take into consideration the initial conditions of star and disk formation process, which may vary from region to region, and affect planet formation."
"dual-wavelength alma observations of dust rings in protoplanetary disks. we present new atacama large millimeter/submillimeter array (alma) observations for three protoplanetary disks in taurus at 2.9\,mm and comparisons with previous 1.3\,mm data both at an angular resolution of $\sim0.''1$ (15\,au for the distance of taurus). in the single-ring disk ds tau, double-ring disk go tau, and multiple-ring disk dl tau, the same rings are detected at both wavelengths, with radial locations spanning from 50 to 120\,au. to quantify the dust emission morphology, the observed visibilities are modeled with a parametric prescription for the radial intensity profile. the disk outer radii, taken as 95\% of the total flux encircled in the model intensity profiles, are consistent at both wavelengths for the three disks. dust evolution models show that dust trapping in local pressure maxima in the outer disk could explain the observed patterns. dust rings are mostly unresolved. the marginally resolved ring in ds tau shows a tentatively narrower ring at the longer wavelength, an observational feature expected from efficient dust trapping. the spectral index ($\alpha_{\rm mm}$) increases outward and exhibits local minima that correspond to the peaks of dust rings, indicative of the changes in grain properties across the disks. the low optical depths ($\tau\sim$0.1--0.2 at 2.9\,mm and 0.2--0.4 at 1.3\,mm) in the dust rings suggest that grains in the rings may have grown to millimeter sizes. the ubiquitous dust rings in protoplanetary disks modify the overall dynamics and evolution of dust grains, likely paving the way towards the new generation of planet formation."
