"structure and flow of low-dimensional water. water, a subject of human fascination for millennia, is likely the most studied substance on earth, with an entire scientific field -- hydrodynamics -- dedicated to understanding water in motion. however, when water flows through one-dimensional or two-dimensional channels, its behavior deviates substantially from the principles of hydrodynamics. this is because reducing the dimensionality of any interacting physical system amplifies interaction effects that are beyond the reach of traditional hydrodynamic equations. in low-dimensional water, hydrogen bonds can become stable enough to arrange water molecules into an ordered state, causing water to behave not only like a liquid but also like a solid in certain respects. in this review, we explore the relationship between water's ordering and its ability to flow in low-dimensional channels, using viscosities of bulk water, vapor, and ice as benchmarks. we also provide a brief overview of the key theoretical approaches available for such analyses and discuss ionic transport, which is heavily influenced by the molecular structure of water."
"molecular polarizability of water from the local dielectric response theory. we propose a fully ab initio theory to compute the electron density response under the perturbation in the local field. this method is based on our recently developed local dielectric response theory [phys. rev. b 92, 241107(r), 2015], which provides a rigorous theoretical framework to treat local electronic excitations in extended systems beyond the commonly employed dipole approximation. we have applied this method to study the electronic part of the molecular polarizability of water in ice ih and liquid water. our results reveal that the crystal field of the hydrogen-bond network has strong anisotropic effects, which significantly enhance the out-of-plane component and suppress the in-plane component perpendicular to the bisector direction. the contribution from the charge transfer is equally important, which increases the isotropic molecular polarizability by 5-6%. our study provides new insights into the dielectric properties of water, which form the basis to understand the electronic excitations in water and to develop accurate polarizable force fields of water."
"water's interfacial hydrogen bonding structure reveals the effective strength of surface-water interactions. the interactions of a hydrophilic surface with water can significantly influence the characteristics of the liquid water interface. in this manuscript, we explore this influence by studying the molecular structure of liquid water at a disordered surface with tunable surface-water interactions. we combine all-atom molecular dynamics simulations with a mean field model of interfacial hydrogen bonding to analyze the effect of surface-water interactions on the structural and energetic properties of the liquid water interface. we find that the molecular structure of water at a weakly interacting (i.e., hydrophobic) surface is resistant to change unless the strength of surface-water interactions are above a certain threshold. we find that below this threshold water's interfacial structure is homogeneous and insensitive to the details of the disordered surface, however, above this threshold water's interfacial structure is heterogeneous. despite this heterogeneity, we demonstrate that the equilibrium distribution of molecular orientations can be used to quantify the energetic component of the surface-water interactions that contribute specifically to modifying the interfacial hydrogen bonding network. we identify this specific energetic component as a new measure of hydrophilicity, which we refer to as the intrinsic hydropathy."
