"deep portfolio optimization via distributional prediction of residual factors. recent developments in deep learning techniques have motivated intensive research in machine learning-aided stock trading strategies. however, since the financial market has a highly non-stationary nature hindering the application of typical data-hungry machine learning methods, leveraging financial inductive biases is important to ensure better sample efficiency and robustness. in this study, we propose a novel method of constructing a portfolio based on predicting the distribution of a financial quantity called residual factors, which is known to be generally useful for hedging the risk exposure to common market factors. the key technical ingredients are twofold. first, we introduce a computationally efficient extraction method for the residual information, which can be easily combined with various prediction algorithms. second, we propose a novel neural network architecture that allows us to incorporate widely acknowledged financial inductive biases such as amplitude invariance and time-scale invariance. we demonstrate the efficacy of our method on u.s. and japanese stock market data. through ablation experiments, we also verify that each individual technique contributes to improving the performance of trading strategies. we anticipate our techniques may have wide applications in various financial problems."
"predicting the effects of news sentiments on the stock market. stock market forecasting is very important in the planning of business activities. stock price prediction has attracted many researchers in multiple disciplines including computer science, statistics, economics, finance, and operations research. recent studies have shown that the vast amount of online information in the public domain such as wikipedia usage pattern, news stories from the mainstream media, and social media discussions can have an observable effect on investors opinions towards financial markets. the reliability of the computational models on stock market prediction is important as it is very sensitive to the economy and can directly lead to financial loss. in this paper, we retrieved, extracted, and analyzed the effects of news sentiments on the stock market. our main contributions include the development of a sentiment analysis dictionary for the financial sector, the development of a dictionary-based sentiment analysis model, and the evaluation of the model for gauging the effects of news sentiments on stocks for the pharmaceutical market. using only news sentiments, we achieved a directional accuracy of 70.59% in predicting the trends in short-term stock price movement."
"hisa-smfm: historical and sentiment analysis based stock market forecasting model. one of the pillars to build a country's economy is the stock market. over the years, people are investing in stock markets to earn as much profit as possible from the amount of money that they possess. hence, it is vital to have a prediction model which can accurately predict future stock prices. with the help of machine learning, it is not an impossible task as the various machine learning techniques if modeled properly may be able to provide the best prediction values. this would enable the investors to decide whether to buy, sell or hold the share. the aim of this paper is to predict the future of the financial stocks of a company with improved accuracy. in this paper, we have proposed the use of historical as well as sentiment data to efficiently predict stock prices by applying lstm. it has been found by analyzing the existing research in the area of sentiment analysis that there is a strong correlation between the movement of stock prices and the publication of news articles. therefore, in this paper, we have integrated these factors to predict the stock prices more accurately."
