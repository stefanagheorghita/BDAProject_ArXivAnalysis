"the star cluster - field star connection in nearby spiral galaxies. ii. field star and cluster formation histories and their relation. recent studies have started to cast doubt on the assumption that most stars are formed in clusters. observational studies of field stars and star cluster systems in nearby galaxies can lead to better constraints on the fraction of stars forming in clusters. we aim to constrain the amount of star formation happening in long-lived clusters for four galaxies through the homogeneous study of field stars and star clusters. using hst/acs-wfpc2 images of the galaxies ngc45, ngc1313, ngc5236 and ngc7793, we estimate star formation histories by means of the synthetic cmd method. masses and ages of star clusters are estimated using simple stellar population model fitting. comparing observed and modeled luminosity functions we estimate cluster formation rates. by randomly sampling the stellar imf, we construct artificial star clusters and quantify how stochastic effects influence cluster detection, integrated colors and age estimates. star formation rates appear to be constant over the past 10-100 myr. the number of clusters identified per galaxy varies, with few massive (>10^5msun) and few old (>1gyr) clusters. the galaxies ngc5236 and ngc1313 show high star and cluster formation rates compare to ngc7793 and ngc45. stochastic sampling of the simf has a strong impact on estimation of ages, colors and completeness for clusters with masses <10^4msun, while for high masses the effect is less pronounced. stochasticity also makes size measurements highly uncertain at young ages, making it difficult to distinguish between clusters and stars based on sizes. the ratio of star formation happening in clusters compared to the global star formation ($\gamma$) appears to vary for different galaxies. we find no obvious relation between $\gamma$ and the star formation rate density within the range probed here. the $\gamma$ values do, however, appear to correlate with the specific u-band luminosity (t_l (u))."
"the stellar populations of early-type galaxies -- ii. the effects of environment and mass. the degree of influence that environment and mass have on the stellar populations of early-type galaxies is uncertain. in this paper we present the results of a spectroscopic analysis of the stellar populations of early-type galaxies aimed at addressing this question. the sample of galaxies is drawn from four clusters, with <z>=0.04, and their surrounding structure extending to ~10r_{vir}. we find that the distributions of the absorption-line strengths and the stellar population parameters age, metallicity and alpha-element abundance ratio do not differ significantly between the clusters and their outskirts, but the tight correlations found between these quantities and velocity dispersion within the clusters are weaker in their outskirts. all three stellar population parameters of cluster galaxies are positively correlated with velocity dispersion. galaxies in clusters form a homogeneous class of objects that have similar distributions of line-strengths and stellar population parameters, and follow similar scaling relations regardless of cluster richness or morphology. we estimate the intrinsic scatter of the gaussian distribution of metallicities to be 0.3 dex, while that of the alpha-element abundance ratio is 0.07 dex. the e-folding time of the exponential distribution of galaxy ages is estimated to be 900 myr. the intrinsic scatters of the metallicity and alpha-element abundance ratio distributions can almost entirely be accounted for by the correlations with velocity dispersion and the intrinsic scatter about these relations. this implies that a galaxies mass plays the major role in determining its stellar population."
"effects of environment on stellar metallicity profiles of late-type galaxies in the califa survey. we explore the effects of environment in the evolution of late-type galaxies by studying the radial profiles of light- and mass-weighted metallicities of galaxies in two discrete environments: field and groups. we use a sample of 167 late-type galaxies, with stellar masses $9\le \log(m_{\star}/m_{\odot}) \le 12$, drawn from the califa survey. we make a study of the metallicity of galaxies in these two environments which includes the comparison of the metallicity as a function of the radius, at a characteristic scale, and as a function of a the stellar mass surface density. we find significant differences between group and field late-type galaxies in terms of their metallicity, in the sense that group galaxies are systematically more metallic than their field counterparts. we find that field galaxies have, in general, metallicity profiles that show a negative gradient in their inner regions, and a shallower profile at larger radii. this contrasts with the metallicity profiles of galaxies in groups, which tend to be flat in the inner regions, and to have a negative gradient in the outer parts. regarding the metallicity at the characteristic radius of the luminosity profiles, we consistently find that it is higher for group galaxies irrespective of galaxy mass. at fixed local stellar surface mass density, group galaxies are again more metallic, also the dependence of metallicity on surface density is less important for group galaxies. the evidence of a clear difference on the metallicity of group and field galaxies, as a function of mass, spatial scale, and local stellar mass density, are indicative of the different evolutionary paths that galaxies in groups and in the field have followed. we discuss possible implications of the observed differences."
