dynamic meta learn model time sensitive cold start recommendation present novel dynamic recommendation model focus user interaction past turn relatively inactive recently make effective recommendation time sensitive cold start user critical maintain user base recommender system sparse recent interaction challenge capture user current preference precisely solely rely historical interaction lead outdated recommendation misalign recent interest propose model leverage historical current user item interaction dynamically factorize user latent preference time specific time evolve representation jointly affect user behavior latent factor interact optimize item embed achieve accurate timely recommendation experiment real world datum help demonstrate effectiveness propose time sensitive cold start recommendation model
convolutional gaussian embedding personalized recommendation uncertainty exist embed base recommendation model use embedding vector correspond single fix point low dimensional space represent user item embedding fail precisely represent user item uncertainty observe recommender system address problem propose unified deep recommendation framework employ gaussian embedding prove adaptive uncertain preference exhibit user result well user representation recommendation performance furthermore framework adopt monte carlo sampling convolutional neural network compute correlation objective user candidate item base precise recommendation achieve extensive experiment benchmark dataset justify propose gaussian embedding capture uncertainty user demonstrate superior performance state art recommendation model
