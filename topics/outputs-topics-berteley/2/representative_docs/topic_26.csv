text neural operator image manipulation text instruction recent year text guide image manipulation gain increase attention multimedia computer vision community input conditional image generation evolve image multimodality paper study setting allow user edit image multiple object complex text instruction add remove change object input task multimodal include reference image instruction natural language describe desire modification image propose gan base method tackle problem key idea treat text neural operator locally modify image feature propose model perform favorably recent strong baseline public dataset specifically generate image great fidelity semantic relevance image query lead well retrieval performance
unify vision language task text generation exist method vision language learning typically require design task specific architecture objective task example multi label answer classifier visual question answer region scorer refer expression comprehension language decoder image captioning etc alleviate hassle work propose unified framework learn different task single architecture language modeling objective multimodal conditional text generation model learn generate label text base visual textual input popular vision language benchmark include visual question answer refer expression comprehension visual commonsense reasoning previously model discriminative task generative approach single unified architecture reach comparable performance recent task specific state art vision language model generative approach show well generalization ability question rare answer framework allow multi task learning single architecture single set parameter achieve similar performance separately optimize single task model code publicly available
