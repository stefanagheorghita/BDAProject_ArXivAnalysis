  embeddings",cs.CL,"  Introduction: Tracing the spread of ideas and the presence of influence is a
question of special importance across a wide range of disciplines, ranging from
intellectual history to cultural analytics, computational social science, and
the science of science.
  Method: We collect a corpus of open source journal articles, generate
Knowledge Graph representations using the Gemini LLM, and attempt to predict
the existence of citations between sampled pairs of articles using previously
published methods and a novel Graph Neural Network based embedding model.
  Results: We demonstrate that our knowledge graph embedding method is superior
at distinguishing pairs of articles with and without citation. Once trained, it
runs efficiently and can be fine-tuned on specific corpora to suit individual
researcher needs.
  Conclusion(s): This experiment demonstrates that the relationships encoded in
a knowledge graph, especially the types of concepts brought together by
specific relations can encode information capable of revealing intellectual
influence. This suggests that further work in analyzing document level
knowledge graphs to understand latent structures could provide valuable
insights.

In scientometrics, they are also central to the construction of quantitative indicators. Not all citations, however, serve the same function: some provide background, others introduce methods, or compare results. Therefore, understanding citation intent allows for a more nuanced interpretation of scientific impact. In this paper, we adopted a GAN-based method to classify citation intents. Our results revealed that the proposed method achieves competitive classification performance, closely matching state-of-the-art results with substantially fewer parameters. This demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of leveraging GAN architectures combined with contextual embeddings in intent classification task. We also investigated whether filtering citation intents affects the centrality of papers in citation networks. Analyzing the network constructed from the unArXiv dataset, we found that paper rankings can be significantly influenced by citation intent. All four centrality metrics examined- degree, PageRank, closeness, and betweenness - were sensitive to the filtering of citation types. The betweenness centrality displayed the greatest sensitivity, showing substantial changes in ranking when specific citation intents were removed."
gnn_citations,graph neural networks for citation analysis,5,2104.02562,0.76140594,Structured Citation Trend Prediction Using Graph Neural Networks,cs.LG cs.SI,"  Academic citation graphs represent citation relationships between
publications across the full range of academic fields. Top cited papers
typically reveal future trends in their corresponding domains which is of
importance to both researchers and practitioners. Prior citation prediction
methods often require initial citation trends to be established and do not take
advantage of the recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs). We
present GNN-based architecture that predicts the top set of papers at the time
of publication. For experiments, we curate a set of academic citation graphs
for a variety of conferences and show that the proposed model outperforms other
classic machine learning models in terms of the F1-score.

non-Euclidean data such as social network data and biological data. Despite
their success, the design of graph neural networks requires a lot of manual
work and domain knowledge. In this paper, we propose a Graph Neural
Architecture Search method (GraphNAS for short) that enables automatic search
of the best graph neural architecture based on reinforcement learning.
Specifically, GraphNAS first uses a recurrent network to generate
variable-length strings that describe the architectures of graph neural
networks, and then trains the recurrent network with reinforcement learning to
maximize the expected accuracy of the generated architectures on a validation
data set. Extensive experimental results on node classification tasks in both
transductive and inductive learning settings demonstrate that GraphNAS can
achieve consistently better performance on the Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed citation
network, and protein-protein interaction network. On node classification tasks,
GraphNAS can design a novel network architecture that rivals the best
human-invented architecture in terms of test set accuracy.

  We spotlight how ACL OCL applies to observe trends in computational

reflecting how authors frame their work, and influencing uptake by future
scholars. However, our understanding of citation behavior has been limited to
small-scale manual citation analysis. We perform the largest behavioral study
of citations to date, analyzing how citations are both framed and taken up by
scholars in one entire field: natural language processing. We introduce a new
dataset of nearly 2,000 citations annotated for function and centrality, and
use it to develop a state-of-the-art classifier and label the entire ACL
Reference Corpus. We then study how citations are framed by authors and use
both papers and online traces to track how citations are followed by readers.
We demonstrate that authors are sensitive to discourse structure and
publication venue when citing, that online readers follow temporal links to
previous and future work rather than methodological links, and that how a paper
cites related work is predictive of its citation count. Finally, we use changes
in citation roles to show that the field of NLP is undergoing a significant
increase in consensus.

scholarly works and the space of knowledge. Graph and text embeddings provide a
convenient vector representation of scholarly works based on citations and
text. Yet, it is unclear whether their representations are consistent or
provide different views of the structure of science. Here, we compare graph and
text embedding by testing their ability to capture the hierarchical structure
of the Physics and Astronomy Classification Scheme (PACS) of papers published
by the American Physical Society (APS). We also provide a qualitative
comparison of the overall structure of the graph and text embeddings for
reference. We find that neural network-based methods outperform traditional
methods and graph embedding methods such as node2vec are better than other
methods at capturing the PACS structure. Our results call for further
investigations into how different contexts of scientific papers are captured by
different methods, and how we can combine and leverage such information in an
interpretable manner.

encompassing systematic reviews, node classification, and node clustering. In
PGB, we aggregate the metadata associated with the biomedical articles from

semi-supervised object classification, whereby we propose to train a
fully-connected network jointly with the graph neural network via parameter
sharing and interpolation-based regularization. Further, we provide a
theoretical analysis of how GraphMix improves the generalization bounds of the
underlying graph neural network, without making any assumptions about the

experimentally validate this analysis by applying GraphMix to various
architectures such as Graph Convolutional Networks, Graph Attention Networks
and Graph-U-Net. Despite its simplicity, we demonstrate that GraphMix can
consistently improve or closely match state-of-the-art performance using even
simpler architectures such as Graph Convolutional Networks, across three
established graph benchmarks: Cora, Citeseer and Pubmed citation network
datasets, as well as three newly proposed datasets: Cora-Full, Co-author-CS and

This study introduces CiteFusion, an ensemble framework designed to address the multi-class Citation Intent Classification task on two benchmark datasets: SciCite and ACL-ARC. The framework employs a one-vs-all decomposition of the multi-class task into class-specific binary subtasks, leveraging complementary pairs of SciBERT and XLNet models, independently tuned, for each citation intent. The outputs of these base models are aggregated through a feedforward neural network meta-classifier to reconstruct the original classification task. To enhance interpretability, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is employed to analyze token-level contributions, and interactions among base models, providing transparency into the classification dynamics of CiteFusion, and insights about the kind of misclassifications of the ensemble. In addition, this work investigates the semantic role of structural context by incorporating section titles, as framing devices, into input sentences, assessing their positive impact on classification accuracy. CiteFusion ultimately demonstrates robust performance in imbalanced and data-scarce scenarios: experimental results show that CiteFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, with Macro-F1 scores of 89.60% on SciCite, and 76.24% on ACL-ARC. Furthermore, to ensure interoperability and reusability, citation intents from both datasets schemas are mapped to Citation Typing Ontology (CiTO) object properties, highlighting some overlaps. Finally, we describe and release a web-based application that classifies citation intents leveraging the CiteFusion models developed on SciCite."

  Part I",cs.DL,"  This review summarizes papers which analyze impact of self-citation on
research evaluation. We introduce a generalized definition of self-citation and
its variants: author, institutional, country, journal, discipline, publisher
self-citation. Formulae of the basic self-citation measures are given, namely
self-citing and self-cited rates. World literature on author, institutional,
country and journal self-citation is studied in more detail. Current views on
the role and impact of self-citation are compiled and analyzed. It is found
that there is a general consensus on some points: (a) pathological is as
excessive self-citation so its total absence; (b) self-citation has low impact
on large science units but may be critical for analysis of individual
researchers; (c) share of self-citations is generally higher for units with low
bibliometric performance, while top scientists, institutions, journals receive
the majority of their citations from outside. This review also considers how
bibliometric instruments and databases respond to challenge of possible
manipulation by self-citations and how they correct bibliometric indicators
calculated by them. The first part of the review presented here deals with the
fundamental terms and definitions, and the most discussed and studied type of
the self-citation, author self-citation. The paper was funded by RFBR, project

gnn_citations,graph neural networks for citation analysis,16,2203.12455,0.7464558,Assessing Network Representations for Identifying Interdisciplinarity,cs.DL cs.SI,"  Many studies have sought to identify interdisciplinary research as a function
of the diversity of disciplines identified in an article's references or
citations. However, given the constant evolution of the scientific landscape,
disciplinary boundaries are shifting and blurring, making it increasingly
difficult to describe research within a strict taxonomy. In this work, we
explore the potential for graph learning methods to learn embedded
representations for research papers that encode their 'interdisciplinarity' in
a citation network. This facilitates the identification of interdisciplinary
research without the use of disciplinary categories. We evaluate these
representations and their ability to identify interdisciplinary research,
according to their utility in interdisciplinary citation prediction. We find
that those representations which preserve structural equivalence in the
citation graph are best able to predict distant, interdisciplinary interactions
in the network, according to multiple definitions of citation distance.

gnn_citations,graph neural networks for citation analysis,17,2105.05527,0.74645466,Self-citation Analysis using Sentence Embeddings,cs.DL,"  The purpose of citation indexes and metrics is intended to be a measure for
scientific innovation and quality for researchers, journals, and institutions.
However, those metrics are often prone to abuse and manipulation by excessive
and unethical self-citations induced by authors, reviewers, editors, or
journals. Identifying whether there are or not legitimate reasons for
self-citations is normally determined during the review process, where the
participating parts may have intrinsic incentives, rendering the legitimacy of
self-citations, after publication, questionable. In this paper, we conduct a
large-scale analysis of journal self-citations while taking into consideration
the similarity between a publication and its references. Specifically, we look
into PubMed Central articles published since 1990 and compute similarities of
article-reference pairs using sentence embeddings. We examine journal
self-citations with an aim to distinguish between justifiable and unethical
self-citations.

  network and semantic analysis",cs.DL,"  Citations acknowledge the impact a scientific publication has on subsequent
work. At the same time, deciding how and when to cite a paper, is also heavily
influenced by social factors. In this work, we conduct an empirical analysis
based on a dataset of 2010-2012 global publications in chemical engineering. We
use social network analysis and text mining to measure publication attributes
and understand which variables can better help predicting their future success.
Controlling for intrinsic quality of a publication and for the number of
authors in the byline, we are able to predict scholarly impact of a paper in
terms of citations received six years after publication with almost 80 percent
accuracy. Results suggest that, all other things being equal, it is better to
co-publish with rotating co-authors and write the papers' abstract using more
positive words, and a more complex, thus more informative, language.
Publications that result from the collaboration of different social groups also
attract more citations.

  application to author citation networks",cs.DL cs.SI,"  Understanding the evolution of paper and author citations is of paramount
importance for the design of research policies and evaluation criteria that can
promote and accelerate scientific discoveries. Recently many studies on the
evolution of science have been conducted in the context of the emergent science
of science field. While many studies have probed the link problem in citation
networks, only a few works have analyzed the temporal nature of link prediction
in author citation networks. In this study we compared the performance of 10
well-known local network similarity measurements to predict future links in
author citations networks. Differently from traditional link prediction
methods, the temporal nature of the predict links is relevant for our approach.
Our analysis revealed interesting results. The Jaccard coefficient was found to
be among the most relevant measurements. The preferential attachment
measurement, conversely, displayed the worst performance. We also found that
the extension of local measurements to their weighted version do not
significantly improved the performance of predicting citations. Finally, we
also found that a neural network approach summarizing the information from all
10 considered similarity measurements was not able to provide the highest
prediction performance.

gnn_citations,graph neural networks for citation analysis,20,2004.12275,0.7435628,Citation Cascade and the Evolution of Topic Relevance,cs.SI cs.DL,"  Citation analysis, as a tool for quantitative studies of science, has long
emphasized direct citation relations, leaving indirect or high order citations
overlooked. However, a series of early and recent studies demonstrate the
existence of indirect and continuous citation impact across generations. Adding
to the literature on high order citations, we introduce the concept of a
citation cascade: the constitution of a series of subsequent citing events
initiated by a certain publication. We investigate this citation structure by
analyzing more than 450,000 articles and over 6 million citation relations. We
show that citation impact exists not only within the three generations
documented in prior research, but also in much further generations. Still, our
experimental results indicate that two to four generations are generally
adequate to trace a work's scientific impact. We also explore specific
structural properties such as depth, width, structural virality, and size,
which account for differences among individual citation cascades. Finally, we
find evidence that it is more important for a scientific work to inspire trans
domain (or indirectly related domain) works than to receive only intra domain
recognition in order to achieve high impact. Our methods and findings can serve
as a new tool for scientific evaluation and the modeling of scientific history.

systematically and show that most h-type indices have the dimensions of [P],
where [P] is the basic dimensional unit in bibliometrics which is the unit
publication or paper. The newly introduced Euclidean index, based on the
Euclidean length of the citation vector has the dimensions [P3/2]. An empirical

We investigate multiple citation characteristics, including citation location within the full text, reference and in-text citation types, citation sentiment, and textual and bibliographic relatedness between citing and cited papers. Our findings reveal that as HCPs age, they tend to be cited earlier in papers citing them, mentioned fewer times in the full text, and more often cited alongside other references. Citation sentiment remains predominantly neutral, while both textual and bibliographic similarity between HCPs and their citing papers decline over time. These patterns indicate a shift from direct topical and methodological engagement toward more general, background, and symbolic referencing. The findings highlight the importance to consider citation context rather than relying solely on simple citation counts. Large-scale full-text analyses such as ours can help refine measures of scientific impact and advance scholarly search and science mapping by uncovering more nuanced connections between papers."

benefit a variety of stakeholders including editorial staff, publishers,
indexing services, researchers, university administrators and granting
agencies. Using historical data on journal performance, this can be framed as a
machine learning regression problem. In this work, we study two such regression
tasks: 1) prediction of the number of citations a journal will receive during
the next calendar year, and 2) prediction of the Elsevier CiteScore a journal
will be assigned for the next calendar year. To address these tasks, we first
create a dataset of historical bibliometric data for journals indexed in
Scopus. We propose the use of neural network models trained on our dataset to
predict the future performance of journals. To this end, we perform feature
selection and model configuration for a Multi-Layer Perceptron and a Long
Short-Term Memory. Through experimental comparisons to heuristic prediction
baselines and classical machine learning models, we demonstrate superior
performance in our proposed models for the prediction of future citation and

  split network",physics.soc-ph cs.DL,"  Bibliographic coupling (BC) and co-citation (CC) are the two most common
citation-based coupling measures of similarity between scientific items. One
can interpret these measures as second-neighbor relations distinguished by the
direction of the citation: BC is a similarity between two citing items, whereas
CC is that between two cited items. A previous study proposed a two-layer node
split network that can emulate clusters of coupling measures in a
computationally efficient manner; however, the lack of intralayer links makes
it impossible to obtain exact similarities. Here, we propose novel methods to
estimate intralayer similarity on a node split network using personalized
PageRank and neural embedding. We demonstrate that the proposed measures are
strongly correlated with the coupling measures. Moreover, our proposed method
can yield precise similarities between items even if they are distant from each
other. We also show that many links with high similarity are missing in the
original BC/CC network, which suggests that it is essential to consider
long-range similarities. Comparative experiments on global and local edge
sampling suggest that local sampling is stable for both similarities in node
split networks. This analysis offers valuable insights into the process of
searching for significantly related items regarding each coupling measure.

topological compositions which make samples interrelated came into prominence.
Analogically, those networks can be interpreted as social connections, dataflow
maps, citation influence graphs, protein bindings, etc. However, in the case of
social networks, it is highly crucial to evaluate the labels of discrete
communities. The reason underneath for such a study is the non-negligible
importance of analyzing graph networks to partition the vertices by using the
topological features of network graphs, solely. For each of these
interaction-based entities, a social graph, a mailing dataset, and two citation
sets are selected as the testbench repositories. This paper, it was not only
assessed the most valuable method but also determined how graph neural networks
work and the need to improve against non-neural network approaches which are
faster and computationally cost-effective. Also, this paper showed a limit to
be excesses by prospective graph neural network variations by using the

abstracts and the corresponding citation network that provides a first citation
classification. Relevant keywords are extracted for each article through
text-mining, allowing us to construct a semantic classification. We study the
qualitative patterns of relations between endogenous disciplines within each

their associated interdisciplinarity measures. The tools we develop accordingly
are open and reusable for similar large scale studies of scientific

of citing. Citations are also central to research evaluation, thus creating
incentives for researchers to cite their own work. Using a dataset containing
more than 63 million articles and 51 million disambiguated authors, this paper
examines the relative importance of self-citations and self-references in the
scholarly communication landscape, their relationship with the age and gender
of authors, as well as their effects on various research evaluation indicators.
Results show that self-citations and self-references evolve in different
directions throughout researchers' careers, and that men and older researchers
are more likely to self-cite. Although self-citations have, on average, a small
to moderate effect on author's citation rates, they highly inflate citations
for a subset of researchers. Comparison of the abstracts of cited and citing
papers to assess the relatedness of different types of citations shows that
self-citations are more similar to each other than other types of citations,
and therefore more relevant. However, researchers that self-reference more tend
to include less relevant citations. The paper concludes with a discussion of
the role of self-citations in scholarly communication.

  citation counts?",cs.DL,"  Altmetrics from Altmetric.com are widely used by publishers and researchers
to give earlier evidence of attention than citation counts. This article
assesses whether Altmetric.com scores are reliable early indicators of likely
future impact and whether they may also reflect non-scholarly impacts. A
preliminary factor analysis suggests that the main altmetric indicator of
scholarly impact is Mendeley reader counts, with weaker news, informational and
social network discussion/promotion dimensions in some fields. Based on a
regression analysis of Altmetric.com data from November 2015 and Scopus
citation counts from October 2017 for articles in 30 narrow fields, only
Mendeley reader counts are consistent predictors of future citation impact.
Most other Altmetric.com scores can help predict future impact in some fields.
Overall, the results confirm that early Altmetric.com scores can predict later
citation counts, although less well than journal impact factors, and the
optimal strategy is to consider both Altmetric.com scores and journal impact
factors. Altmetric.com scores can also reflect dimensions of non-scholarly
impact in some fields.

(2008) presenting a narrative review of studies on citations in scientific
documents. The current review covers 41 studies published between 2006 and
2018. Bornmann and Daniel (2008) focused on earlier years. The current review
describes the (new) studies on citation content and context analyses as well as
the studies that explore the citation motivation of scholars through surveys or
interviews. One focus in this paper is on the technical developments in the
last decade, such as the richer meta-data available and machine-readable
formats of scientific papers. These developments have resulted in citation
context analyses of large datasets in comprehensive studies (which was not
possible previously). Many studies in recent years have used computational and
machine learning techniques to determine citation functions and polarities,
some of which have attempted to overcome the methodological weaknesses of
previous studies. The automated recognition of citation functions seems to have
the potential to greatly enhance citation indices and information retrieval
capabilities. Our review of the empirical studies demonstrates that a paper may
be cited for very different scientific and non-scientific reasons. This result
accords with the finding by Bornmann and Daniel (2008). The current review also
shows that to better understand the relationship between citing and cited
documents, a variety of features should be analyzed, primarily the citation
context, the semantics and linguistic patterns in citations, citation locations
within the citing document, and citation polarity (negative, neutral,
positive).

  PubMed related article score",cs.IR,"  In this contribution, we deal with seed-based information retrieval in
networks of research publications. Using systematic reviews as a baseline, and
publication data from the NIH Open Citation Collection, we compare the
performance of the three citation-based approaches direct citation,
co-citation, and bibliographic coupling with respect to recall and precision
measures. In addition, we include the PubMed Related Article score as well as
combined approaches in the comparison. We also provide a fairly comprehensive
review of earlier research in which citation relations have been used for
information retrieval purposes. The results show an advantage for co-citation
over bibliographic coupling and direct citation. However, combining the three
approaches outperforms the exclusive use of co-citation in the study. The
results further indicate, in line with previous research, that combining
citation-based approaches with textual approaches enhances the performance of
seed-based information retrieval. The results from the study may guide
approaches combining citation-based and textual approaches in their choice of
citation similarity measures. We suggest that future research use more
structured approaches to evaluate methods for seed-based retrieval of
publications, including comparative approaches as well as the elaboration of
common data sets and baselines for evaluation.

designed to address problems where pairwise relations between objects are
crucial. Recent advancements utilize graph convolutional neural networks to
extract features within graph structures. Despite promising results, these
methods face challenges in real-world applications due to sparse features,
resulting in inefficient resource utilization. Recent studies draw inspiration
from the mammalian brain and employ spiking neural networks to model and learn
graph structures. However, these approaches are limited to traditional Von
Neumann-based computing systems, which still face hardware inefficiencies. In
this study, we present a fully neuromorphic implementation of spiking graph
neural networks designed for Loihi 2. We optimize network parameters using Lava
Bayesian Optimization, a novel hyperparameter optimization system compatible
with neuromorphic computing architectures. We showcase the performance benefits
of combining neuromorphic Bayesian optimization with our approach for citation
graph classification using fixed-precision spiking neurons. Our results
demonstrate the capability of integer-precision, Loihi 2 compatible spiking
neural networks in performing citation graph classification with comparable
accuracy to existing floating point implementations.

  Processing and Machine Learning Techniques: An overview of empirical studies",cs.DL cs.LG,"  Citation analysis is one of the most frequently used methods in research
evaluation. We are seeing significant growth in citation analysis through
bibliometric metadata, primarily due to the availability of citation databases
such as the Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar, Microsoft Academic, and
Dimensions. Due to better access to full-text publication corpora in recent
years, information scientists have gone far beyond traditional bibliometrics by
tapping into advancements in full-text data processing techniques to measure
the impact of scientific publications in contextual terms. This has led to
technical developments in citation context and content analysis, citation
classifications, citation sentiment analysis, citation summarisation, and
citation-based recommendation. This article aims to narratively review the
studies on these developments. Its primary focus is on publications that have
used natural language processing and machine learning techniques to analyse

gnn_citations,graph neural networks for citation analysis,34,2309.09727,0.7397854,When Large Language Models Meet Citation: A Survey,cs.DL cs.CL,"  Citations in scholarly work serve the essential purpose of acknowledging and
crediting the original sources of knowledge that have been incorporated or
referenced. Depending on their surrounding textual context, these citations are
used for different motivations and purposes. Large Language Models (LLMs) could
be helpful in capturing these fine-grained citation information via the
corresponding textual context, thereby enabling a better understanding towards
the literature. Furthermore, these citations also establish connections among
scientific papers, providing high-quality inter-document relationships and
human-constructed knowledge. Such information could be incorporated into LLMs
pre-training and improve the text representation in LLMs. Therefore, in this
paper, we offer a preliminary review of the mutually beneficial relationship
between LLMs and citation analysis. Specifically, we review the application of
LLMs for in-text citation analysis tasks, including citation classification,
citation-based summarization, and citation recommendation. We then summarize
the research pertinent to leveraging citation linkage knowledge to improve text
representations of LLMs via citation prediction, network structure information,
and inter-document relationship. We finally provide an overview of these
contemporary methods and put forth potential promising avenues in combining
LLMs and citation analysis for further investigation.

it depends on not only the quality of a paper but also various factors, such as
conventionality, team size, and gender. Here, we examine the extent to which
the conventionality of a paper is related to its citation percentile in a
discipline by using our measure, topic disparity. The topic disparity is the
cosine distance between a paper and its discipline on a neural embedding space.
Using this measure, we show that the topic disparity is negatively associated
with the citation percentile in many disciplines, even after controlling team
size and the genders of the first and last authors. This result indicates that
less conventional research tends to receive fewer citations than conventional
research. Our proposed method can be used to complement the raw citation counts
and to recommend papers at the periphery of a discipline because of their less
conventional topics.

networks have been extended to process and learn from data on graphs, with
achievements in tasks like graph signal reconstruction, graph or node
classifications, and link prediction. However, these methods are only suitable
for data defined on the nodes of a graph. In this paper, we propose a
simplicial convolutional neural network (SCNN) architecture to learn from data
defined on simplices, e.g., nodes, edges, triangles, etc. We study the SCNN
permutation and orientation equivariance, complexity, and spectral analysis.
Finally, we test the SCNN performance for imputing citations on a coauthorship

numbers of citations after 3 years. Inclusion of over three diagrams in this
8-page limit conference was found to correlate with a lower citation count.
Focusing on neural network system diagrams, we find a correlation between
highly cited papers and ""good diagramming practice"" quantified by level of

types (one visually based, one mental model based) were not found to correlate
with number of citations, but enabled quantification of heterogeneity in those

can be applied to author citation networks to measure the popularity and
prestige of a scholar from a citation perspective. Information Retrieval (IR)
was selected as a test field and data from 1956-2008 were collected from Web of
Science (WOS). Weighted PageRank with citation and publication as weighted
vectors were calculated on author citation networks. The results indicate that
both popularity rank and prestige rank were highly correlated with the weighted
PageRank. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was conducted to detect
relationships among these different measures. For capturing prize winners
within the IR field, prestige rank outperformed all the other measures.

gnn_citations,graph neural networks for citation analysis,39,2001.05917,0.7373395,Assigning credit to scientific datasets using article citation networks,cs.IR,"  A citation is a well-established mechanism for connecting scientific
artifacts. Citation networks are used by citation analysis for a variety of
reasons, prominently to give credit to scientists' work. However, because of
current citation practices, scientists tend to cite only publications, leaving
out other types of artifacts such as datasets. Datasets then do not get
appropriate credit even though they are increasingly reused and experimented
with. We develop a network flow measure, called DataRank, aimed at solving this
gap. DataRank assigns a relative value to each node in the network based on how
citations flow through the graph, differentiating publication and dataset flow
rates. We evaluate the quality of DataRank by estimating its accuracy at
predicting the usage of real datasets: web visits to GenBank and downloads of
Figshare datasets. We show that DataRank is better at predicting this usage
compared to alternatives while offering additional interpretable outcomes. We
discuss improvements to citation behavior and algorithms to properly track and
assign credit to datasets.

define disciplinary boundaries, to trace the dissemination of knowledge, and to
estimate impact. Co-citation, the frequency with which pairs of publications
are cited, provides insight into how documents relate to each other and across
fields. Co-citation analysis has been used to characterize combinations of
prior work as conventional or innovative and to derive features of highly cited
publications. Given the organization of science into disciplines, a key
question is the sensitivity of such analyses to frame of reference. Our study
examines this question using semantically-themed citation networks. We observe
that trends reported to be true across the scientific literature do not hold
for focused citation networks, and we conclude that inferring novelty using
co-citation analysis and random graph models benefits from disciplinary
context.

articles. It portrays essential information in indicative, supportive, or
contrastive studies. The task of inline citation classification aids in
extrapolating these relationships; However, existing studies are still immature
and demand further scrutiny. Current datasets and methods used for inline
citation classification only use citation-marked sentences constraining the
model to turn a blind eye to domain knowledge and neighboring contextual
sentences. In this paper, we propose a new dataset, named 3Cext, which along
with the cited sentences, provides discourse information using the vicinal
sentences to analyze the contrasting and entailing relationships as well as
domain information. We propose PeriCite, a Transformer-based deep neural
network that fuses peripheral sentences and domain knowledge. Our model
achieves the state-of-the-art on the 3Cext dataset by +0.09 F1 against the best
baseline. We conduct extensive ablations to analyze the efficacy of the
proposed dataset and model fusion methods.

be normalized to ensure fair comparisons between publications from different
scientific fields and different years. In a systematic large-scale empirical
analysis, we compare a traditional normalization approach based on a field
classification system with three source normalization approaches. We pay
special attention to the selection of the publications included in the
analysis. Publications in national scientific journals, popular scientific
magazines, and trade magazines are not included. Unlike earlier studies, we use
algorithmically constructed classification systems to evaluate the different
normalization approaches. Our analysis shows that a source normalization
approach based on the recently introduced idea of fractional citation counting
does not perform well. Two other source normalization approaches generally
outperform the classification-system-based normalization approach that we
study. Our analysis therefore offers considerable support for the use of
source-normalized bibliometric indicators.

consisting of more than 63 million articles and 1.45 billion citations on 254
subjects from 1981 to 2020. We proposed the Article's Scientific Prestige (ASP)
metric and compared this metric to number of citations (#Cit) and journal grade

that is computed based on the eigenvector centrality, considers both direct and
indirect citations, and provides steady-state evaluation cross different
disciplines. We found that ASP and #Cit are not aligned for most articles, with
a growing mismatch amongst the less cited articles. While both metrics are
reliable for evaluating the prestige of articles such as Nobel Prize winning
articles, ASP tends to provide more persuasive rankings than #Cit when the
articles are not highly cited. The journal grade, that is eventually determined
by a few highly cited articles, is unable to properly reflect the scientific
impact of individual articles. The number of references and coauthors are less
relevant to scientific impact, but subjects do make a difference.

We introduce RelSC, a new graph-regression dataset built from program graphs that combine syntactic and semantic information extracted from source code. Each graph is labelled with the execution-time cost of the corresponding program, providing a continuous target variable that differs markedly from those found in existing benchmarks. RelSC is released in two complementary variants. RelSC-H supplies rich node features under a single (homogeneous) edge type, while RelSC-M preserves the original multi-relational structure, connecting nodes through multiple edge types that encode distinct semantic relationships. Together, these variants let researchers probe how representation choice influences model behaviour. We evaluate a diverse set of graph neural network architectures on both variants of RelSC. The results reveal consistent performance differences between the homogeneous and multi-relational settings, emphasising the importance of structural representation. These findings demonstrate RelSC's value as a challenging and versatile benchmark for advancing graph regression methods."

growth of ever-changing interdisciplinary areas, researchers need an efficient
way to identify important scholarly work. The number of citations a given

time to occur and longer to accumulate. In this article, we use altmetrics to
predict the short-term and long-term citations that a scholarly publication
could receive. We build various classification and regression models and
evaluate their performance, finding neural networks and ensemble models to
perform best for these tasks. We also find that Mendeley readership is the most
important factor in predicting the early citations, followed by other factors
such as the academic status of the readers (e.g., student, postdoc, professor),
followers on Twitter, online post length, author count, and the number of

of its entries and directional information in their phase. A ""charge"" parameter
attunes spectral information to variation among directed cycles. We apply our

  Citation Bias",cs.DL cs.AI cs.LG cs.SI,"  Citation practices are crucial in shaping the structure of scientific
knowledge, yet they are often influenced by contemporary norms and biases. The
emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) introduces a new dynamic to these
practices. Interestingly, the characteristics and potential biases of
references recommended by LLMs that entirely rely on their parametric
knowledge, and not on search or retrieval-augmented generation, remain
unexplored. Here, we analyze these characteristics in an experiment using a
dataset from AAAI, NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR, published after GPT-4's knowledge
cut-off date. In our experiment, LLMs are tasked with suggesting scholarly
references for the anonymized in-text citations within these papers. Our
findings reveal a remarkable similarity between human and LLM citation
patterns, but with a more pronounced high citation bias, which persists even
after controlling for publication year, title length, number of authors, and
venue. The results hold for both GPT-4, and the more capable models GPT-4o and
Claude 3.5 where the papers are part of the training data. Additionally, we
observe a large consistency between the characteristics of LLM's existing and
non-existent generated references, indicating the model's internalization of
citation patterns. By analyzing citation graphs, we show that the references
recommended are embedded in the relevant citation context, suggesting an even
deeper conceptual internalization of the citation networks. While LLMs can aid
in citation generation, they may also amplify existing biases, such as the
Matthew effect, and introduce new ones, potentially skewing scientific
knowledge dissemination.

second topic is the normalization of citation impact indicators, in particular
normalization for field differences. Counting methods for dealing with
co-authored publications are the third topic, and citation impact indicators
for journals are the last topic. The paper concludes by offering some

  Publications",cs.DL cs.AI,"  Classifying scientific publications according to Field-of-Science (FoS)
taxonomies is of crucial importance, allowing funders, publishers, scholars,
companies and other stakeholders to organize scientific literature more
effectively. Most existing works address classification either at venue level
or solely based on the textual content of a research publication. We present
SciNoBo, a novel classification system of publications to predefined FoS
taxonomies, leveraging the structural properties of a publication and its
citations and references organised in a multilayer network. In contrast to
other works, our system supports assignments of publications to multiple fields
by considering their multidisciplinarity potential. By unifying publications
and venues under a common multilayer network structure made up of citing and
publishing relationships, classifications at the venue-level can be augmented
with publication-level classifications. We evaluate SciNoBo on a publications'
dataset extracted from Microsoft Academic Graph and we perform a comparative
analysis against a state-of-the-art neural-network baseline. The results reveal
that our proposed system is capable of producing high-quality classifications
of publications.

gnn_citations,graph neural networks for citation analysis,63,2407.19942,0.7327051,"Predicting citation impact of research papers using GPT and other text
  embeddings",cs.DL,"  The impact of research papers, typically measured in terms of citation
counts, depends on several factors, including the reputation of the authors,
journals, and institutions, in addition to the quality of the scientific work.
In this paper, we present an approach that combines natural language processing
and machine learning to predict the impact of papers in a specific journal. Our
focus is on the text, which should correlate with impact and the topics covered
in the research. We employed a dataset of over 40,000 articles from ACS Applied
Materials and Interfaces spanning from 2012 to 2022. The data was processed
using various text embedding techniques and classified with supervised machine
learning algorithms. Papers were categorized into the top 20% most cited within
the journal, using both yearly and cumulative citation counts as metrics. Our
analysis reveals that the method employing generative pre-trained transformers
(GPT) was the most efficient for embedding, while the random forest algorithm
exhibited the best predictive power among the machine learning algorithms. An
optimized accuracy of 80\% in predicting whether a paper was among the top 20%
most cited was achieved for the cumulative citation count when abstracts were
processed. This accuracy is noteworthy, considering that author, institution,
and early citation pattern information were not taken into account. The
accuracy increased only slightly when the full texts of the papers were
processed. Also significant is the finding that a simpler embedding technique,
term frequency-inverse document frequency (TFIDF), yielded performance close to
that of GPT. Since TFIDF captures the topics of the paper we infer that, apart
from considering author and institution biases, citation counts for the
considered journal may be predicted by identifying topics and ""reading"" the
abstract of a paper.

conducted using the peer review method, have begun opening to bibliometric
indicators. The citations received by a publication are assumed as proxy for
its quality, but they require standardization prior to use in comparative
evaluation of organizations or individual scientists: the citation data must be
standardized, due to the varying citation behavior across research fields. The
objective of this paper is to compare the effectiveness of the different
methods of normalizing citations, in order to provide useful indications to
research assessment practitioners. Simulating a typical national research
assessment exercise, he analysis is conducted for all subject categories in the
hard sciences and is based on the Thomson Reuters Science Citation
Index-Expanded. Comparisons show that the citations average is the most
effective scaling parameter, when the average is based only on the publications
actually cited.

applications, such as in artificial intelligence, biomedical research, and
engineering. We review popular methods for text analysis, ranging from topic
modeling to the recent neural language models. In particular, we review
Topic-SCORE, a statistical approach to topic modeling, and discuss how to use
it to analyze MADStat - a dataset on statistical publications that we collected
and cleaned.
  The application of Topic-SCORE and other methods on MADStat leads to
interesting findings. For example, $11$ representative topics in statistics are
identified. For each journal, the evolution of topic weights over time can be
visualized, and these results are used to analyze the trends in statistical
research. In particular, we propose a new statistical model for ranking the
citation impacts of $11$ topics, and we also build a cross-topic citation graph
to illustrate how research results on different topics spread to one another.
  The results on MADStat provide a data-driven picture of the statistical
research in $1975$--$2015$, from a text analysis perspective.

  Publications in Science Citation Index Expanded",cs.DL,"  This study aimed to identify and analyze the characteristics of highly cited
publications in the field of artificial intelligence within the Science
Citation Index Expanded from 1991 to 2022. The assessment focused on documents
that garnered 100 citations or more from the Web of Science Core Collection,
spanning from their publication date to the end of 2022. Various aspects of
these documents were analyzed, encompassing document types, the distribution of
annual production, the average number of citations per publication, Web of
Science categories, and journals. Moreover, the publication performance of
countries, institutions, and authors underwent evaluation through six
publication indicators and associated citation metrics. To facilitate a
comprehensive comparison of the authors research performance, the Y-index was
employed. The outcomes of the analysis revealed that a majority of the highly
cited articles were published within the Web of Science categories of
""artificial intelligence computer science"" and ""electrical and electronic
engineering"". Notably, the United States exhibited dominance across all six
publication indicators. Within the realm of average citations per publication,
the United Kingdom emerged as a leader for independent articles, first-author
articles, and corresponding-author articles. Exceptionally, the Chinese Academy
of Sciences in China and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the
USA, contributed significantly. The significant impact of highly cited articles
extended to the output of Stanford University in the USA. B.L. Bassler
published the most highly cited articles. Upon employing the Y-index analysis,
J.E.P. Santos was identified as having the highest potential for publication.
In addition to the primary analysis, this study also presented nine classic
articles that have left an indelible mark on artificial intelligence research.

convolutional architecture via a localized first-order approximation of
spectral graph convolutions. Our model scales linearly in the number of graph

networks and on a knowledge graph dataset we demonstrate that our approach
outperforms related methods by a significant margin.

complement one another in Academic Search recommendations. The scientific
literature can be viewed as a conversation between authors and the audience.
CBF uses abstracts to infer authors' positions, and GB uses citations to infer
responses from the audience. In this paper, we describe nine differences
between CBF and GB, as well as synergistic opportunities for hybrid
combinations. Two embeddings will be used to illustrate these opportunities:
(1) Specter, a CBF method based on BERT-like deepnet encodings of abstracts,
and (2) ProNE, a GB method based on spectral clustering of more than 200M
papers and 2B citations from Semantic Scholar.

relations. We consider here instead the indirect influence of publications on
new publications via citations. We present a novel method to quantify the
higher-order citation influence of publications, considering both direct, or
first-order, and indirect, or higher-order citations. In particular, we are
interested in higher-order citation influence at the level of disciplines. We
apply this method to the whole Web of Science data at the level of disciplines.
We find that a significant amount of influence -- 42% -- stems from
higher-order citations. Furthermore, we show that higher-order citation
influence is helpful to quantify and visualize citation flows among
disciplines, and to assess their degree of interdisciplinarity.

authority to cite while drafting decisions. In this paper, we develop a
citation recommendation tool that can help improve efficiency in the process of
opinion drafting. We train four types of machine learning models, including a
citation-list based method (collaborative filtering) and three context-based
methods (text similarity, BiLSTM and RoBERTa classifiers). Our experiments show
that leveraging local textual context improves recommendation, and that deep
neural models achieve decent performance. We show that non-deep text-based
methods benefit from access to structured case metadata, but deep models only
benefit from such access when predicting from context of insufficient length.
We also find that, even after extensive training, RoBERTa does not outperform a
recurrent neural model, despite its benefits of pretraining. Our behavior
analysis of the RoBERTa model further shows that predictive performance is
stable across time and citation classes.

  single-sentence single-label setting",cs.CL,"  Citation context analysis (CCA) is an important task in natural language
processing that studies how and why scholars discuss each others' work. Despite
decades of study, traditional frameworks for CCA have largely relied on
overly-simplistic assumptions of how authors cite, which ignore several
important phenomena. For instance, scholarly papers often contain rich
discussions of cited work that span multiple sentences and express multiple
intents concurrently. Yet, CCA is typically approached as a single-sentence,
single-label classification task, and thus existing datasets fail to capture
this interesting discourse. In our work, we address this research gap by
proposing a novel framework for CCA as a document-level context extraction and
labeling task. We release MultiCite, a new dataset of 12,653 citation contexts
from over 1,200 computational linguistics papers. Not only is it the largest
collection of expert-annotated citation contexts to-date, MultiCite contains
multi-sentence, multi-label citation contexts within full paper texts. Finally,
we demonstrate how our dataset, while still usable for training classic CCA
models, also supports the development of new types of models for CCA beyond
fixed-width text classification. We release our code and dataset at

We propose the x-index, a novel citation-based metric that conceptualizes citation as a process of knowledge diffusion and incorporates citation distance to reflect the structural reach of scholarly work. By weighting citations according to the collaborative proximity between citing and cited authors, the x-index captures both the depth and breadth of influence within evolving academic networks. Empirical analyses show that the x-index significantly improves the rankings of Turing Award recipients while reducing those of hyperprolific authors, better aligning rankings with recognized academic merit. It also demonstrates superior discriminatory power among early-career researchers and reveals stronger sensitivity to institutional research quality. These results suggest that the x-index offers a more equitable and forward-looking alternative to existing metrics, with practical applications in talent identification, funding decisions, and academic recommendation systems."
gnn_citations,graph neural networks for citation analysis,77,1910.10866,0.729975,DFNets: Spectral CNNs for Graphs with Feedback-Looped Filters,cs.LG stat.ML,"  We propose a novel spectral convolutional neural network (CNN) model on graph
structured data, namely Distributed Feedback-Looped Networks (DFNets). This
model is incorporated with a robust class of spectral graph filters, called
feedback-looped filters, to provide better localization on vertices, while
still attaining fast convergence and linear memory requirements. Theoretically,
feedback-looped filters can guarantee convergence w.r.t. a specified error
bound, and be applied universally to any graph without knowing its structure.
Furthermore, the propagation rule of this model can diversify features from the
preceding layers to produce strong gradient flows. We have evaluated our model
using two benchmark tasks: semi-supervised document classification on citation
networks and semi-supervised entity classification on a knowledge graph. The
experimental results show that our model considerably outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods in both benchmark tasks over all datasets.

Moving beyond traditional citation analysis, which primarily measures impact, KnoVo determines a paper's novelty relative to both prior and subsequent work within its multilayered citation network. Given a target paper's abstract, KnoVo utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to dynamically extract dimensions of comparison (e.g., methodology, application, dataset). The target paper is then compared to related publications along these same extracted dimensions. This comparative analysis, inspired by tournament selection, yields quantitative novelty scores reflecting the relative improvement, equivalence, or inferiority of the target paper in specific aspects. By aggregating these scores and visualizing their progression, for instance, through dynamic evolution graphs and comparative radar charts, KnoVo facilitates researchers not only to assess originality and identify similar work, but also to track knowledge evolution along specific research dimensions, uncover research gaps, and explore cross-disciplinary connections. We demonstrate these capabilities through a detailed analysis of 20 diverse papers from multiple scientific fields and report on the performance of various open-source LLMs within the KnoVo framework."
gnn_citations,graph neural networks for citation analysis,81,2503.06579,0.7276731,An Agent-based Model of Citation Behavior,cs.SI,"  Whether citations can be objectively and reliably used to measure
productivity and scientific quality of articles and researchers can, and
should, be vigorously questioned. However, citations are widely used to
estimate the productivity of researchers and institutions, effectively creating
a 'grubby' motivation to be well-cited. We model citation growth, and this
grubby interest using an agent-based model (ABM) of network growth. In this
model, each new node (article) in a citation network is an autonomous agent
that cites other nodes based on a 'citation personality' consisting of a
composite bias for locality, preferential attachment, recency, and fitness. We
ask whether strategic citation behavior (reference selection) by the author of
a scientific article can boost subsequent citations to it. Our study suggests
that fitness and, to a lesser extent, out_degree and locality effects are
influential in capturing citations, which raises questions about similar
effects in the real world.

gnn_citations,graph neural networks for citation analysis,82,1910.03498,0.7276719,SentiCite: An Approach for Publication Sentiment Analysis,cs.CL cs.DB cs.IR cs.LG stat.ML,"  With the rapid growth in the number of scientific publications, year after
year, it is becoming increasingly difficult to identify quality authoritative
work on a single topic. Though there is an availability of scientometric
measures which promise to offer a solution to this problem, these measures are
mostly quantitative and rely, for instance, only on the number of times an
article is cited. With this approach, it becomes irrelevant if an article is
cited 10 times in a positive, negative or neutral way. In this context, it is
quite important to study the qualitative aspect of a citation to understand its
significance. This paper presents a novel system for sentiment analysis of
citations in scientific documents (SentiCite) and is also capable of detecting
nature of citations by targeting the motivation behind a citation, e.g.,
reference to a dataset, reading reference. Furthermore, the paper also presents
two datasets (SentiCiteDB and IntentCiteDB) containing about 2,600 citations
with their ground truth for sentiment and nature of citation. SentiCite along
with other state-of-the-art methods for sentiment analysis are evaluated on the

for Science and Social Science databases in the Journal Citation Reports using
different measures. Total annual citation and impact factor, as well as a third
measure called the annual citation rate are used to make the detailed analysis.
We observe that the distribution of the annual citation rate has an universal
feature - it shows a maximum at the rate scaled by half the average,
irrespective of how the journals are ranked, and even across Science and Social
Science journals, and fits well to log-Gumbel distribution. Correlations
between different quantities are studied and a comparative analysis of the
three measures is presented. The newly introduced annual citation rate factor
helps in understanding the effect of scaling the number of citation by the
total number of publications. The effect of the impact factor on authors
contributing to the journals as well as on editorial policies is also
discussed.

discuss the conditions under which it applies as well as how to satisfy them in
deep neural networks. We show that RBP can be unstable and propose two variants
based on conjugate gradient on the normal equations (CG-RBP) and Neumann series
(Neumann-RBP). We further investigate the relationship between Neumann-RBP and
back propagation through time (BPTT) and its truncated version (TBPTT). Our
Neumann-RBP has the same time complexity as TBPTT but only requires constant
memory, whereas TBPTT's memory cost scales linearly with the number of
truncation steps. We examine all RBP variants along with BPTT and TBPTT in
three different application domains: associative memory with continuous
Hopfield networks, document classification in citation networks using graph
neural networks and hyperparameter optimization for fully connected networks.
All experiments demonstrate that RBPs, especially the Neumann-RBP variant, are
efficient and effective for optimizing convergent recurrent neural networks.

gnn_citations,graph neural networks for citation analysis,86,2012.05742,0.72664565,Longitudinal Citation Prediction using Temporal Graph Neural Networks,cs.CL cs.LG,"  Citation count prediction is the task of predicting the number of citations a
paper has gained after a period of time. Prior work viewed this as a static
prediction task. As papers and their citations evolve over time, considering
the dynamics of the number of citations a paper will receive would seem
logical. Here, we introduce the task of sequence citation prediction. The goal
is to accurately predict the trajectory of the number of citations a scholarly
work receives over time. We propose to view papers as a structured network of
citations, allowing us to use topological information as a learning signal.
Additionally, we learn how this dynamic citation network changes over time and
the impact of paper meta-data such as authors, venues and abstracts. To
approach the new task, we derive a dynamic citation network from Semantic
Scholar spanning over 42 years. We present a model which exploits topological
and temporal information using graph convolution networks paired with sequence
prediction, and compare it against multiple baselines, testing the importance
of topological and temporal information and analyzing model performance. Our
experiments show that leveraging both the temporal and topological information
greatly increases the performance of predicting citation counts over time.

such as counting of number of papers, citations and $h$-index. Since different
papers and different fields have largely different average number of co-authors
and of references we replace citations with individual citations, shared among
co-authors. Next, we improve on citation counting applying the PageRank
algorithm to citations among papers. Being time-ordered, this reduces to a
weighted counting of citation descendants that we call PaperRank. Similarly, we
compute an AuthorRank applying the PageRank algorithm to citations among
authors. These metrics quantify the impact of an author or paper taking into
account the impact of those authors that cite it. Finally, we show how self-
and circular- citations can be eliminated by defining a closed market of
citation-coins. We apply these metrics to the InSpire database that covers
fundamental physics, ranking papers, authors, journals, institutes, towns,
countries, continents, genders, for all-time and in recent time periods.

citation dynamics of scientific papers is nonlinear and this nonlinearity has
far-reaching consequences, such as diverging citation distributions and runaway
papers. We propose a nonlinear stochastic dynamic model of citation dynamics

for quantitative probabilistic prediction of citation dynamics of individual

cannot be directly compared because different scientific fields adopt different
citation practices. Citation counts are also strongly biased by paper age since
older papers had more time to attract citations. Various procedures aim at
suppressing these biases and give rise to new normalized indicators, such as
the relative citation count. We use a large citation dataset from Microsoft
Academic Graph and a new statistical framework based on the Mahalanobis
distance to show that the rankings by well known indicators, including the
relative citation count and Google's PageRank score, are significantly biased
by paper field and age. We propose a general normalization procedure motivated
by the $z$-score which produces much less biased rankings when applied to
citation count and PageRank score.

algorithms with various Graph Neural Network (GNN) models to bolster link

community detection algorithm into our GNN frameworks, we consistently enhance
performance across all models tested. For example, integrating Louvain with the

the typical improvements observed. Similar gains are noted when Louvain is
paired with other GNN architectures, confirming the robustness and
effectiveness of incorporating community-level insights. This consistent uplift
in performance reflected in our extensive experimentation on bipartite graphs
of scientific collaborations and citations highlights the synergistic potential
of combining community detection with GNNs to overcome common link prediction

using recurrent units to capture the long-term dependency across layers, our
methods can successfully identify important information during recursive
neighborhood expansion. In our experiments, we show that our model class
achieves state-of-the-art results on three benchmarks: the Pubmed, Reddit, and
PPI network datasets. Our in-depth analyses also demonstrate that incorporating
recurrent units is a simple yet effective method to prevent noisy information
in graphs, which enables a deeper graph neural network.

networks is analysed in a network fashion. The references of these articles are
used to construct a citation network data set, which is almost a directed
acyclic graph because only existing articles can be cited. A mixed membership
stochastic block model is then applied to this data set to soft cluster the
articles. The results obtained from a Gibbs sampler give us insights into the

  articles? A multi-discipline exploratory analysis",cs.DL,"  Many journals post accepted articles online before they are formally
published in an issue. Early citation impact evidence for these articles could
be helpful for timely research evaluation and to identify potentially important
articles that quickly attract many citations. This article investigates whether
Microsoft Academic can help with this task. For over 65,000 Scopus in-press
articles from 2016 and 2017 across 26 fields, Microsoft Academic found 2-5
times as many citations as Scopus, depending on year and field. From manual
checks of 1,122 Microsoft Academic citations not found in Scopus, Microsoft
Academic's citation indexing was faster but not much wider than Scopus for
journals. It achieved this by associating citations to preprints with their
subsequent in-press versions and by extracting citations from in-press
articles. In some fields its coverage of scholarly digital libraries, such as
arXiv.org, was also an advantage. Thus, Microsoft Academic seems to be a more
comprehensive automatic source of citation counts for in-press articles than
Scopus.

architectures that operate on graph-structured data, leveraging masked
self-attentional layers to address the shortcomings of prior methods based on
graph convolutions or their approximations. By stacking layers in which nodes
are able to attend over their neighborhoods' features, we enable (implicitly)
specifying different weights to different nodes in a neighborhood, without
requiring any kind of costly matrix operation (such as inversion) or depending
on knowing the graph structure upfront. In this way, we address several key
challenges of spectral-based graph neural networks simultaneously, and make our
model readily applicable to inductive as well as transductive problems. Our GAT
models have achieved or matched state-of-the-art results across four
established transductive and inductive graph benchmarks: the Cora, Citeseer and
Pubmed citation network datasets, as well as a protein-protein interaction
dataset (wherein test graphs remain unseen during training).

  of the American Mathematical Society",cs.DL,"  Peer review and citation metrics are two means of gauging the value of
scientific research, but the lack of publicly available peer review data makes
the comparison of these methods difficult. Mathematics can serve as a useful
laboratory for considering these questions because as an exact science, there
is a narrow range of reasons for citations. In mathematics, virtually all
published articles are post-publication reviewed by mathematicians in
Mathematical Reviews (MathSciNet) and so the data set was essentially the Web
of Science mathematics publications from 1993 to 2004. For a decade, especially
important articles were singled out in Mathematical Reviews for featured
reviews. In this study, we analyze the bibliometrics of elite articles selected
by peer review and by citation count. We conclude that the two notions of
significance described by being a featured review article and being highly
cited are distinct. This indicates that peer review and citation counts give
largely independent determinations of highly distinguished articles. We also
consider whether hiring patterns of subfields and mathematicians' interest in
subfields reflect subfields of featured review or highly cited articles. We
reexamine data from two earlier studies in light of our methods for
implications on the peer review/citation count relationship to a diversity of
disciplines.

To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel literature evaluation model of citation structural diversity, with a focus on assessing its feasibility as an evaluation metric. By refining citation network and incorporating both ciation structural features and semantic information, the study examines the influence of the proposed model of citation structural diversity on citation volume and long-term academic impact. The findings reveal that literature with higher citation structural diversity demonstrates notable advantages in both citation frequency and sustained academic influence. Through data grouping and a decade-long citation trend analysis, the potential application of this model in literature evaluation is further validated. This research offers a fresh perspective on optimizing literature evaluation methods and emphasizes the distinct advantages of citation structural diversity in measuring interdisciplinarity."
gnn_citations,graph neural networks for citation analysis,98,2305.01572,0.72528607,H2CGL: Modeling Dynamics of Citation Network for Impact Prediction,cs.DL cs.AI,"  The potential impact of a paper is often quantified by how many citations it
will receive. However, most commonly used models may underestimate the
influence of newly published papers over time, and fail to encapsulate this
dynamics of citation network into the graph. In this study, we construct
hierarchical and heterogeneous graphs for target papers with an annual
perspective. The constructed graphs can record the annual dynamics of target
papers' scientific context information. Then, a novel graph neural network,
Hierarchical and Heterogeneous Contrastive Graph Learning Model (H2CGL), is
proposed to incorporate heterogeneity and dynamics of the citation network.
H2CGL separately aggregates the heterogeneous information for each year and
prioritizes the highly-cited papers and relationships among references,
citations, and the target paper. It then employs a weighted GIN to capture
dynamics between heterogeneous subgraphs over years. Moreover, it leverages
contrastive learning to make the graph representations more sensitive to
potential citations. Particularly, co-cited or co-citing papers of the target
paper with large citation gap are taken as hard negative samples, while
randomly dropping low-cited papers could generate positive samples. Extensive
experimental results on two scholarly datasets demonstrate that the proposed
H2CGL significantly outperforms a series of baseline approaches for both
previously and freshly published papers. Additional analyses highlight the
significance of the proposed modules. Our codes and settings have been released
on Github (https://github.com/ECNU-Text-Computing/H2CGL)

scientific-scholarly journals upon patentable technology, as reflected in
examiner- or inventor-given references in granted patents. It analyses data
created by SCImago Research Group, linking PATSTAT's scientific non-patent
references (SNPRs) to source documents indexed in Scopus. The frequency of
patent citations to journal papers is calculated per discipline, year,
institutional sector, journal subject category, and for ""top"" journals.
PATSTAT/Scopus-based statistics are compared to those derived from Web of
Science/USPTO linkage. A detailed assessment is presented of the technological
impact of research publications in social sciences and humanities (SSH).
Several subject fields perform well in terms of the number of citations from
patents, especially Library & Information Science, Language & Linguistics,
Education, and Law, but many of the most cited journals find themselves in the
interface between SSH and biomedical or natural sciences. Analyses of the
titles of citing patents and cited papers are presented that shed light upon
the cognitive content of patent citations. It is proposed to develop more
advanced indicators of citation impact of papers upon patents, and ways to
combine citation counts with citation content and context analysis.

  Classification",cs.LG math.OC,"  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful deep learning models designed for
graph-structured data, demonstrating effectiveness across a wide range of
applications.The softmax function is the most commonly used classifier for
semi-supervised node classification. However, the softmax function lacks
spatial information of the graph structure. In this paper, we propose a graph
similarity regularized softmax for GNNs in semi-supervised node classification.
By incorporating non-local total variation (TV) regularization into the softmax
activation function, we can more effectively capture the spatial information
inherent in graphs. The weights in the non-local gradient and divergence
operators are determined based on the graph's adjacency matrix. We apply the
proposed method into the architecture of GCN and GraphSAGE, testing them on
citation and webpage linking datasets, respectively. Numerical experiments
demonstrate its good performance in node classification and generalization
capabilities. These results indicate that the graph similarity regularized
softmax is effective on both assortative and disassortative graphs.

research evaluation based on Galton's ""Wisdom of Crowds"" (1907). Citations are
based on the assessment of many which is why they can be ascribed a certain
amount of accuracy. However, we show that citations are incomplete assessments
and that one cannot assume that a high number of citations correlate with a
high level of usefulness. Only when one knows that a rarely cited paper has
been widely read is it possible to say (strictly speaking) that it was
obviously of little use for further research. Using a comparison with 'like'
data, we try to determine that cited reference analysis allows a more
meaningful analysis of bibliometric data than times-cited analysis.

Methods (1&2): The indicators calculated from 28.6 million articles were compared through 8,704 correlations on two gold standards for 97,816 UK Research Excellence Framework (REF) 2021 articles. The primary gold standard is ChatGPT scores, and the secondary is the average REF2021 expert review score for the department submitting the article. Results: (1) OpenAlex provides better citation counts than Scopus and its inclusive document classification/scope does not seem to cause substantial field normalisation problems. The broadest OpenAlex classification scheme provides the best indicators. (2) Counterintuitively, raw citation counts are at least as good as nearly all field normalised indicators, and better for single years, and NCS is better than NLCS. (1&2) There are substantial field differences. Thus, (1) OpenAlex is suitable for citation analysis in most fields and (2) the major citation-based indicators seem to work counterintuitively compared to quality judgements. Field normalisation seems ineffective because more cited fields tend to produce higher quality work, affecting interdisciplinary research or within-field topic differences."

  altmetric indicators with citations from a multidisciplinary perspective",cs.DL,"  An extensive analysis of the presence of different altmetric indicators
provided by Altmetric.com across scientific fields is presented, particularly
focusing on their relationship with citations. Our results confirm that the
presence and density of social media altmetric counts are still very low and
not very frequent among scientific publications, with 15%-24% of the
publications presenting some altmetric activity and concentrating in the most
recent publications, although their presence is increasing over time.
Publications from the social sciences, humanities and the medical and life
sciences show the highest presence of altmetrics, indicating their potential
value and interest for these fields. The analysis of the relationships between
altmetrics and citations confirms previous claims of positive correlations but
relatively weak, thus supporting the idea that altmetrics do not reflect the
same concept of impact as citations. Also, altmetric counts do not always
present a better filtering of highly cited publications than journal citation
scores. Altmetrics scores (particularly mentions in blogs) are able to identify
highly cited publications with higher levels of precision than journal citation
scores (JCS), but they have a lower level of recall. The value of altmetrics as
a complementary tool of citation analysis is highlighted, although more
research is suggested to disentangle the potential meaning and value of
altmetric indicators for research evaluation.

  of a new citation impact indicator",cs.DL physics.soc-ph,"  In this paper, a new field-normalized indicator is introduced, which is
rooted in early insights in bibliometrics, and is compared with several
established field-normalized indicators (e.g. the mean normalized citation
score, MNCS, and indicators based on percentile approaches). Garfield (1979)
emphasizes that bare citation counts from different fields cannot be compared
for evaluative purposes, because the ""citation potential"" can vary
significantly between the fields. Garfield (1979) suggests that ""the most
accurate measure of citation potential is the average number of references per
paper published in a given field"". Based on this suggestion, the new indicator
is basically defined as follows: the citation count of a focal paper is divided
by the mean number of cited references in a field to normalize citations. The
new indicator is called citation score normalized by cited references (CSNCR).
The theoretical analysis of the CSNCR shows that it has the properties of
consistency and homogeneous normalization. The close relation of the new
indicator to the MNCS is discussed. The empirical comparison of the CSNCR with
other field-normalized indicators shows that it is slightly poorer able to
field-normalize citation counts than other cited-side normalized indicators
(e.g. the MNCS), but its results are favorable compared to two citing-side
indicator variants (SNCS indicators). Taken as a whole, the results of this
study confirm the ability of established indicators to field-normalize
citations.

accelerating rate of research publication, together with the recognised
benefits of interdisciplinary research, systems that facilitate researchers in
discovering and understanding relevant works from beyond their immediate school

capable of preserving the interdisciplinary implications of research papers in
their embeddings. In addition to evaluating state of the art methods of
document embedding in a interdisciplinary citation prediction task, we propose
a novel Graph Neural Network architecture designed to preserve the key
interdisciplinary implications of research articles in citation network node
embeddings. Our proposed method outperforms other GNN-based methods in
interdisciplinary citation prediction, without compromising overall citation
prediction performance.

field. We compare the 40 leading researchers in terms of their popularity and
prestige over time. Some authors are ranked high on prestige but not on
popularity, while others are ranked high on popularity but not on prestige. We
also relate measures of popularity and prestige to date of Ph.D. award, number
of key publications, organizational affiliation, receipt of prizes/honors, and
gender.

editorial process quality, and the editorial and visibility strategies of
Bibliotecas. Anales de Investigacion (BAI), a scientific Cuban journal edited
by National Library of Cuba Jose Marti. The academic impact is determined
through a citation analysis, which considers Google Scholar database as
reference source. The bibliometric indicators applied are: citation per year,
citation vs. self-citation, citable journals vs. non-citable documents, Hirsch
Index, and impact factor. The editorial process quality and the visibility
strategies are determined through a self-evaluation which takes into account
the SciELO, Scopus, CLASE, Redalyc, Latindex, Dialnet, and ERIH PLUS
methodologies. The results reveal an ascending citation line that highlights
citing journals from the field of Library and Information Science, Medicine and
Health Sciences, and Education. Aspects related content and format have
negatively influenced on editorial process quality. Some strategies are
proposed to improve scientific visibility through the inclusion in databases,
directories, and social and academic networks. In general, this study
contributes to the editorial decision taking, an issue that could augment the
impact and scientific visibility of BAI.

  scientific publications",cs.DL,"  The citation impact of a scientific publication is usually seen as a
one-dimensional concept. We introduce a multi-dimensional framework for
characterizing the citation impact of a publication. In addition to the level
of citation impact, quantified by the number of citations received by a
publication, we also conceptualize and operationalize the depth and breadth and
the dependence and independence of the citation impact of a publication. The
proposed framework distinguishes between publications that have a deep citation
impact, typically in a relatively narrow research area, and publications that
have a broad citation impact, probably covering a wider area of research. It
also makes a distinction between publications that are strongly dependent on
earlier work and publications that make a more independent scientific
contribution. We use our multi-dimensional citation impact framework to report
basic descriptive statistics on the citation impact of highly cited
publications in all scientific disciplines. In addition, we present a detailed
case study focusing on the field of scientometrics. The proposed citation
impact framework provides a more in-depth understanding of the citation impact
of a publication than a traditional one-dimensional perspective.

gnn_citations,graph neural networks for citation analysis,111,1004.3351,0.7230761,Citing for High Impact,cs.DL,"  The question of citation behavior has always intrigued scientists from
various disciplines. While general citation patterns have been widely studied
in the literature we develop the notion of citation projection graphs by
investigating the citations among the publications that a given paper cites. We
investigate how patterns of citations vary between various scientific
disciplines and how such patterns reflect the scientific impact of the paper.
We find that idiosyncratic citation patterns are characteristic for low impact
papers; while narrow, discipline-focused citation patterns are common for
medium impact papers. Our results show that crossing-community, or bridging
citation patters are high risk and high reward since such patterns are
characteristic for both low and high impact papers. Last, we observe that
recently citation networks are trending toward more bridging and
interdisciplinary forms.

between Mendeley readership and citation counts with particular documents
bibliographic characteristics. A data set of 1.3 million publications from
different fields published in journals covered by the Web of Science (WoS) has
been analyzed. This work reveals that document types that are often excluded
from citation analysis due to their lower citation values, like editorial
materials, letters, or news items, are strongly covered and saved in Mendeley,
suggesting that Mendeley readership can reliably inform the analysis of these
document types. Findings show that collaborative papers are frequently saved in
Mendeley, which is similar to what is observed for citations. The relationship
between readership and the length of titles and number of pages, however, is
weaker than for the same relationship observed for citations. The analysis of
different disciplines also points to different patterns in the relationship
between several document characteristics, readership, and citation counts.
Overall, results highlight that although disciplinary differences exist,
readership counts are related to similar bibliographic characteristics as those
related to citation counts, reinforcing the idea that Mendeley readership and
citations capture a similar concept of impact, although they cannot be
considered as equivalent indicators.

its evaluation. While their content and structure differ substantially, there
exist only informal notions on their reliability. Here we compare the
topological consistency of citation networks extracted from six popular
bibliographic databases including Web of Science, CiteSeer and arXiv.org. The
networks are assessed through a rich set of local and global graph statistics.
We first reveal statistically significant inconsistencies between some of the
databases with respect to individual statistics. For example, the introduced
field bow-tie decomposition of DBLP Computer Science Bibliography substantially
differs from the rest due to the coverage of the database, while the citation
information within arXiv.org is the most exhaustive. Finally, we compare the
databases over multiple graph statistics using the critical difference diagram.
The citation topology of DBLP Computer Science Bibliography is the least
consistent with the rest, while, not surprisingly, Web of Science is
significantly more reliable from the perspective of consistency. This work can
serve either as a reference for scholars in bibliometrics and scientometrics or
a scientific evaluation guideline for governments and research agencies.

by including within deep learning a graph that summarises pairwise

methods that consider the graph as the originator of an explicit graph
diffusion. We show that appending graph diffusion to feature-based learning as
an \textit{a posteriori} refinement achieves state-of-the-art classification
accuracy. This method, which we call Graph Diffusion Reclassification (GDR),
uses overshooting events of a diffusive graph dynamics to reclassify individual
nodes. The method uses intrinsic measures of node influence, which are distinct
for each node, and allows the evaluation of the relationship and importance of
features and graph for classification. We also present diff-GCN, a simple
extension of Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCN) architectures that
leverages explicit diffusion dynamics, and allows the natural use of directed
graphs. To showcase our methods, we use benchmark datasets of documents with
associated citation data.

cases negative. Our analysis of 6 different factors, calculated both at the

current metrics may be misleading in research systems that pursue
simultaneously different goals, such as the advance of science and incremental
innovations, because their publications have different citation distributions.
We estimate the contribution to the progress of knowledge by studying only a
limited number of the most cited papers, which are dominated by publications
pursuing this progress. To field-normalize the metrics, we substitute the
number of citations by the rank position of papers from one country in the
global list of papers. Using synthetic series of lognormally distributed
numbers, we developed the Rk-index, which is calculated from the global ranks
of the 10 highest numbers in each series, and demonstrate its equivalence to
the number of papers in top percentiles, P_top0.1% and P_top0.01% . In real
cases, the Rk-index is simple and easy to calculate, and evaluates the
contribution to the progress of knowledge better than less stringent metrics.
Although further research is needed, rank analysis of the most cited papers is
a promising approach for research evaluation. It is also demonstrated that, for
this purpose, domestic and collaborative papers should be studied
independently.

the share of the total citations in a local citation environment, which is
expressed as a ratio and can be visualized by the size of the nodes. The
vertical size of the nodes varies proportionally to a journal's total citation
share, while the horizontal size of the nodes is used to provide citation
information after correction for the within-journal (self-) citations. In this
study, we analyze citation impacts of three Chinese journals in mathematics and
compare local citation impacts with impact factors. Local citation impacts
reflect a journal's status and function better than (global) impact factors. We
also found that authors in Chinese journals prefer international instead of

  Approach",cs.IR cs.CL,"  Knowledge about the software used in scientific investigations is necessary
for different reasons, including provenance of the results, measuring software
impact to attribute developers, and bibliometric software citation analysis in
general. Additionally, providing information about whether and how the software
and the source code are available allows an assessment about the state and role
of open source software in science in general. While such analyses can be done
manually, large scale analyses require the application of automated methods of
information extraction and linking. In this paper, we present SoftwareKG - a
knowledge graph that contains information about software mentions from more
than 51,000 scientific articles from the social sciences. A silver standard
corpus, created by a distant and weak supervision approach, and a gold standard
corpus, created by manual annotation, were used to train an LSTM based neural
network to identify software mentions in scientific articles. The model
achieves a recognition rate of .82 F-score in exact matches. As a result, we
identified more than 133,000 software mentions. For entity disambiguation, we
used the public domain knowledge base DBpedia. Furthermore, we linked the
entities of the knowledge graph to other knowledge bases such as the Microsoft
Academic Knowledge Graph, the Software Ontology, and Wikidata. Finally, we
illustrate, how SoftwareKG can be used to assess the role of software in the
social sciences.

easier than coming back. Social artifacts such as genealogy charts and citation
graphs are inherently directed. In reinforcement learning and control, optimal
goal-reaching strategies are rarely reversible (symmetrical). Distance
functions supported on these asymmetrical structures are called quasimetrics.
Despite their common appearance, little research has been done on the learning
of quasimetrics.
  Our theoretical analysis reveals that a common class of learning algorithms,
including unconstrained multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), provably fails to learn
a quasimetric consistent with training data. In contrast, our proposed Poisson
Quasimetric Embedding (PQE) is the first quasimetric learning formulation that
both is learnable with gradient-based optimization and enjoys strong
performance guarantees. Experiments on random graphs, social graphs, and
offline Q-learning demonstrate its effectiveness over many common baselines.

  empirical analysis",cs.DL cs.IR cs.SI physics.soc-ph,"  Journal rankings are widely used and are often based on citation data in
combination with a network perspective. We argue that some of these
network-based rankings can produce misleading results. From a theoretical point
of view, we show that the standard network modelling approach of citation data
at the journal level (i.e., the projection of paper citations onto journals)
introduces fictitious relations among journals. To overcome this problem, we
propose a citation path perspective, and empirically show that rankings based
on the network and the citation path perspective are very different. Based on
our theoretical and empirical analysis, we highlight the limitations of
standard network metrics, and propose a method to overcome these limitations
and compute journal rankings.

gnn_citations,graph neural networks for citation analysis,124,2202.06671,0.7199543,"Neighborhood Contrastive Learning for Scientific Document
  Representations with Citation Embeddings",cs.CL,"  Learning scientific document representations can be substantially improved
through contrastive learning objectives, where the challenge lies in creating
positive and negative training samples that encode the desired similarity
semantics. Prior work relies on discrete citation relations to generate
contrast samples. However, discrete citations enforce a hard cut-off to
similarity. This is counter-intuitive to similarity-based learning, and ignores
that scientific papers can be very similar despite lacking a direct citation -
a core problem of finding related research. Instead, we use controlled nearest
neighbor sampling over citation graph embeddings for contrastive learning. This
control allows us to learn continuous similarity, to sample hard-to-learn
negatives and positives, and also to avoid collisions between negative and
positive samples by controlling the sampling margin between them. The resulting
method SciNCL outperforms the state-of-the-art on the SciDocs benchmark.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that it can train (or tune) models
sample-efficiently, and that it can be combined with recent training-efficient
methods. Perhaps surprisingly, even training a general-domain language model
this way outperforms baselines pretrained in-domain.

as well as those citing, NIME papers; for brevity, we refer to these as
`references` and `citations`. Utilizing existing tools, we have computationally
extracted data from the NIME proceedings archive and retrieved metadata from an
academic database, including details of associated references and citations.
From this data, we computed a range of metrics and statistics, which we present
in this paper. We offer quantitative insights into NIME as a scholarly
publication venue, its connections to other venues, and its relationship with
various fields of study and authors. Based on our data interpretations, we
provide several recommendations for the community's future. In sharing the
software we developed for this study, and the summarized raw data, we enable
other NIME researchers to conduct more in-depth investigations and examine
specific trends.

  Ratios (PWR) as a Journal Indicator",cs.DL,"  Ramanujacharyulu's (1964) Power-Weakness Ratio (PWR) measures impact by
recursively multiplying the citation matrix by itself until convergence is
reached in both the cited and citing dimensions; the quotient of these values
is defined as PWR, whereby ""cited"" is considered as power and ""citing"" as
weakness. Analytically, PWR is an attractive candidate for measuring journal
impact because of its symmetrical handling of the rows and columns in the
asymmetrical citation matrix, its recursive algorithm, and its mathematical
elegance. In this study, PWR is discussed and critically assessed in relation
to other size-independent recursive metrics. A test using the set of 83
journals in ""information and library science"" (according to the Web-of-Science
categorization) converged, but did not provide interpretable results. Further
decomposition of this set into homogeneous sub-graphs shows that--like most
other journal indicators--PWR can perhaps be used within homogeneous sets, but
not across citation communities.

gnn_citations,graph neural networks for citation analysis,128,2406.12535,0.71906376,Predicting Award Winning Research Papers at Publication Time,cs.IR,"  In recent years, many studies have been focusing on predicting the scientific
impact of research papers. Most of these predictions are based on citations
count or rely on features obtainable only from already published papers. In
this study, we predict the likelihood for a research paper of winning an award
only relying on information available at publication time. For each paper, we
build the citation subgraph induced from its bibliography. We initially
consider some features of this subgraph, such as the density and the global
clustering coefficient, to make our prediction. Then, we mix this information
with textual features, extracted from the abstract and the title, to obtain a
more accurate final prediction. We made our experiments considering the
ArnetMiner citation graph, while the ground truth on award-winning papers has
been obtained from a collection of best paper awards from 32 computer science
conferences. In our experiment, we obtained an encouraging F1 score of 0.694.
Remarkably, The high recall and the low false negatives rate, show how the
model performs very well at identifying papers that will not win an award. This
behavior can help researchers in getting a first evaluation of their work at
publication time. Lastly, we made some first experiments on interpretability.
Our results highlight some interesting patterns both in topological and textual
features.

  different approaches and an empirical comparison",cs.DL,"  Different scientific fields have different citation practices. Citation-based
bibliometric indicators need to normalize for such differences between fields
in order to allow for meaningful between-field comparisons of citation impact.
Traditionally, normalization for field differences has usually been done based
on a field classification system. In this approach, each publication belongs to
one or more fields and the citation impact of a publication is calculated
relative to the other publications in the same field. Recently, the idea of
source normalization was introduced, which offers an alternative approach to
normalize for field differences. In this approach, normalization is done by
looking at the referencing behavior of citing publications or citing journals.
In this paper, we provide an overview of a number of source normalization
approaches and we empirically compare these approaches with a traditional
normalization approach based on a field classification system. We also pay
attention to the issue of the selection of the journals to be included in a
normalization for field differences. Our analysis indicates a number of
problems of the traditional classification-system-based normalization approach,
suggesting that source normalization approaches may yield more accurate
results.

  years shortly after the publication date?",cs.DL stat.AP,"  The findings of Bornmann, Leydesdorff, and Wang (in press) revealed that the
consideration of journal impact improves the prediction of long-term citation
impact. This paper further explores the possibility of improving citation
impact measurements on the base of a short citation window by the consideration
of journal impact and other variables, such as the number of authors, the
number of cited references, and the number of pages. The dataset contains
475,391 journal papers published in 1980 and indexed in Web of Science (WoS,
Thomson Reuters), and all annual citation counts (from 1980 to 2010) for these
papers. As an indicator of citation impact, we used percentiles of citations
calculated using the approach of Hazen (1914). Our results show that citation
impact measurement can really be improved: If factors generally influencing
citation impact are considered in the statistical analysis, the explained
variance in the long-term citation impact can be much increased. However, this
increase is only visible when using the years shortly after publication but not
when using later years.

SciEvo is easy to use and available across platforms, including GitHub, Kaggle, and HuggingFace. Using SciEvo, we conduct a temporal study spanning over 30 years to explore key questions in scientometrics: the evolution of academic terminology, citation patterns, and interdisciplinary knowledge exchange. Our findings reveal critical insights, such as disparities in epistemic cultures, knowledge production modes, and citation practices. For example, rapidly developing, application-driven fields like LLMs exhibit significantly shorter citation age (2.48 years) compared to traditional theoretical disciplines like oral history (9.71 years).

gnn_citations,graph neural networks for citation analysis,132,2304.04821,0.7184418,Characteristics of LIS Research Articles Affecting Their Citation Impact,cs.DL cs.SI,"  The paper analyses the citation impact of Library and Information Science,
LIS for short, research articles published in 31 leading international LIS
journals in 2015. The main research question is: to what degree do authors'
disciplinary composition in association with other content characteristics of
LIS articles affect their citation impact? The impact is analysed in terms of
the number of citations received and their authority, using outlier
normalization and subfield normalization. The article characteristics analysed
using quantitative content analysis include topic, methodology, type of
contribution, and the disciplinary composition of their author teams. The
citations received by the articles are traced from 2015 to May 2021. Citing
document authority is measured by the citations they had received up to May
2021. The overall finding was that authors' disciplinary composition is
significantly associated with citation scores. The differences in citation
scores between disciplinary compositions appeared typically within information
retrieval and scientific communication. In both topics LIS and computer science
jointly received significantly higher citation scores than many disciplines
like LIS alone or humanities in information retrieval, or natural sciences,
medicine, or social sciences alone in scientific communication. The paper is
original in allowing joint analysis of content, authorship composition, and
impact.

This further improves prediction by 3.1 points of average precision and by 8.5 points in data sparsity as well as showing robust performance over time and in challenging fully inductive prediction. Jointly learning and predicting case and norm citations achieves a large synergistic effect that improves case citation prediction by up to 4.7 points, at almost doubled efficiency."

Meanwhile, the number of DCCPs of papers published in different years does not

(GCNs) is related to the alignment between features, graph, and ground truth,
which we quantify using a subspace alignment measure (SAM) corresponding to the
Frobenius norm of the matrix of pairwise chordal distances between three
subspaces associated with features, graph, and ground truth. The proposed
measure is based on the principal angles between subspaces and has both
spectral and geometrical interpretations. We showcase the relationship between
the SAM and the classification performance through the study of limiting cases
of GCNs and systematic randomizations of both features and graph structure
applied to a constructive example and several examples of citation networks of
different origins. The analysis also reveals the relative importance of the
graph and features for classification purposes.

citations, as simple citation count is found to tell only part of the story
regarding scientific impact. This extension is deemed to be beneficial in
scenarios like research evaluation, science history modeling, and information
retrieval. In contrast to citations of citations (forward citation
generations), references of references (backward citation generations) as
another side of high-order citations, is relatively less explored. We adopt a
series of metrics for measuring the unfolding of backward citations of a focal
paper, tracing back to its knowledge ancestors generation by generation. Two
sub-fields in Physics are subject to such analysis on a large-scale citation
network. Preliminary results show that (1) most papers in our dataset can be
traced to their knowledge ancestry; (2) the size distribution of backward
citation generations presents a decreasing-and-then-increasing shape; and (3)
citations more than one generation away are still relevant to the focal paper,
from either a forward or backward perspective; yet, backward citation
generations are higher in topic relevance to the paper of interest.
Furthermore, the backward citation generations shed lights for literature
recommendation, science evaluation, and sociology of science studies.

learning based approaches for citation sentiment classification, which is in
turn compared with Bag-of-Words approach. Experimental results demonstrate that
deep learning is useful for higher number of samples, whereas support vector
machine is the winner for smaller number of samples. Moreover, context-based
samples are proved to be more effective than context-less samples for citation

accuracy on a number of standard benchmark datasets for graph-based
semi-supervised learning, improving significantly over existing approaches.
These architectures alternate between a propagation layer that aggregates the
hidden states of the local neighborhood and a fully-connected layer. Perhaps
surprisingly, we show that a linear model, that removes all the intermediate
fully-connected layers, is still able to achieve a performance comparable to
the state-of-the-art models. This significantly reduces the number of
parameters, which is critical for semi-supervised learning where number of
labeled examples are small. This in turn allows a room for designing more
innovative propagation layers. Based on this insight, we propose a novel graph
neural network that removes all the intermediate fully-connected layers, and
replaces the propagation layers with attention mechanisms that respect the
structure of the graph. The attention mechanism allows us to learn a dynamic
and adaptive local summary of the neighborhood to achieve more accurate
predictions. In a number of experiments on benchmark citation networks
datasets, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms competing methods. By
examining the attention weights among neighbors, we show that our model
provides some interesting insights on how neighbors influence each other.

  Interdisciplinarity -- A Tribute to Eugene Garfield --",cs.DL,"  Journals were central to Eugene Garfield's research interests. Among other
things, journals are considered as units of analysis for bibliographic
databases such as the Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus. In addition to
disciplinary classifications of journals, journal citation patterns span
networks across boundaries to variable extents. Using betweenness centrality
(BC) and diversity, we elaborate on the question of how to distinguish and rank
journals in terms of interdisciplinarity. Interdisciplinarity, however, is
difficult to operationalize in the absence of an operational definition of
disciplines, the diversity of a unit of analysis is sample-dependent. BC can be
considered as a measure of multi-disciplinarity. Diversity of co-citation in a
citing document has been considered as an indicator of knowledge integration,
but an author can also generate trans-disciplinary--that is,
non-disciplined--variation by citing sources from other disciplines. Diversity
in the bibliographic coupling among citing documents can analogously be
considered as diffusion of knowledge across disciplines. Because the citation
networks in the cited direction reflect both structure and variation, diversity
in this direction is perhaps the best available measure of interdisciplinarity
at the journal level. Furthermore, diversity is based on a summation and can
therefore be decomposed, differences among (sub)sets can be tested for
statistical significance. In an appendix, a general-purpose routine for
measuring diversity in networks is provided.

In turn, this gap authorizes the exclusion of researchers and scholars from the South in indexing services, reinforcing colonial arrangements that de-center and minoritize those scholars. In order to support citation network tracking on a global scale, we investigate the capacity of open-weight language models to mark up manuscript citations in an indexable format. We assembled a dataset of matched plaintext and annotated citations from preprints and published research papers. Then, we evaluated a number of open-weight language models on the annotation task. We find that, even out of the box, today's language models achieve high levels of accuracy on identifying the constituent components of each citation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the smallest model we evaluated, Qwen3-0.6B, can parse all fields with high accuracy in $2^5$ passes, suggesting that post-training is likely to be effective in producing small, robust citation parsing models. Such a tool could greatly improve the fidelity of citation networks and thus meaningfully improve research indexing and discovery, as well as further metascientific research."

the reception of publications and the scholarly discourse. Outcomes of citation
analyses and the applicability of citation based machine learning approaches
heavily depend on the completeness of such data. One particular shortcoming of
scholarly data nowadays is that non-English publications are often not included
in data sets, or that language metadata is not available. Because of this,
citations between publications of differing languages (cross-lingual citations)
have only been studied to a very limited degree. In this paper, we present an
analysis of cross-lingual citations based on over one million English papers,
spanning three scientific disciplines and a time span of three decades. Our
investigation covers differences between cited languages and disciplines,
trends over time, and the usage characteristics as well as impact of
cross-lingual citations. Among our findings are an increasing rate of citations
to publications written in Chinese, citations being primarily to local
non-English languages, and consistency in citation intent between cross- and
monolingual citations. To facilitate further research, we make our collected

the most highly cited researchers, underscoring their foundational
contributions to the field. Co-authorship network analysis reveals strong
international collaborations, with Sheikhholeslami, S.M. exhibiting the highest
total link strength, while the United States emerges as the leading hub for
global research partnerships. Keyword co-occurrence analysis identifies four
major research clusters: graph algorithms, graph-theoretic foundations,
domination variants, and binary graph operations. Notably, recent studies
increasingly focus on how domination properties evolve under different graph
operations. Citation network analysis confirms the enduring influence of
foundational studies while highlighting a shift towards computational and
applied methodologies. These findings highlight the transition from theoretical
to applied research, emphasizing the role of advanced algorithms,
interdisciplinary approaches, and large-scale computational techniques. Future

complete paper or a small portion of text called a citation context. The
process of recommending citations for citation contexts is called local
citation recommendation and is the focus of this paper. Firstly, we develop
citation recommendation approaches based on embeddings, topic modeling, and
information retrieval techniques. We combine, for the first time to the best of
our knowledge, the best-performing algorithms into a semi-genetic hybrid
recommender system for citation recommendation. We evaluate the single
approaches and the hybrid approach offline based on several data sets, such as
the Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) and the MAG in combination with arXiv and
ACL. We further conduct a user study for evaluating our approaches online. Our
evaluation results show that a hybrid model containing embedding and
information retrieval-based components outperforms its individual components
and further algorithms by a large margin.

academia (from published papers), business (through patents) and law (through
legal judgements). A citation represents a transfer of information, and so
studying the structure of the citation network will help us understand how
knowledge is passed on. What distinguishes citation networks from other
networks is time; documents can only cite older documents. We propose that
existing network measures do not take account of the strong constraint imposed
by time. We will illustrate our approach with two types of causally aware
analysis. We apply our methods to the citation networks formed by academic
papers on the arXiv, to US patents and to US Supreme Court judgements. We show
that our tools can reveal that citation networks which appear to have very
similar structure by standard network measures turn out to have significantly
different properties. We interpret our results as indicating that many papers
in a bibliography were not directly relevant to the work and that we can
provide a simple indicator of the important citations. We suggest our methods
may highlight papers which are of more interest for interdisciplinary research.
We also quantify differences in the diversity of research directions of
different fields.

  Transformers",cs.CL,"  Representation learning is a critical ingredient for natural language
processing systems. Recent Transformer language models like BERT learn powerful
textual representations, but these models are targeted towards token- and
sentence-level training objectives and do not leverage information on
inter-document relatedness, which limits their document-level representation
power. For applications on scientific documents, such as classification and
recommendation, the embeddings power strong performance on end tasks. We
propose SPECTER, a new method to generate document-level embedding of
scientific documents based on pretraining a Transformer language model on a
powerful signal of document-level relatedness: the citation graph. Unlike
existing pretrained language models, SPECTER can be easily applied to
downstream applications without task-specific fine-tuning. Additionally, to
encourage further research on document-level models, we introduce SciDocs, a
new evaluation benchmark consisting of seven document-level tasks ranging from
citation prediction, to document classification and recommendation. We show
that SPECTER outperforms a variety of competitive baselines on the benchmark.

  scientific papers",physics.soc-ph cs.DL,"  Collaborations and citations within scientific research grow simultaneously
and interact dynamically. Modelling the coevolution between them helps to study
many phenomena that can be approached only through combining citation and
coauthorship data. A geometric graph for the coevolution is proposed, the
mechanism of which synthetically expresses the interactive impacts of authors
and papers in a geometrical way. The model is validated against a data set of
papers published on PNAS during 2007-2015. The validation shows the ability to
reproduce a range of features observed with citation and coauthorship data
combined and separately. Particularly, in the empirical distribution of
citations per author there exist two limits, in which the distribution appears
as a generalized Poisson and a power-law respectively. Our model successfully
reproduces the shape of the distribution, and provides an explanation for how
the shape emerges via the decisions of authors. The model also captures the
empirically positive correlations between the numbers of authors' papers,
citations and collaborators.

However, we often lack the ability to explain why a specific architecture
attains superior predictive accuracy for a given data set. Often, validation
accuracy is used as a performance heuristic quantifying how well a network
generalizes to unseen data, but it does not capture anything about the
information flow in the model. Mutual information can be used as a measure of
the quality of internal representations in deep learning models, and the
information plane may provide insights into whether the model exploits the
available information in the data. The information plane has previously been
explored for fully connected neural networks and convolutional architectures.
We present an architecture-agnostic method for tracking a network's internal
representations during training, which are then used to create the mutual
information plane. The method is exemplified for graph-based neural networks
fitted on citation data. We compare how the inductive bias introduced in
graph-based architectures changes the mutual information plane relative to a
fully connected neural network.

The main result of the study is that the altmetrics source that provides the

Classification based on Purpose competition. The goal of the competition is to
classify a citation in a scientific article based on its purpose. This task is
important because it could potentially lead to more comprehensive ways of
summarizing the purpose and uses of scientific articles, but it is also
difficult, mainly due to the limited amount of available training data in which
the purposes of each citation have been hand-labeled, along with the
subjectivity of these labels. Our entry in the competition is a multi-task

different perspectives, including hand-generated linguistic features, TF-IDF
features, and an LSTM-with-attention model. We also provide an ablation study

gnn_citations,graph neural networks for citation analysis,162,1603.08452,0.71414375,Citations: Indicators of Quality? The Impact Fallacy,cs.DL,"  We argue that citation is a composed indicator: short-term citations can be
considered as currency at the research front, whereas long-term citations can
contribute to the codification of knowledge claims into concept symbols.
Knowledge claims at the research front are more likely to be transitory and are
therefore problematic as indicators of quality. Citation impact studies focus
on short-term citation, and therefore tend to measure not epistemic quality,
but involvement in current discourses in which contributions are positioned by
referencing. We explore this argument using three case studies: (1) citations
of the journal Soziale Welt as an example of a venue that tends not to publish
papers at a research front, unlike, for example, JACS; (2) Robert Merton as a
concept symbol across theories of citation; and (3) the Multi-RPYS
(""Multi-Referenced Publication Year Spectroscopy"") of the journals
Scientometrics, Gene, and Soziale Welt. We show empirically that the
measurement of ""quality"" in terms of citations can further be qualified:
short-term citation currency at the research front can be distinguished from
longer-term processes of incorporation and codification of knowledge claims
into bodies of knowledge. The recently introduced Multi-RPYS can be used to
distinguish between short-term and long-term impacts.

by means of imitation. What makes a meme and what distinguishes it from other
forms of information, however, is still poorly understood. Our analysis of
memes in the scientific literature reveals that they are governed by a
surprisingly simple relationship between frequency of occurrence and the degree
to which they propagate along the citation graph. We propose a simple
formalization of this pattern and we validate it with data from close to 50
million publication records from the Web of Science, PubMed Central, and the
American Physical Society. Evaluations relying on human annotators, citation
network randomizations, and comparisons with several alternative approaches
confirm that our formula is accurate and effective, without a dependence on

the structure and development of scientific knowledge. We propose a new
measure, called intermediacy, for tracing the historical development of
scientific knowledge. Given two publications, an older and a more recent one,
intermediacy identifies publications that seem to play a major role in the
historical development from the older to the more recent publication. The
identified publications are important in connecting the older and the more
recent publication in the citation network. After providing a formal definition
of intermediacy, we study its mathematical properties. We then present two
empirical case studies, one tracing historical developments at the interface
between the community detection literature and the scientometric literature and
one examining the development of the literature on peer review. We show both
conceptually and empirically how intermediacy differs from main path analysis,
which is the most popular approach for tracing historical developments in
citation networks. Main path analysis tends to favor longer paths over shorter
ones, whereas intermediacy has the opposite tendency. Compared to main path
analysis, we conclude that intermediacy offers a more principled approach for
tracing the historical development of scientific knowledge.

goal is to record the state of the AA literature: who and how many of us are

in the form of numbers, graphs, and inter-connected visualizations. Special
emphasis is laid on the demographics and inclusiveness of NLP publishing.
Notably, we find that only about 30% of first authors are female, and that this
percentage has not improved since the year 2000. We also show that, on average,
female first authors are cited less than male first authors, even when

algorithm. We evaluated the task of finding the relevant documents for 25
systematic reviews. Our evaluation considered several trade-offs between recall
and precision for the cluster selection, and we also replicated the Boolean
queries self-reported by the systematic review to serve as a reference. We
found that citation-based clusters search performance is highly variable and
unpredictable, that it works best for users that prefer recall over precision
at a ratio between 2 and 8, and that when used along with query-based search
they complement each other, including finding new relevant documents.

For example, in a citation network, nodes representing ""Paper"" or ""Author"" may include attributes like keywords or affiliations. A critical machine learning task on these graphs is node classification, which is useful for applications such as fake news detection, corporate risk assessment, and molecular property prediction. Although Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) perform well in these contexts, their predictions remain opaque. Existing post-hoc explanation methods lack support for actual node features beyond one-hot encoding of node type and often fail to generate realistic, faithful explanations. To address these gaps, we propose DiGNNExplainer, a model-level explanation approach that synthesizes heterogeneous graphs with realistic node features via discrete denoising diffusion. In particular, we generate realistic discrete features (e.g., bag-of-words features) using diffusion models within a discrete space, whereas previous approaches are limited to continuous spaces. We evaluate our approach on multiple datasets and show that DiGNNExplainer produces explanations that are realistic and faithful to the model's decision-making, outperforming state-of-the-art methods."

  behaviour",cs.DL,"  Citations are a key indicator of research impact but are shaped by factors
beyond intrinsic research quality, including prestige, social networks, and
thematic similarity. While the Matthew Effect explains how prestige accumulates
and influences citation distributions, our study contextualizes this by showing
that other mechanisms also play a crucial role. Analyzing a large dataset of
disambiguated authors (N=43,467) and citation linkages (N=264,436) in U.S.
economics, we find that close ties in the collaboration network are the
strongest predictor of citation, closely followed by thematic similarity
between papers. This reinforces the idea that citations are not only a matter
of prestige but mostly of social networks and intellectual proximity. Prestige
remains important for understanding highly cited papers, but for the majority
of citations, proximity--both social and semantic--plays a more significant
role. These findings shift attention from extreme cases of highly cited
research toward the broader distribution of citations, which shapes career
trajectories and the production of knowledge. Recognizing the diverse factors
influencing citations is critical for science policy, as this work highlights
inequalities that are not based on preferential attachment, but on the role of
self-citations, collaborations, and mainstream versus no mainstream research
subjects.

of predicting long-term scientific impact (LTSI) usually measured by the number
of citations accumulated by a paper in the long-term. It is well known that
early citations (within 1-2 years after publication) acquired by a paper
positively affects its LTSI. However, there is no work that investigates if the
set of authors who bring in these early citations to a paper also affect its
LTSI. In this paper, we demonstrate for the first time, the impact of these
authors whom we call early citers (EC) on the LTSI of a paper. Note that this
study of the complex dynamics of EC introduces a brand new paradigm in citation
behavior analysis. Using a massive computer science bibliographic dataset we
identify two distinct categories of EC - we call those authors who have high
overall publication/citation count in the dataset as influential and the rest
of the authors as non-influential. We investigate three characteristic
properties of EC and present an extensive analysis of how each category
correlates with LTSI in terms of these properties. In contrast to popular
perception, we find that influential EC negatively affects LTSI possibly owing
to attention stealing. To motivate this, we present several representative
examples from the dataset. A closer inspection of the collaboration network
reveals that this stealing effect is more profound if an EC is nearer to the
authors of the paper being investigated. As an intuitive use case, we show that
incorporating EC properties in the state-of-the-art supervised citation
prediction models leads to high performance margins. At the closing, we present
an online portal to visualize EC statistics along with the prediction results
for a given query paper.

Anthology Collections (ACL-Embeddings). I also investigated polarity-specific
word embeddings (PS-Embeddings) for classifying positive and negative

positive and negative citations. However, hand-crafted features performed
better for the overall classification.

Such uses typically rely on raw citation counts and neglect variability in citation types. In particular, citations can vary in their fidelity as original knowledge from cited studies may be paraphrased, summarized, or reinterpreted, possibly wrongly, leading to variation in how much information changes from cited to citing paper. In this study, we introduce a computational pipeline to quantify citation fidelity at scale. Using full texts of papers, the pipeline identifies citations in citing papers and the corresponding claims in cited papers, and applies supervised models to measure fidelity at the sentence level. Analyzing a large-scale multi-disciplinary dataset of approximately 13 million citation sentence pairs, we find that citation fidelity is higher when authors cite papers that are 1) more recent and intellectually close, 2) more accessible, and 3) the first author has a lower H-index and the author team is medium-sized. Using a quasi-experiment, we establish the ""telephone effect"" - when citing papers have low fidelity to the original claim, future papers that cite the citing paper and the original have lower fidelity to the original. Our work reveals systematic differences in citation fidelity, underscoring the limitations of analyses that rely on citation quantity alone and the potential for distortion of evidence."

and citation counts of references. In general, the fields of Biomedical and
Health Sciences, Life and Earth Sciences, and Physical Sciences and Engineering
have similar reference distributions, although they vary in their specifics.
The two remaining fields, Mathematics and Computer Science and Social Science
and Humanities, have different reference distributions from the other three
fields and between themselves. We also show that in all fields the numbers of
sentences, references, and in-text mentions per article have increased over
time, and that there are field-level and temporal differences in the numbers of
in-text mentions per reference. A final finding is that references mentioned
only once tend to be much more highly cited than those mentioned multiple
times.

  Neural Networks: A Replicability Study",cs.IR,"  In the process of Systematic Literature Review, citation screening is
estimated to be one of the most time-consuming steps. Multiple approaches to
automate it using various machine learning techniques have been proposed. The
first research papers that apply deep neural networks to this problem were
published in the last two years. In this work, we conduct a replicability study
of the first two deep learning papers for citation screening and evaluate their
performance on 23 publicly available datasets. While we succeeded in
replicating the results of one of the papers, we were unable to replicate the
results of the other. We summarise the challenges involved in the replication,
including difficulties in obtaining the datasets to match the experimental
setup of the original papers and problems with executing the original source
code. Motivated by this experience, we subsequently present a simpler model
based on averaging word embeddings that outperforms one of the models on 18 out
of 23 datasets and is, on average, 72 times faster than the second replicated
approach. Finally, we measure the training time and the invariance of the
models when exposed to a variety of input features and random initialisations,
demonstrating differences in the robustness of these approaches.

  (2011-21): A Dynamic and Evolving Relationship",cs.DL,"  Differences between the impacts of Open Access (OA) and non-OA research have
been observed over a wide range of citation and altmetric indicators, usually
finding an Open Access Advantage (OAA) within specific fields. However,
science-wide analyses covering multiple years, indicators and disciplines are
lacking. Using citation counts and six altmetrics for 38.7M articles published
2011-21, we compare OA and non-OA papers. The results show that there is no
universal OAA across all disciplines or impact indicators: the OAA for
citations tends to be lower for more recent papers, whereas the OAAs for news,
blogs and Twitter are consistent across years and unrelated to volume of OA
publications, whereas the OAAs for Wikipedia, patents and policy citations are
more complex. These results support different hypotheses for different subjects
and indicators. The evidence is consistent with OA accelerating research impact
in the Medical & Health Sciences, Life Sciences and the Humanities; that
increased visibility or discoverability is a factor in promoting the
translation of research into socio-economic impact; and that OA is a factor in
growing online engagement with research in some disciplines. OAAs are therefore
complex, dynamic, multi-factorial and require considerable analysis to
understand.

gnn_citations,graph neural networks for citation analysis,180,2305.03589,0.7109759,Disruptive papers in science are losing impact,cs.DL physics.soc-ph,"  The impact and originality are two critical dimensions for evaluating
scientific publications, measured by citation and disruption metrics
respectively. Despite the extensive effort made to understand the statistical
properties and evolution of each of these metrics, the relations between the
two remain unclear. In this paper, we study the evolution during last 70 years
of the correlation between scientific papers' citation and disruption, finding
surprisingly a decreasing trend from positive to negative correlations over the
years. Consequently, during the years, there are fewer and fewer disruptive
works among the highly cited papers. These results suggest that highly
disruptive studies nowadays attract less attention from the scientific
community. The analysis on papers' references supports this trend, showing that
papers citing older references, less popular references and diverse references
become to have less citations. Possible explanations for the less attention
phenomenon could be due to the increasing information overload in science, and
citations become more and more prominent for impact. This is supported by the
evidence that research fields with more papers have a more negative correlation
between citation and disruption. Finally, we show the generality of our
findings by analyzing and comparing six disciplines.

Citations counts are often interpreted as proxies for the scientific influence
of papers, journals, scholars, and institutions. However, a rigorous and
scientifically grounded methodology for a correct use of citation counts is
still missing. In particular, cross-disciplinary comparisons in terms of raw
citation counts systematically favors scientific disciplines with higher
citation and publication rates. Here we perform an exhaustive study of the
citation patterns of millions of papers, and derive a simple transformation of
citation counts able to suppress the disproportionate citation counts among
scientific domains. We find that the transformation is well described by a
power-law function, and that the parameter values of the transformation are
typical features of each scientific discipline. Universal properties of
citation patterns descend therefore from the fact that citation distributions
for papers in a specific field are all part of the same family of univariate
distributions.

  understanding how citations are made",cs.DL cs.CL,"  Citation content analysis seeks to understand citations based on the language
used during the making of a citation. A key issue in citation content analysis
is looking for linguistic structures that characterize distinct classes of
citations for the purposes of understanding the intent and function of a
citation. Previous works have focused on modeling linguistic features first and
drawn conclusions on the language structures unique to each class of citation
function based on the performance of a classification task or inter-annotator
agreement. In this study, we start with a large sample of a pre-classified
citation corpus, 2 million citations from each class of the scite Smart
Citation dataset (supporting, disputing, and mentioning citations), and analyze
its corpus linguistics in order to reveal the unique and statistically
significant language structures belonging to each type of citation. By
generating comparison tables for each citation type we present a number of
interesting linguistic features that uniquely characterize citation type. What
we find is that within citation collocates, there is very low correlation
between citation type and sentiment. Additionally, we find that the
subjectivity of citation collocates across classes is very low. These findings
suggest that the sentiment of collocates is not a predictor of citation
function and that due to their low subjectivity, an opinion-expressing mode of
understanding citations, implicit in previous citation sentiment analysis
literature, is inappropriate. Instead, we suggest that citations can be better
understood as claims-making devices where the citation type can be explained by
understanding how two claims are being compared. By presenting this approach,
we hope to inspire similar corpus linguistic studies on citations that derive a
more robust theory of citation from an empirical basis using citation corpora

fuzzy. Institutional units of analysis and persons may move between fields or
span different specialties. The match between the citation index and
institutional profiles varies among institutional units and nations. The
respective matches may heavily affect the representation of the units. Non-ISI

This study evaluates the performance of these clustering algorithms on a citation graph comprising approx. 700,000 papers and 4.6 million citations extracted from Web of Science. The results show that while scalable methods like Louvain and Leiden perform efficiently, their default settings often yield poor partitioning.

journal in academia. The number of citations received by a journal is a crucial
factor in determining the impact factor, which may be misused in multiple ways.
Therefore, it is crucial to detect citation anomalies for further identifying
manipulation and inflation of impact factor. Citation network models the
citation relationship between journals in terms of a directed graph. Detecting
anomalies in the citation network is a challenging task which has several
applications in spotting citation cartels and citation stack and understanding
the intentions behind the citations. In this paper, we present a novel approach
to detect the anomalies in a journal-level scientific citation network, and
compare the results with the existing graph anomaly detection algorithms. Due
to the lack of proper ground-truth, we introduce a journal-level citation
anomaly dataset which consists of synthetically injected citation anomalies and
use it to evaluate our methodology. Our method is able to predict the anomalous
citation pairs with a precision of 100\% and an F1-score of 86%. We further
categorize the detected anomalies into various types and reason out possible
causes. We also analyze our model on the Microsoft Academic Search dataset - a
real-world citation dataset and interpret our results using a case study,
wherein our results resemble the citations and SCImago Journal Rank (SJR)
rating-change charts, thus indicating the usefulness of our method. We further
design `Journal Citation Analysis Tool', an interactive web portal which, given
the citation network as an input, shows the journal-level anomalous citation
patterns and helps users analyze citation patterns of a given journal over the

general and observations of the domain in particular. Fitness variables based
on prior impacts and the time factor have significant influences on citation
outcomes. We find considerably large effect sizes from the fitness modeling,
which suggest inevitable bias in citation analysis due to these factors. While
raw citation scores offer little insight into the growth of InfoVis,
normalization of the scores by influences of time and prior fitness offers a
reasonable depiction of the field's development. The analysis demonstrates the
proposed model's ability to produce results consistent with observed data and
to support meaningful comparison of citation scores over time.

representation that encodes coupled author-paper networks as a weighted

that captures the emergence of a new field of science and comprises 614 papers
published by 1,036 unique authors between 1974 and 2004. In order to
characterize the properties and evolution of this field we first use four
different measures of centrality to identify the impact of authors. A global
statistical analysis is performed to characterize the distribution of paper
production and paper citations and its correlation with the co-authorship team
size. The size of co-authorship clusters over time is examined. Finally, a
novel local, author-centered measure based on entropy is applied to determine
the global evolution of the field and the identification of the contribution of
a single author's impact across all of its co-authorship relations. A
visualization of the growth of the weighted co-author network and the results
obtained from the statistical analysis indicate a drift towards a more
cooperative, global collaboration process as the main drive in the production
of scientific knowledge.

Scientific fields such as scientometrics, informetrics and bibliometrics

In this area, an important problem is to predict the future influence of a

of the most important metrics is the number of citations to the paper, since
this metric is widely utilized in the evaluation of scientific publications and
moreover, it serves as the basis for many other metrics such as h-index. In
this paper, we propose a novel method for predicting long-term citations of a

artificial neural networks which is a powerful machine learning tool with

representing a novel combination of existing ideas evolves towards a specialty.
The strength of co-citation is represented by its frequency, which accumulates
over time. Of interest is whether underlying features associated with the
strength of co-citation can be identified. We use the proximal citation network
for a given pair of articles (x, y) to compute theta, an a priori estimate of
the probability of co-citation between x and y, prior to their first
co-citation.Thus, low values for theta reflect pairs of articles for which
co-citation is presumed less likely. We observe that co-citation frequencies
are a composite of power-law and lognormal distributions, and that very high
co-citation frequencies are more likely to be composed of pairs with low values
of theta, reflecting the impact of a novel combination of ideas. Furthermore,
we note that the occurrence of a direct citation between two members of a
co-cited pair increases with co-citation frequency. Finally, we identify cases
of frequently co-cited publications that accumulate co-citations after an
extended period of dormancy.

random walk on a graph produces a machine-readable record, and this record is
processed by a deep neural network to directly make vertex-level or graph-level
predictions. We call these stochastic machines random walk neural networks
(RWNNs), and through principled analysis, show that we can design them to be
isomorphism invariant while capable of universal approximation of graph
functions in probability. A useful finding is that almost any kind of record of
random walks guarantees probabilistic invariance as long as the vertices are
anonymized. This enables us, for example, to record random walks in plain text
and adopt a language model to read these text records to solve graph tasks. We
further establish a parallelism to message passing neural networks using tools
from Markov chain theory, and show that over-smoothing in message passing is
alleviated by construction in RWNNs, while over-squashing manifests as
probabilistic under-reaching. We empirically demonstrate RWNNs on a range of

the use of citations for research evaluation. However, a consensus has yet to
be established concerning the historical trends in citation concentration. Are
citations becoming more concentrated in a small number of articles? Or have
recent geopolitical and technical changes in science led to more decentralized
distributions? This ongoing debate stems from a lack of technical clarity in
measuring inequality. Given the variations in citation practices across
disciplines and over time, it is crucial to account for multiple factors that
can influence the findings. This article explores how reference-based and
citation-based approaches, uncited articles, citation inflation, the expansion
of bibliometric databases, disciplinary differences, and self-citations affect
the evolution of citation concentration. Our results indicate a decreasing
trend in citation concentration, primarily driven by a decline in uncited
articles, which, in turn, can be attributed to the growing significance of Asia
and Europe. On the whole, our findings clarify current debates on citation

terms of citation counts. However, scientific activity has moved online over
the past decade. To better capture scientific impact in the digital era, a
variety of new impact measures has been proposed on the basis of social network
analysis and usage log data. Here we investigate how these new measures relate
to each other, and how accurately and completely they express scientific
impact. We performed a principal component analysis of the rankings produced by
39 existing and proposed measures of scholarly impact that were calculated on
the basis of both citation and usage log data. Our results indicate that the
notion of scientific impact is a multi-dimensional construct that can not be
adequately measured by any single indicator, although some measures are more
suitable than others. The commonly used citation Impact Factor is not
positioned at the core of this construct, but at its periphery, and should thus
be used with caution.

  Access Citation Advantage",cs.DL,"  The existence of an open access (OA) citation advantage, that is, whether OA
increases citations, has been a topic of interest for many years. Although
numerous previous studies have focused on whether OA increases citations,
expectations for OA go beyond that. One such expectation is the promotion of
knowledge transfer across various fields. This study aimed to clarify whether
OA, especially gold OA, increases interdisciplinary citations in various
natural science fields. Specifically, we measured the effect of OA on
interdisciplinary and within-discipline citation counts by decomposing an
existing metric of the OA citation advantage. The results revealed that OA
increases both interdisciplinary and within-discipline citations in many fields
and increases only interdisciplinary citations in chemistry, computer science,
and clinical medicine. Among these fields, clinical medicine tends to obtain
more interdisciplinary citations without being influenced by specific journals
or papers. The findings indicate that OA fosters knowledge transfer to
different fields, which extends our understanding of its effects.

international community of researchers working in Bibliometrics,
Scientometrics, Informetrics, Webometrics, and Altmetrics was selected as a
case study. The records of the top 1,000 most cited documents by these authors
according to GSC were manually processed to fill any missing information and
deduplicate fields like the journal titles and book publishers. The results
suggest that it is feasible to use GSC and the MADAP method to produce an
accurate depiction of the community of researchers working in Bibliometrics

(main publication venues such as journals and book publishers). Additionally,
the wide document coverage of Google Scholar (specially books and book

the academic community. Self-citations support research continuity but, if
excessive, may inflate metrics and raise bias concerns. The aim of the study is
to examine the role of self-citations towards the research impact of India. To
study this, 3.58 million papers affiliated with India from 1947 to 2024 in the
Scopus database were downloaded, and 2.96 million were filtered according to
document type and publication year up to 2023. Further filtering based on high
citation counts identified the top 1% of highly cited papers, totaling 29,556.
The results indicate that the impact of Indian research, measured by highly
cited papers, has grown exponentially since 2000, reaching a peak during the
2011-2020 decade. Among the citations received by these 29,556 papers, 6% are
self-citations. Papers with a high proportion of self-citations (>90%) are
predominantly from recent decades and are associated with smaller team sizes.
The findings also reveal that smaller teams are primarily domestic, whereas
larger teams are more likely to involve international collaborations. Domestic
collaborations dominate smaller team sizes in terms of both self-citations and
publications, whereas international collaborations gain prominence as team
sizes increase. The results indicate that while domestic collaborations produce
a higher number of highly cited papers, international collaborations are more
likely to generate self-citations. The top international collaborators in
highly cited papers are the USA, followed by UK, and Germany.

larger size-dependent cumulative advantage for receiving citations than
top-performance groups. Furthermore, regardless of performance, larger groups
have less not-cited publications. Particularly for the lower performance groups
the fraction of not-cited publications decreases considerably with size. These
phenomena can be explained with a model in which self-citation acts as a
promotion mechanism for external citations. In this article we show that for
self-citations similar size-dependent scaling rules apply as for citations but
generally the power law exponents are higher for self-citations as compared to
citations. We also find that the fraction of self-citations is smaller for the
higher performance groups and this fraction decreases more rapidly with
increasing journal impact than for lower performance groups. An interesting
novel finding is that the variance in the correlation of the number of
self-citations with size is considerably less than the variance for external
citations. This is a clear indication that size is a stronger determinant for
self-citations than for external citations. Both higher and particularly lower
performance groups have a size-dependent cumulative advantage for
self-citations, but for the higher performance groups only in the lower impact
journals and in fields with low citation density.

publications every year. Among the many quantification measures of scientific
impact, citation count stands out for its frequent use in the research
community. Although peer review process is the mainly reliable way of
predicting a paper's future impact, the ability to foresee lasting impact on
the basis of citation records is increasingly important in the scientific
impact analysis in the era of big data. This paper focuses on the long-term
citation count prediction for individual publications, which has become an
emerging and challenging applied research topic. Based on the four key
phenomena confirmed independently in previous studies of long-term scientific
impact quantification, including the intrinsic quality of publications, the
aging effect and the Matthew effect and the recency effect, we unify the
formulations of all these observations in this paper. Building on a foundation
of the above formulations, we propose a long-term citation count prediction
model for individual papers via recurrent neural network with long short-term
memory units. Extensive experiments on a real-large citation data set
demonstrate that the proposed model consistently outperforms existing methods,
and achieves a significant performance improvement.

eliminating the use of GNNs at test time but they still require them during

method consists of three key components: smoothness constraints,
pseudo-labeling iterations and neighborhood-label histograms. Our final
approach can match the state-of-the-art accuracy on standard popular benchmarks
such as citation and co-purchase networks, without training a GNN.

descriptions, facilitating detailed depictions of data and their
interconnections across various real-world settings. However, existing TAG
datasets predominantly feature textual information only at the nodes, with
edges typically represented by mere binary or categorical attributes. This lack
of rich textual edge annotations significantly limits the exploration of
contextual relationships between entities, hindering deeper insights into
graph-structured data. To address this gap, we introduce Textual-Edge Graphs
Datasets and Benchmark (TEG-DB), a comprehensive and diverse collection of
benchmark textual-edge datasets featuring rich textual descriptions on nodes
and edges. The TEG-DB datasets are large-scale and encompass a wide range of
domains, from citation networks to social networks. In addition, we conduct
extensive benchmark experiments on TEG-DB to assess the extent to which current
techniques, including pre-trained language models, graph neural networks, and
their combinations, can utilize textual node and edge information. Our goal is
to elicit advancements in textual-edge graph research, specifically in
developing methodologies that exploit rich textual node and edge descriptions
to enhance graph analysis and provide deeper insights into complex real-world
networks. The entire TEG-DB project is publicly accessible as an open-source

because each self-citation adds to the numerator, whereas the denominator is
not affected. Pinski & Narin (1976) derived the Influence Weight (IW) as an
alternative to Garfield's JIF. Whereas the JIF is based on raw citation counts
normalized by the number of publications, IWs are based on the eigenvectors in
the matrix of aggregated journal-journal citations without a reference to size:
the cited and citing sides are combined by a matrix approach. IWs emerge as a
vector after recursive iteration of the normalized matrix. Before recursion, IW
is a (vector-based) non-network indicator of impact, but after recursion (i.e.
repeated improvement by iteration), IWs can be considered a network measure of
prestige among the journals in the (sub)graph as a representation of a field of
science. As a consequence (not intended by Pinski & Narin in 1976), the
self-citations are integrated at the field level and no longer disturb the
analysis as outliers. In our opinion, this is a very desirable property of a
measure of quality or impact. As illustrations, we use data of journal citation
matrices already studied in the literature, and also the complete set of data
in the Journal Citation Reports 2017 (n = 11,579 journals). The values of IWs
are sometimes counter-intuitive and difficult to interpret. Furthermore,
iterations do not always converge. Routines for the computation of IWs are made
available at http://www.leydesdorff.net/iw.

examine the changes in key input indicators and their patterns over different

Here I briefly review part of the discussion in research evaluation. This also touches on the subject of how citations relate to peer review. Finally, I conclude by trying to integrate the two literatures. The fundamental problem in research evaluation is that research quality is unobservable. This has consequences for conclusions that we can draw from quantitative studies of citations and citation models. The term ``indicators'' is a relevant concept in this context, which I try to clarify. Causality is important for properly understanding indicators, especially when indicators are used in practice: when we act on indicators, we enter causal territory. Even when an indicator might have been valid, through its very use, the consequences of its use may invalidate it. By combining citation models with proper causal reasoning and acknowledging the fundamental problem about unobservable research quality, we may hope to make progress."

structural features within dynamic heterogeneous graphs derived from the
citation networks and applies various auxiliary tasks for disentanglement. By
emphasizing comparative and co-cited/citing information and aggregating
snapshots evolutionarily, DPPDCC captures knowledge flow within the citation
network. Afterwards, popularity is outlined by contrasting augmented graphs to
extract the essence of citation diffusion and predicting citation accumulation
bins for quantitative conformity modeling. Orthogonal constraints ensure
distinct modeling of each perspective, preserving the contribution value. To
gauge generalization across publication times and replicate the realistic

GLAD incorporates text semantic mining to network representation learning by
adding both node attributes and link attributes via graph neural networks. It
exploits not only the relevance of citation contents but also hidden

They combine structural topology with node attributes through message passing and pooling. However, their robustness or lack of thereof with respect to different perturbations and targeted attacks in conjunction with community detection tasks is not well understood. To shed light into latent mechanisms behind GNN sensitivity on community detection tasks, we conduct a systematic computational evaluation of six widely adopted GNN architectures: GCN, GAT, Graph-SAGE, DiffPool, MinCUT, and DMoN. The analysis covers three perturbation categories: node attribute manipulations, edge topology distortions, and adversarial attacks. We use element-centric similarity as the evaluation metric on synthetic benchmarks and real-world citation networks. Our findings indicate that supervised GNNs tend to achieve higher baseline accuracy, while unsupervised methods, particularly DMoN, maintain stronger resilience under targeted and adversarial perturbations. Furthermore, robustness appears to be strongly influenced by community strength, with well-defined communities reducing performance loss. Across all models, node attribute perturbations associated with targeted edge deletions and shift in attribute distributions tend to cause the largest degradation in community recovery. These findings highlight important trade-offs between accuracy and robustness in GNN-based community detection and offer new insights into selecting architectures resilient to noise and adversarial attacks."

Several citation factors have been studied in the literature. In this study we

because a high growth in a topic means there are more publications citing

the association between topic growth and citation counts in eight broad
disciplines. The first part of the model uses quantile regression to estimate
the effect of growth ratio on citation counts for publications with more than

the influence of the explanatory variables on the probability of being lowly
cited versus being modestly or highly cited. Both models control for three
variables that may distort the association between the topic growth and
citations: journal impact, number of references, and number of authors. The
regression model clearly shows that publications in fast-growing topics have a
citation advantage compared to publications in slow-growing or declining topics
in all of the eight disciplines. Using citation indicators for research
evaluation may give incentives for researchers to publish in fast-growing
topics, but they may cause research to be less diversified. The results have
also some implications for citation normalization.

by the approximation strategy to address the challenges of local optimum of
classic and fractional graph neural networks which are specialised at
aggregating information from the feature and adjacent matrices of connected
nodes and their neighbours to solve learning tasks on non-Euclidean data such
as graphs. Meanwhile the approximate calculation of fractional order gradients
also overcomes the high computational complexity of fractional order
derivations. We further prove that such an approximation is feasible and the
FGNN is unbiased towards global optimization solution. Extensive experiments on
citation networks show that FGNN achieves great advantage over baseline models
when selected appropriate fractional order.

lately have turned into widely used and misused measures of scientific impact.
Yet, when a discovery becomes common knowledge, citations suffer from
obliteration by incorporation. This leads to the concept of hidden citation,
representing a clear textual credit to a discovery without a reference to the
publication embodying it. Here, we rely on unsupervised interpretable machine
learning applied to the full text of each paper to systematically identify
hidden citations. We find that for influential discoveries hidden citations
outnumber citation counts, emerging regardless of publishing venue and
discipline. We show that the prevalence of hidden citations is not driven by
citation counts, but rather by the degree of the discourse on the topic within
the text of the manuscripts, indicating that the more discussed is a discovery,
the less visible it is to standard bibliometric analysis. Hidden citations
indicate that bibliometric measures offer a limited perspective on quantifying
the true impact of a discovery, raising the need to extract knowledge from the
full text of the scientific corpus.

sources are seen as concept symbols of research fronts. But instead of co-cited
sources I cluster citation links, which are the thematically least heterogenous
elements in bibliometric studies. To obtain clusters representing topics
characterised by concepts I restrict link clustering to citation links to
highly cited sources. Clusters of citation links between papers in a
political-science subfield (International Relations) and 300 of their sources
most cited in the period 2006-2015 are constructed by a local memetic
algorithm. It finds local minima in a cost landscape corresponding to clusters,
which can overlap each other pervasively. The clusters obtained are well
separated from the rest of the network but can have suboptimal cohesion.
Cohesive cores of topics are found by applying an algorithm that constructs
core-periphery structures in link sets. In this methodological paper I only
discuss some first clustering results for the second half of the 10-years

title, authors, publication year and journal name and uses the results for the
widest published correlation analysis of Microsoft Academic citation counts for
journal articles so far. Based on 126,312 articles from 323 Scopus subfields in
2012, the optimal strategy to find articles with DOIs is to search for them by
title and filter out those with incorrect DOIs. This finds 90% of journal
articles. For articles without DOIs, the optimal strategy is to search for them
by title and then filter out matches with dissimilar metadata. This finds 89%
of journal articles, with an additional 1% incorrect matches. The remaining
articles seem to be mainly not indexed by Microsoft Academic or indexed with a
different language version of their title. From the matches, Scopus citation

citation index which simultaneously assigns scores to both authors and papers.
Using these scores, we can get an objective measure of the reputation of an

  We model this problem as an iterative computation on a publication graph,
whose vertices are authors and papers, and whose edges indicate which author
has written which paper. We prove that this iterative computation converges in
the limit, by using a powerful theorem from linear algebra. We run this
algorithm on several examples, and find that the author and paper scores match
closely with what is suggested by our intuition. The algorithm is theoretically
sound and runs very fast in practice. We compare this index with several
existing metrics and find that CITEX gives far more accurate scores compared to
the traditional metrics.

This paper investigates how citations to retracted research are handled on English Wikipedia. We construct a novel dataset that integrates Wikipedia revision histories with metadata from Retraction Watch, Crossref, Altmetric, and OpenAlex, identifying 1,181 citations of retracted papers. We find that 71.6% of all citations analyzed are problematic. These are citations added before a paper's retraction, as well as the citations introduced after retraction without any in-text mention of the paper's retracted status. Our analysis reveals that these citations persist for a median of over 3.68 years (1,344 days). Through survival analysis, we find that signals of human attention are associated with a faster correction process. Unfortunately, a paper's established scholarly authority, a higher academic citation count, is associated with a slower time to correction. Our findings highlight how the Wikipedia community supports collaborative maintenance but leaves gaps in citation-level repair. We contribute to CSCW research by advancing our understanding of this sociotechnical vulnerability, which takes the form of a community coordination challenge, and by offering design directions to support citation credibility at scale."

citation network (1926-2010) to test our ability to early identify a list of
historically significant patents through citation network analysis. We show
that in order to effectively uncover these patents shortly after they are
issued, we need to go beyond raw citation counts and take into account both the
citation network topology and temporal information. In particular, an
age-normalized measure of patent centrality, called rescaled PageRank, allows
us to identify the significant patents earlier than citation count and PageRank
score. In addition, we find that while high-impact patents tend to rely on
other high-impact patents in a similar way as scientific papers, the patents'
citation dynamics is significantly slower than that of papers, which makes the
early identification of significant patents more challenging than that of
significant papers.

ranks (e.g., top-1%, top-10%, etc.), an integrated impact indicator (I3) can be
based on integration of the citation curves, but after normalization of the
citation curves to the same scale. The results across document sets can be
compared as percentages of the total impact of a reference set. Total number of
citations, however, should not be used instead because the shape of the

there remains a significant gap in understanding the quality of the

well-curated academic datasets. To address this gap, we propose here the first
comprehensive benchmarking of various unsupervised node embedding techniques

sensitivity of current methods to hyperparameter choices -- highlighting a
fundamental issue as to their applicability in real-world settings where there
is no established methodology for rigorous hyperparameter selection. Addressing
this issue, we introduce GNUMAP, a robust and parameter-free method for
unsupervised node representation learning that merges the traditional UMAP

Citation prediction is particularly critical for newborn papers, where early assessment must be performed without citation signals and under highly long-tailed distributions. We identify two key research gaps: (i) insufficient modeling of implicit factors of scientific impact, leading to reliance on coarse proxies; and (ii) a lack of bias-aware learning that can deliver stable predictions on lowly cited papers. We address these gaps by proposing a Bias-Aware Citation Prediction Framework, which combines multi-agent feature extraction with robust graph representation learning. First, a multi-agent x graph co-learning module derives fine-grained, interpretable signals, such as reproducibility, collaboration network, and text quality, from metadata and external resources, and fuses them with heterogeneous-network embeddings to provide rich supervision even in the absence of early citation signals. Second, we incorporate a set of robust mechanisms: a two-stage forward process that routes explicit factors through an intermediate exposure estimate, GroupDRO to optimize worst-case group risk across environments, and a regularization head that performs what-if analyses on controllable factors under monotonicity and smoothness constraints. Comprehensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model. Specifically, our model achieves around a 13% reduction in error metrics (MALE and RMSLE) and a notable 5.5% improvement in the ranking metric (NDCG) over the baseline methods."

This paper introduces the Self-Citation Adjusted Index (SCAI), a sophisticated metric designed to recalibrate citation counts by accounting for discipline-specific self-citation patterns. Through comprehensive analysis of 5,000 researcher profiles across diverse disciplines, we demonstrate that excessive self-citation inflates traditional metrics by 10-20%, potentially misdirecting billions in research funding. Recent studies confirm that self-citation patterns exhibit significant gender disparities, with men self-citing up to 70% more frequently than women, exacerbating existing inequalities in academic recognition. Our open-source implementation provides comprehensive tools for calculating SCAI and related metrics, offering a more equitable assessment of research impact that reduces the gender citation gap by approximately 8.5%.

the dyadic fairness of GNN link prediction, the within-group (e.g., queer

underexplored. However, these aspects have significant consequences for degree
and power imbalances in networks. In this paper, we shed light on how degree
bias in networks affects Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) link prediction. In
particular, we theoretically uncover that GCNs with a symmetric normalized
graph filter have a within-group preferential attachment bias. We validate our
theoretical analysis on real-world citation, collaboration, and online social
networks. We further bridge GCN's preferential attachment bias with unfairness
in link prediction and propose a new within-group fairness metric. This metric
quantifies disparities in link prediction scores within social groups, towards
combating the amplification of degree and power disparities. Finally, we
propose a simple training-time strategy to alleviate within-group unfairness,

Their work uses neural networks and attribution techniques to guide human intuition towards making provable conjectures. Here, we build upon this framework to develop a method for identifying sufficient conditions that imply a given mathematical statement. Our approach trains neural networks with a custom loss function that prioritizes high precision. Then uses attribution techniques and exploratory data analysis to make conjectures. As a demonstration, we apply this process to Stanley's problem of $e$-positivity of graphs--a problem that has been at the center of algebraic combinatorics for the past three decades. Guided by AI, we rediscover that one sufficient condition for a graph to be $e$-positive is that it is co-triangle-free, and that the number of claws is the most important factor for $e$-positivity. Based on the most important factors in Saliency Map analysis of neural networks, we suggest that the classification of $e$-positive graphs is more related to continuous graph invariants rather than the discrete ones. Furthermore, using neural networks and exploratory data analysis, we show that the claw-free and claw-contractible-free graphs with $10$ and $11$ vertices are $e$-positive, resolving a conjecture by Dahlberg, Foley, and van Willigenburg."

that for reasonably well cited papers this distribution is well fitted by a
lognormal with a variance of around 1.3 which is consistent with the results of
Radicchi, Fortunato, and Castellano (2008). Our work demonstrates that
comparisons can be made between publications from different disciplines and
publication dates, regardless of their citation count and without expensive
access to the whole world-wide citation graph. Further, it shows that averages

combined. A common argument against the use of indicators in such research
evaluation exercises is their low correlation at the article level with peer
review judgments. In this study, we analyse 191,000 papers from 154 higher
education institutes which were peer reviewed in a national research evaluation
exercise. We combine these data with 6.95 million citations to the original
papers. We show that when citation-based indicators are applied at the
institutional or departmental level, rather than at the level of individual
papers, surprisingly large correlations with peer review judgments can be
observed, up to r <= 0.802, n = 37, p < 0.001 for some disciplines. In our
evaluation of ranking prediction performance based on citation data, we show we
can reduce the mean rank prediction error by 25% compared to previous work.
This suggests that citation-based indicators are sufficiently aligned with peer

burden of peer review on national evaluation exercises leading to considerable
cost savings.

four diverse GNN explanation evaluation regimes -- 1) faithfulness, 2)

neural network operations in Euclidean space, which do not explicitly capture
the tree-like hierarchical structure exhibited in real-world datasets that
modeled as graphs. In this paper, we attempt to introduce hyperbolic space into
linear GCN and propose a novel framework for Lorentzian linear GCN.
Specifically, we map the learned features of graph nodes into hyperbolic space,
and then perform a Lorentzian linear feature transformation to capture the
underlying tree-like structure of data. Experimental results on standard
citation networks datasets with semi-supervised learning show that our approach
yields new state-of-the-art results of accuracy 74.7$\%$ on Citeseer and
81.3$\%$ on PubMed datasets. Furthermore, we observe that our approach can be
trained up to two orders of magnitude faster than other nonlinear GCN models on
PubMed dataset. Our code is publicly available at

  three altmetrics",cs.DL physics.soc-ph,"  Alternative metrics are currently one of the most popular research topics in
scientometric research. This paper provides an overview of research into three
of the most important altmetrics: microblogging (Twitter), online reference
managers (Mendeley and CiteULike) and blogging. The literature is discussed in
relation to the possible use of altmetrics in research evaluation. Since the
research was particularly interested in the correlation between altmetrics
counts and citation counts, this overview focuses particularly on this
correlation. For each altmetric, a meta-analysis is calculated for its
correlation with traditional citation counts. As the results of the
meta-analyses show, the correlation with traditional citations for
micro-blogging counts is negligible (pooled r=0.003), for blog counts it is
small (pooled r=0.12) and for bookmark counts from online reference managers,
medium to large (CiteULike pooled r=0.23; Mendeley pooled r=0.51).

are created in large social networks. In this work, we look at a sample of
relevant scientific publications in the area of high-frequency analog circuit
design and their citation distribution. A novel aspect of our work is the way
in which we categorize citations based on the reason and place of it in a
publication. We created seven citation categories from general domain
references, references to specific methods used in the same domain problem,
references to an analysis method, references for experimental comparison and so
on. This added information allows us to define two new measures to characterize
the creativity (novelty and usefulness) of a publication based on its pattern
of citations clustered by reason, place and citing scientific group. We
analyzed 30 publications in relevant journals since 2000 and their about 300
citations, all in the area of high-frequency analog circuit design. We observed
that the number of citations a publication receives from different scientific
groups matches a Levy type distribution: with a large number of groups citing a
publication relatively few times, and a very small number of groups citing a
publication a large number of times. We looked at the motifs a publication is
cited differently by different scientific groups.

particularly in ensuring the factual accuracy and reliability of the generated
outputs. Current methods for citation or attribution, such as those employed by
tools like Perplexity.ai and Bing Search-integrated LLMs, attempt to ground
responses by providing real-time search results and citations. However, so far,
these approaches suffer from issues such as hallucinations, biases,
surface-level relevance matching, and the complexity of managing vast,
unfiltered knowledge sources. While tools like Perplexity.ai dynamically
integrate web-based information and citations, they often rely on inconsistent
sources such as blog posts or unreliable sources, which limits their overall
reliability. We present that these challenges can be mitigated by integrating
Neurosymbolic AI (NesyAI), which combines the strengths of neural networks with
structured symbolic reasoning. NesyAI offers transparent, interpretable, and
dynamic reasoning processes, addressing the limitations of current attribution
methods by incorporating structured symbolic knowledge with flexible,
neural-based learning. This paper explores how NesyAI frameworks can enhance
existing attribution models, offering more reliable, interpretable, and
adaptable systems for LLMs.

  papers because their quality increases with collaboration? An analysis based
  on data from F1000Prime and normalized citation scores",cs.DL physics.soc-ph,"  In recent years, the relationship of collaboration among scientists and the
citation impact of papers have been frequently investigated. Most of the
studies show that the two variables are closely related: an increasing
collaboration activity (measured in terms of number of authors, number of
affiliations, and number of countries) is associated with an increased citation
impact. However, it is not clear whether the increased citation impact is based
on the higher quality of papers which profit from more than one scientist
giving expert input or other (citation-specific) factors. Thus, the current
study addresses this question by using two comprehensive datasets with
publications (in the biomedical area) including quality assessments by experts
(F1000Prime member scores) and citation data for the publications. The study is
based on nearly 10,000 papers. Robust regression models are used to investigate
the relationship between number of authors, number of affiliations, and number
of countries, respectively, and citation impact - controlling for the papers'
quality (measured by F1000Prime expert ratings). The results point out that the
effect of collaboration activities on impact is largely independent of the
papers' quality. The citation advantage is apparently not quality-related;
citation specific factors (e.g. self-citations) seem to be important here.

can serve as early signs for predicting delayed recognized knowledge in science
using a comparative study with a control group, i.e., instant recognition
papers. We identify the two opposite groups of papers by the Bcp measure, a
parameter-free index for identifying papers which were recognized with delay.
We provide a macro (Science/Nature papers dataset) and micro (a case chosen
from the dataset) evidence on paper-patent citation linkages as early signs for
predicting delayed recognized knowledge in science. It appears that papers with
delayed recognition show a stronger and longer technical impact than instant
recognition papers. We provide indication that in the more recent years papers
with delayed recognition are awakened more often and earlier by a patent rather
than by a scientific paper (also called ""prince""). We also found that patent
citations seem to play an important role to avoid instant recognition papers to
level off or to become a so called ""flash in the pan"", i.e., instant
recognition. It also appears that the sleeping beauties may firstly encounter
negative citations and then patent citations and finally get widely recognized.
In contrast to the two focused fields (biology and chemistry) for instant
recognition papers, delayed recognition papers are rather evenly distributed in
biology, chemistry, psychology, geology, materials science, and physics. We
discovered several pairs of ""science sleeping""-""technology [...]. We propose in
further research to discover the potential ahead of time and transformative
research by using citation delay analysis, patent & NPL analysis, and citation

Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have excelled at understanding natural language and integrating cross-modal signals, sparking interest in their potential for graph reasoning. Recent work has explored this by either designing template-based graph templates or using graph neural networks (GNNs) to encode structural information. In this study, we investigate how different strategies for encoding graph structure affect LLM performance on text-attributed graphs. Surprisingly, our systematic experiments reveal that: (i) LLMs leveraging only node textual descriptions already achieve strong performance across tasks; and (ii) most structural encoding strategies offer marginal or even negative gains. We show that explicit structural priors are often unnecessary and, in some cases, counterproductive when powerful language models are involved. This represents a significant departure from traditional graph learning paradigms and highlights the need to rethink how structure should be represented and utilized in the LLM era. Our study is to systematically challenge the foundational assumption that structure is inherently beneficial for LLM-based graph reasoning, opening the door to new, semantics-driven approaches for graph learning."

bibliometric data across disciplines and over time. The resulting figures can
be intuitively interpreted and are more suitable for detailed analysis of the
effects of independent and control variables on distributions than regression
analysis. We show this by using percentile shares to analyze so-called ""factors
influencing citation impact"" (FICs; e.g., the impact factor of the publishing
journal) across year and disciplines. All articles (n= 2,961,789) covered by
WoS in 1990 (n= 637,301), 2000 (n= 919,485), and 2010 (n= 1,405,003) are used.
In 2010, nearly half of the citation impact is accounted for by the 10%
most-frequently cited papers; the skewness is largest in the humanities (68.5%
in the top-10% layer) and lowest in agricultural sciences (40.6%). The
comparison of the effects of the different FICs (the number of cited
references, number of authors, number of pages, and JIF) on citation impact
shows that JIF has indeed the strongest correlations with the citation scores.
However, the correlation between FICs and citation impact is lower, if
citations are normalized instead of using raw citation counts.

better ranking of Web pages. It ranks documents depending on the topology of
the graphs and the weights of the nodes. PageRank has significantly advanced
the field of information retrieval and keeps Google ahead of competitors in the
search engine market. It has been deployed in bibliometrics to evaluate
research impact, yet few of these studies focus on the important impact of the
damping factor (d) for ranking purposes. This paper studies how varied damping
factors in the PageRank algorithm can provide additional insight into the
ranking of authors in an author co-citation network. Furthermore, we propose
weighted PageRank algorithms. We select 108 most highly cited authors in the
information retrieval (IR) area from the 1970s to 2008 to form the author
co-citation network. We calculate the ranks of these 108 authors based on
PageRank with damping factor ranging from 0.05 to 0.95. In order to test the
relationship between these different measures, we compare PageRank and weighted
PageRank results with the citation ranking, h-index, and centrality measures.
We found that in our author co-citation network, citation rank is highly
correlated with PageRank's with different damping factors and also with
different PageRank algorithms; citation rank and PageRank are not significantly
correlated with centrality measures; and h-index is not significantly
correlated with centrality measures.

social relations of their authors? To answer this question, we present a
data-driven analysis of nine different physics journals. Our analysis is based
on a two-layer network representation constructed from two large-scale data
sets, INSPIREHEP and APS. The social layer contains authors as nodes and
coauthorship relations as links. This allows us to quantify the social
relations of each author, prior to the publication of a new paper. The
publication layer contains papers as nodes and citations between papers as
links. This layer allows us to quantify scientific attention as measured by the
change of the citation rate over time. We particularly study how this change
depends on the social relations of their authors, prior to publication. We find
that on average the maximum value of the citation rate is reached sooner for
authors who either published more papers, or who had more coauthors in previous
papers. We also find that for these authors the decay in the citation rate is
faster, meaning that their papers are forgotten sooner.

  GNNs",cs.LG,"  When training a Neural Network, it is optimized using the available training
data with the hope that it generalizes well to new or unseen testing data. At
the same absolute value, a flat minimum in the loss landscape is presumed to
generalize better than a sharp minimum. Methods for determining flat minima
have been mostly researched for independent and identically distributed (i. i.
d.) data such as images. Graphs are inherently non-i. i. d. since the vertices
are edge-connected. We investigate flat minima methods and combinations of
those methods for training graph neural networks (GNNs). We use GCN and GAT as
well as extend Graph-MLP to work with more layers and larger graphs. We conduct
experiments on small and large citation, co-purchase, and protein datasets with
different train-test splits in both the transductive and inductive training
procedure. Results show that flat minima methods can improve the performance of
GNN models by over 2 points, if the train-test split is randomized. Following
Shchur et al., randomized splits are essential for a fair evaluation of GNNs,
as other (fixed) splits like 'Planetoid' are biased. Overall, we provide
important insights for improving and fairly evaluating flat minima methods on
GNNs. We recommend practitioners to always use weight averaging techniques, in
particular EWA when using early stopping. While weight averaging techniques are
only sometimes the best performing method, they are less sensitive to
hyperparameters, need no additional training, and keep the original model
unchanged. All source code is available in

metrics such as the type of the articles, funding availability, indexing type,
annual average number of citations and the number of access were analyzed to
quantitatively reveal the effects on the scientific audience. It's outlined
that deep learning-based studies gained momentum after year 2013, and the rate
of graph-based approaches in all deep learning studies increased linearly from
1% to 4% within the following 10 years. Conference publications scanned in the
Conference Proceeding Citation Index (CPCI) on the graph-based approaches
receive significantly more citations. The citation counts of the SCI-Expanded
and Emerging SCI indexed publications of the two streams are close to each
other. While the citation performances of the supported and unsupported
publications of the two sides were similar, pure deep learning studies received
more citations on the journal publication side and graph-based approaches
received more citations on the conference side. Despite their similar
performance in recent years, graph-based studies show twice more citation
performance as they get older, compared to traditional approaches. Annual
average citation performance per article for all deep learning studies is
11.051 in 2014, while it is 22.483 for graph-based studies. Also, despite
receiving 16% more access, graph-based papers get almost the same overall
citation over time with the pure counterpart. This is an indication that
graph-based approaches need a greater bunch of attention to follow, while pure

resulting in many studies and implementations. These systems help authors
automatically generate proper citations by suggesting relevant references based
on the text they have written. However, the methods used in citation
recommendation differ across various studies and implementations. Some
approaches focus on the overall content of papers, while others consider the
context of the citation text. Additionally, the datasets used in these studies
include different aspects of papers, such as metadata, citation context, or
even the full text of the paper in various formats and structures. The
diversity in models, datasets, and evaluation metrics makes it challenging to
assess and compare citation recommendation methods effectively. To address this
issue, a standardized dataset and evaluation metrics are needed to evaluate
these models consistently. Therefore, we propose developing a benchmark
specifically designed to analyze and compare citation recommendation models.
This benchmark will evaluate the performance of models on different features of
the citation context and provide a comprehensive evaluation of the models
across all these tasks, presenting the results in a standardized way. By
creating a benchmark with standardized evaluation metrics, researchers and
practitioners in the field of citation recommendation will have a common
platform to assess and compare different models. This will enable meaningful

artificially inflate citation-related performance indicators. Recently,
self-citations defined at the largest scale, i.e., country self-citations, have
started to attract the attention of researchers and policymakers. According to
a recent research, in fact, the anomalous trends in the country self-citation
rates of some countries, such as Italy, have been induced by the distorting
effect of citation metrics-centered science policies. In the present study, we
investigate the trends of country self-citations in 50 countries over the world
in the period 1996-2019 using Scopus data. Results show that for most countries
country self-citations have decreased over time. 12 countries (Colombia, Egypt,
Indonesia, Iran, Italy, Malaysia, Pakistan, Romania, Russian Federation, Saudi
Arabia, Thailand, and Ukraine), however, exhibit different behavior, with
anomalous trends of self-citations. We argue that these anomalies should be
attributed to the aggressive science policies adopted by these countries in
recent years, which are all characterized by direct or indirect incentives for
citations. Our analysis confirms that when bibliometric indicators are
integrated into systems of incentives, they are capable of affecting rapidly
and visibly the citation behavior of entire countries.

psychological testing, percentiles are already used widely as a standard to
evaluate an individual's test scores - intelligence tests for example - by
comparing them with the percentiles of a calibrated sample. Percentiles, or
percentile rank classes, are also a very suitable method for bibliometrics to
normalize citations of publications in terms of the subject category and the
publication year and, unlike the mean-based indicators (the relative citation
rates), percentiles are scarcely affected by skewed distributions of citations.
The percentile of a certain publication provides information about the citation
impact this publication has achieved in comparison to other similar
publications in the same subject category and publication year. Analyses of
percentiles, however, have not always been presented in the most effective and
meaningful way. New APA guidelines (American Psychological Association, 2010)
suggest a lesser emphasis on significance tests and a greater emphasis on the
substantive and practical significance of findings. Drawing on work by Cumming
(2012) we show how examinations of effect sizes (e.g. Cohen's d statistic) and

Numerical results demonstrate that existing algorithms converge on near-geodesic solutions. We also show that an approach based on longest paths produces similar results, is equally well motivated yet is much simpler to implement.
  However, the traditional single-path focus is unnecessarily restrictive, as many near-optimal paths highlight different key nodes. We introduce an approach using ``baskets'' of nodes where we select a fraction of nodes with the smallest values of a measure we call ``generalised criticality''. Analysis of large vaccine citation networks shows that these baskets achieve comprehensive algorithmic coverage, offering a robust, simple, and computationally efficient way to identify core knowledge structures. In practice, we find that those nodes with zero unit criticality capture the information in main paths in almost all cases and capture a wider range of key nodes without unnecessarily increasing the number of nodes considered. We find no advantage in using the traditional main path methods."

complex statistics model implemented on bibliometric individual data for over
15,000 Italian professors. Controlling for a number of covariates (number of
citable papers published by the author; presence of international authors;
number of co-authors; degree of the professor's specialization), the average
increase in self-citation rates following introduction of the ASN is of 9.5%.
The increase is common to all disciplines and academic ranks, albeit with
diverse magnitude. Moreover, the increase is sensitive to the relative

the availability of bibliographic data have made it easier for the researchers
to study the growth and dynamics of any discipline. We present a study on
""Econophysics"" metadata extracted from the Web of Science managed by the
Clarivate Analytics from 2000-2019. The study highlights the growth and
dynamics of the discipline by measures of a number of publications, citations
on publications, other disciplines contribution, institutions participation,
country-wise spread, etc. We investigate the impact of self-citations on
citations with every five-year interval. Also, we find the contribution of
other disciplines by analyzing the cited references. Results emerged from
micro, meso and macro-level analysis of collaborations show that the
distributions among authors collaboration and affiliations of authors follow a
power law. Thus, very few authors keep producing most of the papers and are
from a few institutions. We find that China is leading in the production of a
number of authors and a number of papers; however, shares more of national
collaboration rather than international, whereas the USA shares more
international collaboration. Finally, we demonstrate the evolution of the
author's collaborations and affiliations networks from 2000-2019. Overall the
analysis reveals the ""small-world"" property of the network with average path
length 5. As a consequence of our analysis, this study can serve as in-depth
knowledge to understand the growth and dynamics of the Econophysics network
both qualitatively and quantitatively.

A promising solution to mitigate this issue is to generate text with citations, providing a transparent chain for verification. However, existing work primarily focuses on generating citations for text-only content, leaving the challenges of multimodal scenarios largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce MCiteBench, the first benchmark designed to assess the ability of MLLMs to generate text with citations in multimodal contexts. Our benchmark comprises data derived from academic papers and review-rebuttal interactions, featuring diverse information sources and multimodal content. Experimental results reveal that MLLMs struggle to ground their outputs reliably when handling multimodal input. Further analysis uncovers a systematic modality bias and reveals how models internally rely on different sources when generating citations, offering insights into model behavior and guiding future directions for multimodal citation tasks."
gnn_citations,graph neural networks for citation analysis,287,1210.0732,0.6995287,Absolute and specific measures of research group excellence,stat.AP cs.DL physics.soc-ph,"  A desirable goal of scientific management is to introduce, if it exists, a
simple and reliable way to measure the scientific excellence of publicly-funded
research institutions and universities to serve as a basis for their ranking
and financing. While citation-based indicators and metrics are easily
accessible, they are far from being universally accepted as way to automate or
inform evaluation processes or to replace evaluations based on peer review.
Here we consider absolute measurements of research excellence at an
amalgamated, institutional level and specific measures of research excellence
as performance per head. Using biology research institutions in the UK as a
test case, we examine the correlations between peer-review-based and
citation-based measures of research excellence on these two scales. We find
that citation-based indicators are very highly correlated with peer-evaluated
measures of group strength but are poorly correlated with group quality. Thus,
and almost paradoxically, our analysis indicates that citation counts could
possibly form a basis for deciding on how to fund research institutions but
they should not be used as a basis for ranking them in terms of quality.

that alternates convolution-like operations on the graph and its dual. Our
approach allows to learn both vertex- and edge features and generalizes the
previous graph attention (GAT) model. We provide extensive experimental

requiring highly specialized models and extensive hyperparameter tuning. This
dataset-specific approach arises because each graph dataset often has unique
node features and diverse connectivity structures, making it difficult to build
a generalist model. To address these challenges, we introduce a scalable
multi-graph multi-task pretraining approach specifically tailored for node
classification tasks across diverse graph datasets from different domains. Our
method, Graph Foundation Model (GraphFM), leverages a Perceiver-based encoder
that employs learned latent tokens to compress domain-specific features into a
common latent space. This approach enhances the model's ability to generalize
across different graphs and allows for scaling across diverse data. We
demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by training a model on 152 different
graph datasets comprising over 7.4 million nodes and 189 million edges,
establishing the first set of scaling laws for multi-graph pretraining on
datasets spanning many domains (e.g., molecules, citation and product graphs).
Our results show that pretraining on a diverse array of real and synthetic
graphs improves the model's adaptability and stability, while performing
competitively with state-of-the-art specialist models. This work illustrates
that multi-graph pretraining can significantly reduce the burden imposed by the
current graph training paradigm, unlocking new capabilities for the field of
graph neural networks by creating a single generalist model that performs
competitively across a wide range of datasets and tasks.

authenticity of the presented information and verify it in the original
context. News articles, however, do not contain citations and only rarely refer
readers to further sources. Readers often cannot assess the authenticity of the
presented information as its origin is unclear. We present NewsDeps, the first
approach that analyzes and visualizes where information in news articles stems
from. NewsDeps employs methods from natural language processing and plagiarism
detection to measure article similarity. We devise a temporal-force-directed
graph that places articles as nodes chronologically. The graph connects
articles by edges varying in width depending on the articles' similarity. We
demonstrate our approach in a case study with two real-world scenarios. We find
that NewsDeps increases efficiency and transparency in news consumption by
revealing which previously published articles are the primary sources of each
given article.

applications dealing with graph data, such as citation networks or knowledge
graphs. While this task has been intensively approached from heuristics to
graph embeddings and graph neural networks (GNNs), providing explanations for
similarity has received less attention. In this work we are concerned with
explainable similarity search over graphs, by investigating how GNN-based
methods for computing node similarities can be augmented with explanations.
Specifically, we evaluate the performance of two prominent approaches towards
explanations in GNNs, based on the concepts of mutual information (MI), and
gradient-based explanations (GB). We discuss their suitability and empirically
validate the properties of their explanations over different popular graph
benchmarks. We find that unlike MI explanations, gradient-based explanations
have three desirable properties. First, they are actionable: selecting inputs
depending on them results in predictable changes in similarity scores. Second,
they are consistent: the effect of selecting certain inputs overlaps very
little with the effect of discarding them. Third, they can be pruned
significantly to obtain sparse explanations that retain the effect on
similarity scores.

  analyses: Three related explorative approaches",cs.DL,"  The article presents three advanced citation-based methods used to detect
potential breakthrough papers among very highly cited papers. We approach the
detection of such papers from three different perspectives in order to provide
different typologies of breakthrough papers. In all three cases we use the
classification of scientific publications developed at CWTS based on direct
citation relationships. This classification establishes clusters of papers at
three levels of aggregation. Papers are clustered based on their similar
citation orientations and it is assumed that they are focused on similar
research interests. We use the clustering as the context for detecting
potential breakthrough papers. We utilize the Characteristics Scores and Scales
(CSS) approach to partition citation distributions and implement a specific
filtering algorithm to sort out potential highly-cited followers, papers not
considered breakthroughs in themselves. After invoking thresholds and
filtering, three methods are explored: A very exclusive one where only the
highest cited paper in a micro-cluster is considered as a potential
breakthrough paper (M1); as well as two conceptually different methods, one
that detects potential breakthrough papers among the two percent highest cited
papers according to CSS (M2a), and finally a more restrictive version where, in
addition to the CSS two percent filter, knowledge diffusion is also taken in as
an extra parameter (M2b). The advance citation-based methods are explored and
evaluated using specifically validated publication sets linked to different
Danish funding instruments including centres of excellence.

focusing on publications by authors affiliated with Egyptian institutions.
Leveraging the Semantic Scholar platform and its API, a citation network and a

related to data quality, technical intricacies, and time constraints, resulting
in a reliable and robust dataset. The findings provide valuable information on
the impact of Egyptian publications, offering insights into the scholarly

evaluation of scientific impact. Many anecdotes advice authors to exploit this
fact and cite prospective reviewers to try obtaining a more positive evaluation
for their submission. In this work, we investigate if such a citation bias
actually exists: Does the citation of a reviewer's own work in a submission
cause them to be positively biased towards the submission? In conjunction with
the review process of two flagship conferences in machine learning and
algorithmic economics, we execute an observational study to test for citation
bias in peer review. In our analysis, we carefully account for various
confounding factors such as paper quality and reviewer expertise, and apply
different modeling techniques to alleviate concerns regarding the model
mismatch. Overall, our analysis involves 1,314 papers and 1,717 reviewers and
detects citation bias in both venues we consider. In terms of the effect size,
by citing a reviewer's work, a submission has a non-trivial chance of getting a
higher score from the reviewer: an expected increase in the score is
approximately 0.23 on a 5-point Likert item. For reference, a one-point
increase of a score by a single reviewer improves the position of a submission
by 11% on average.

provided by the Journal Citation Reports (JCR) 2012 of the Science and Social
Science Citation Indexes (SCI and SSCI) with similar data based on Scopus 2012.
First, global maps were developed for the two sets separately; sets of
documents can then be compared using overlays to both maps. Using fuzzy-string
matching and ISSN numbers, we were able to match 10,524 journal names between
the two sets; that is, 96.4% of the 10,936 journals contained in JCR or 51.2%
of the 20,554 journals covered by Scopus. Network analysis was then pursued on
the set of journals shared between the two databases and the two sets of unique
journals. Citations among the shared journals are more comprehensively covered
in JCR than Scopus, so the network in JCR is denser and more connected than in
Scopus. The ranking of shared journals in terms of indegree (that is, numbers
of citing journals) or total citations is similar in both databases overall
(Spearman's \r{ho} > 0.97), but some individual journals rank very differently.
Journals that are unique to Scopus seem to be less important--they are citing
shared journals rather than being cited by them--but the humanities are covered
better in Scopus than in JCR.

  Mathematical Content and Citations",cs.DL cs.IR,"  Identifying academic plagiarism is a pressing task for educational and
research institutions, publishers, and funding agencies. Current plagiarism
detection systems reliably find instances of copied and moderately reworded
text. However, reliably detecting concealed plagiarism, such as strong
paraphrases, translations, and the reuse of nontextual content and ideas is an
open research problem. In this paper, we extend our prior research on analyzing
mathematical content and academic citations. Both are promising approaches for
improving the detection of concealed academic plagiarism primarily in Science,
Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). We make the following
contributions: i) We present a two-stage detection process that combines
similarity assessments of mathematical content, academic citations, and text.
ii) We introduce new similarity measures that consider the order of
mathematical features and outperform the measures in our prior research. iii)
We compare the effectiveness of the math-based, citation-based, and text-based
detection approaches using confirmed cases of academic plagiarism. iv) We
demonstrate that the combined analysis of math-based and citation-based content
features allows identifying potentially suspicious cases in a collection of
102K STEM documents. Overall, we show that analyzing the similarity of
mathematical content and academic citations is a striking supplement for
conventional text-based detection approaches for academic literature in the
STEM disciplines.

of journal and article attributes, as well as online engagement metrics. It
employs a large-scale citation analysis of nearly 150,000 articles covering
diverse policy topics. The findings highlight that scholarly citations exert
the strongest positive influence on policy citations. Articles from journals
with a higher citation impact and larger Mendeley readership are cited more
frequently in policy documents. Other online engagements, such as news and blog
mentions, also boost policy citations, while mentions on social media X have a
negative effect. The finding that highly cited and widely read papers are also
frequently referenced in policy documents likely reflects the perception among
policymakers that such research is more trustworthy. In contrast, papers that
derive their influence primarily from social media tend to be cited less often
in policy contexts.

Personalization in this context meets individual researchers' needs by leveraging, through user profiles, the user related information (e.g. documents authored by a researcher), to improve search effectiveness and to reduce the information overload. While citation graphs are a valuable means to support the outcome of recommender systems, their use in personalized academic search (with, e.g. nodes as papers and edges as citations) is still under-explored.
  Existing personalized models for academic search often struggle to fully capture users' academic interests. To address this, we propose a two-step approach: first, training a neural language model for retrieval, then converting the academic graph into a knowledge graph and embedding it into a shared semantic space with the language model using translational embedding techniques. This allows user models to capture both explicit relationships and hidden structures in citation graphs and paper content. We evaluate our approach in four academic search domains, outperforming traditional graph-based and personalized models in three out of four, with up to a 10\% improvement in MAP@100 over the second-best model. This highlights the potential of knowledge graph-based user models to enhance retrieval effectiveness."

extracted citations from Microsoft Academic and Google Books in 17 fields.
About 60% of the BKCI books had records in Microsoft Academic, varying by year
and field. Citation counts from Microsoft Academic were 1.5 to 3.6 times higher
than from BKCI in nine subject areas across all years for books indexed by
both. Microsoft Academic found more citations than BKCI because it indexes more
scholarly publications and combines citations to different editions and
chapters. In contrast, BKCI only found more citations than Microsoft Academic
for books in three fields from 2013-2014. Microsoft Academic also found more
citations than Google Books in six fields for all years. Thus, Microsoft
Academic may be a useful source for the impact assessment of books when

  Citation Content Analysis",cs.DL cs.CL,"  Multidisciplinary cooperation is now common in research since social issues
inevitably involve multiple disciplines. In research articles, reference
information, especially citation content, is an important representation of
communication among different disciplines. Analyzing the distribution
characteristics of references from different disciplines in research articles
is basic to detecting the sources of referred information and identifying
contributions of different disciplines. This work takes articles in PLoS as the
data and characterizes the references from different disciplines based on
Citation Content Analysis (CCA). First, we download 210,334 full-text articles
from PLoS and collect the information of the in-text citations. Then, we
identify the discipline of each reference in these academic articles. To
characterize the distribution of these references, we analyze three
characteristics, namely, the number of citations, the average cited intensity
and the average citation length. Finally, we conclude that the distributions of
references from different disciplines are significantly different. Although
most references come from Natural Science, Humanities and Social Sciences play
important roles in the Introduction and Background sections of the articles.
Basic disciplines, such as Mathematics, mainly provide research methods in the
articles in PLoS. Citations mentioned in the Results and Discussion sections of
articles are mainly in-discipline citations, such as citations from Nursing and

Hypergraph neural networks have shown great promise at modeling higher-order relations, but their reliance on a fixed number of explicit message-passing layers limits long-range dependency capture and can destabilize training as depth grows. In this work, we introduce Implicit Hypergraph Neural Networks (IHGNN), which bring the implicit equilibrium formulation to hypergraphs: instead of stacking layers, IHGNN computes representations as the solution to a nonlinear fixed-point equation, enabling stable and efficient global propagation across hyperedges without deep architectures. We develop a well-posed training scheme with provable convergence, analyze the oversmoothing conditions and expressivity of the model, and derive a transductive generalization bound on hypergraphs. We further present an implicit-gradient training procedure coupled with a projection-based stabilization strategy. Extensive experiments on citation benchmarks show that IHGNN consistently outperforms strong traditional graph/hypergraph neural network baselines in both accuracy and robustness. Empirically, IHGNN is resilient to random initialization and hyperparameter variation, highlighting its strong generalization and practical value for higher-order relational learning."

sets and data studies with citations received from the other citation indexes.
The DCI harvests citations to research data from papers indexed in the Web of
Science. It relies on the information provided by the data repository as data
citation practices are inconsistent or inexistent in many cases. The findings
of this study show that data citation practices are far from common in most
research fields. Some differences have been reported on the way researchers
cite data: while in the areas of Science and Engineering and Technology data
sets were the most cited, in Social Sciences and Arts and Humanities data
studies play a greater role. A total of 88.1 percent of the records have
received no citation, but some repositories show very low uncitedness rates.
Although data citation practices are rare in most fields, they have expanded in
disciplines such as crystallography and genomics. We conclude by emphasizing
the role that the DCI could play in encouraging the consistent, standardized
citation of research data; a role that would enhance their value as a means of
following the research process from data collection to publication.

We examine citation distributions across top institutions within certain countries and find that the higher end of the distribution follows a Power Law or Pareto Law pattern; the scaling exponent of the Pareto Law varies depending on the number of top institutions included in the analysis. By adopting a novel entropy-based diversity measure, our findings reveal that countries with both small and large economies tend to cluster similarly in terms of citation diversity. The composition of countries within each group changes as the number of top institutions considered in the analysis varies. Moreover, we analyze citation diversity among award-winning scientists across six scientific disciplines, finding significant variations. We also explore the evolution of citation diversity over the past century across multiple fields. A gender-based study in several disciplines confirms varying citation diversities among male and female scientists. Our innovative citation diversity measure stands out as a valuable tool for assessing the unevenness of citation distributions, providing deeper insights that go beyond what traditional citation counts alone can reveal.

crucial roles in nearly every stage of scientific inquiry. Scholars are
advocating for the formal citation of software in academic publications,
treating it on par with traditional research outputs. However, software is
hardly consistently cited: one software entity can be cited as different
objects, and the citations can change over time. These issues, however, are
largely overlooked in existing empirical research on software citation. To fill
the above gaps, the present study compares and analyzes a longitudinal dataset
of citation formats of all R packages collected in 2021 and 2022, in order to
understand the citation formats of R-language packages, important members in
the open-source software family, and how the citations evolve over time. In
particular, we investigate the different document types underlying the
citations and what metadata elements in the citation formats changed over time.
Furthermore, we offer an in-depth analysis of the disciplinarity of journal
articles cited as software (software papers). By undertaking this research, we

broader set, dynamic citation networks represent a substantively important form
of acyclic digraphs. For example, the study of such networks includes the
spread of ideas through academic citations, the spread of innovation through
patent citations, and the development of precedent in common law systems. The
specific dynamics that produce such acyclic digraphs not only differentiate
them from other classes of graphs, but also provide guidance for the
development of meaningful distance measures. In this article, we develop and
apply our sink distance measure together with the single-linkage hierarchical
clustering algorithm to both a two-dimensional directed preferential attachment
model as well as empirical data drawn from the first quarter century of
decisions of the United States Supreme Court. Despite applying the simplest
combination of distance measures and clustering algorithms, analysis reveals
that more accurate and more interpretable clusterings are produced by this

publication similarity metric, which is based on common co-authors,
self-citations, shared references and citations, is established to perform a
two-step agglomerative clustering that first connects individual papers and
then merges similar clusters. This parameterized model is optimized using an
h-index based recall measure, favoring the correct assignment of well-cited
publications, and a name-initials-based precision using WoS metadata and
cross-referenced Google Scholar profiles. Despite the use of limited metadata,
we reach a recall of 87% and a precision of 88% with a preference for
researchers with high h-index values. 47 million articles of WoS can be

distribution model, confirming that the prediction is in excellent agreement
with the empirical data, and yielding insight into the utility of the h-index
in real academic ranking scenarios.

In addition, we also carry out an expert-based assessment of the results
produced by different methods. The expert-based assessment focuses on
publications in the field of scientometrics. Our findings seem to indicate that
there is a trade-off between different properties that may be considered
desirable for a good clustering of publications. Overall, map equation methods
appear to perform best in our analysis, suggesting that these methods deserve
more attention from the bibliometric community.

Network called GLDGCN based on the classic Graph Convolutional Neural
Network(GCN) by introducing dual convolutional layer and graph learning layer.
We apply GLDGCN to the semi-supervised node classification task. Compared with
the baseline methods, we achieve higher classification accuracy on three
citation networks Citeseer, Cora and Pubmed, and we also analyze and
discussabout selection of the hyperparameters and network depth. GLDGCN also
perform well on the classic social network KarateClub and the new Wiki-CS
dataset.
  For the insufficient ability of our algorithm to process large graphs during
the experiment, we also introduce subgraph clustering and stochastic gradient
descent methods into GCN and design a semi-supervised node classification
algorithm based on the CLustering Graph Convolutional neural Network, which
enables GCN to process large graph and improves its application value. We
complete semi-supervised node classification experiments on two classic large
graph which are PPI dataset (more than 50,000 nodes) and Reddit dataset (more
than 200,000 nodes), and also perform well.

  citation impacts: Web of Science, Scopus, and Dimensions as varying resonance
  chambers",cs.DL,"  Dimensions was introduced as an alternative bibliometric database to the
well-established Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus, however all three databases
have fundamental differences in coverage and content, resultant from their
owners' indexation philosophies. In light of these differences, we explore
here, using a citation network analysis and assessment of normalised citation
impact of ""duplicate"" publications, whether the three databases offer
structurally different perspectives of the bibliometric landscape or if they
are essentially homogenous substitutes. Our citation network analysis of core
and exclusive 2016-2018 publications revealed a large set of core publications
indexed in all three databases that are highly self-referential. In comparison,
each database selected a set of exclusive publications that appeared to hold
similarly low levels of relevance to the core set and to one another, with
slightly more internal communication between exclusive publications in Scopus
and Dimensions than WoS. Our comparison of normalised citations for 41,848
publications indexed in all three databases found that German sectors were
valuated as more impactful in Scopus and Dimensions compared to WoS,
particularly for sectors with an applied research focus. We conclude that the
databases do present structurally different perspectives, although Scopus and
Dimensions with their additional circle of applied research vary more from the
more base research-focused WoS than they do from one another.

  Window Length",cs.DL,"  The growing focus in research policy worldwide on top scientists makes it
increasingly important to define adequate supporting measures to help identify
excellent scientists. Highly cited publications have since long been associated
to research excellence. At the same time, the analysis of the high-end of
citation distributions still is a challenging topic in evaluative
bibliometrics. Evaluations typically require indicators that generate
sufficiently stable results when applied to recent publication records of
limited size. Highly cited publications have been identified using two
techniques in particular: pre-set percentiles, and the parameter free
Characteristic Scores and Scales (CSS) (Gl\""anzel & Schubert, 1988). The
stability required in assessments of relatively small publication records,
concerns size as well as content of groups of highly cited publications.
Influencing factors include domain delineation and citation window length.
Stability in size is evident for the pre-set percentiles, and has been
demonstrated for the CSS-methodology beyond an initial citation period of about
three years (Gl\""anzel, 2007). Stability in content is less straightforward,
considering for instance that more highly cited publications can have a later
citation peak, as observed by Abt (1981) for astronomical papers. This paper
investigates the stability in content of groups of highly cited publications,
i.e. the extent to which individual publications enter and leave the group as
the citation window is enlarged.

  Extraction",cs.DL cs.CL,"  Automatically extracting key information from scientific documents has the
potential to help scientists work more efficiently and accelerate the pace of
scientific progress. Prior work has considered extracting document-level entity
clusters and relations end-to-end from raw scientific text, which can improve
literature search and help identify methods and materials for a given problem.
Despite the importance of this task, most existing works on scientific
information extraction (SciIE) consider extraction solely based on the content
of an individual paper, without considering the paper's place in the broader
literature. In contrast to prior work, we augment our text representations by
leveraging a complementary source of document context: the citation graph of
referential links between citing and cited papers. On a test set of
English-language scientific documents, we show that simple ways of utilizing
the structure and content of the citation graph can each lead to significant
gains in different scientific information extraction tasks. When these tasks
are combined, we observe a sizable improvement in end-to-end information
extraction over the state-of-the-art, suggesting the potential for future work
along this direction. We release software tools to facilitate citation-aware
SciIE development.

promise to complement traditional citation-based indicators. However, no study
has focused on their potential usefulness to capture the impact of scholarly
books. While recent literature shows that citation indicators cannot fully
capture the impact of books, other studies have suggested alternative
indicators such as usage, publishers' prestige or library holdings. In this
paper, we calculate 18 indicators which range from altmetrics to library
holdings, views, downloads or citations to the production of monographs of a
Spanish university using the bibliometric suite PlumX from EBSCO. The objective
of the study is to adopt a multidimensional perspective on the analysis of
books and understand the level of complementarity between these different
indicators. Also, we compare the overview offered by this range of indicators
when applied to monographs with the traditional bibliometric perspective
focused on journal articles and citation impact. We observe a low presence of
altmetric indicators for monographs, even lower than for journal articles and a
predominance of library holdings, confirming this indicator as the most
promising one towards the analysis of the impact of books.

computer science citation databases DBLP and CiteSeer. The database entries in
DBLP are inserted manually while the CiteSeer entries are obtained autonomously
via a crawl of the Web and automatic processing of user submissions. CiteSeer's
autonomous citation database can be considered a form of self-selected on-line
survey. It is important to understand the limitations of such databases,
particularly when citation information is used to assess the performance of
authors, institutions and funding bodies.
  We show that the CiteSeer database contains considerably fewer single author
papers. This bias can be modeled by an exponential process with intuitive
explanation. The model permits us to predict that the DBLP database covers
approximately 24% of the entire literature of Computer Science. CiteSeer is
also biased against low-cited papers.
  Despite their difference, both databases exhibit similar and significantly
different citation distributions compared with previous analysis of the Physics
community. In both databases, we also observe that the number of authors per
paper has been increasing over time.

However, as preprints increasingly serve as an independent medium for scholarly communication rather than precursors to the version of record, it remains uncertain how preprint usage is shaping scientific discourse. Our research revealed that the preprint citations exhibit significantly higher inequality than journal citations, consistently among categories. This trend persisted even when controlling for age and the mean citation count of the journal matched to each of the preprint categories. We also found that the citation inequality in preprints is not solely driven by a few highly cited papers or those with no impact, but rather reflects a broader systemic effect. Whether the preprint is subsequently published in a journal or not does not significantly affect the citation inequality. Further analyses of the structural factors show that preferential attachment does not significantly contribute to citation inequality in preprints, whereas author prestige plays a substantial role. Notably, the gap in citation inequality between the preprint category and the journal is more pronounced in fields where preprints are more established, such as mathematics, physics, and high-energy physics. This highlights a potential vulnerability in preprint ecosystems where reputation-driven citation may hinder scientific diversity."

clinical trials has been considered as one of the most appropriate indicators
for quantifying the clinical impact of biomedical papers. Therefore, the early
prediction of the clinical citation count of biomedical papers is critical to
scientific activities in biomedicine, such as research evaluation, resource
allocation, and clinical translation. In this study, we designed a four-layer
multilayer perceptron neural network (MPNN) model to predict the clinical
citation count of biomedical papers in the future by using 9,822,620 biomedical
papers published from 1985 to 2005. We extracted ninety-one paper features from
three dimensions as the input of the model, including twenty-one features in
the paper dimension, thirty-five in the reference dimension, and thirty-five in
the citing paper dimension. In each dimension, the features can be classified
into three categories, i.e., the citation-related features, the clinical
translation-related features, and the topic-related features. Besides, in the
paper dimension, we also considered the features that have previously been
demonstrated to be related to the citation counts of research papers. The
results showed that the proposed MPNN model outperformed the other five
baseline models, and the features in the reference dimension were the most
important.

literature. Generally, citations are analyzed quantitatively whereas
qualitative analysis of citations can reveal deeper insights into the impact of
a scientific artifact in the community. Therefore, citation impact analysis
(which includes sentiment and intent classification) enables us to quantify the
quality of the citations which can eventually assist us in the estimation of
ranking and impact. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, we
benchmark the well-known language models like BERT and ALBERT along with
several popular networks for both tasks of sentiment and intent classification.
Second, we provide ImpactCite, which is XLNet-based method for citation impact
analysis. All evaluations are performed on a set of publicly available citation
analysis datasets. Evaluation results reveal that ImpactCite achieves a new
state-of-the-art performance for both citation intent and sentiment
classification by outperforming the existing approaches by 3.44% and 1.33% in
F1-score. Therefore, we emphasize ImpactCite (XLNet-based solution) for both
tasks to better understand the impact of a citation. Additional efforts have
been performed to come up with CSC-Clean corpus, which is a clean and reliable

  Citation Networks",cs.IR cs.LG,"  Due to the rapid growth of scientific publications, identifying all related
reference articles in the literature has become increasingly challenging yet
highly demanding. Existing methods primarily assess candidate publications from
a static perspective, focusing on the content of articles and their structural
information, such as citation relationships. There is a lack of research
regarding how to account for the evolving impact among papers on their
embeddings. Toward this goal, this paper introduces a temporal dimension to
paper recommendation strategies. The core idea is to continuously update a
paper's embedding when new citation relationships appear, enhancing its
relevance for future recommendations. Whenever a citation relationship is added
to the literature upon the publication of a paper, the embeddings of the two
related papers are updated through a Temporal Graph Neural Network (TGN). A
learnable memory update module based on a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is
utilized to study the evolution of the embedding of a paper in order to predict
its reference impact in a future timestamp. Such a TGN-based model learns a
pattern of how people's views of the paper may evolve, aiming to guide paper
recommendations more precisely. Extensive experiments on an open citation
network dataset, including 313,278 articles from
https://paperswithcode.com/about PaperWithCode, have demonstrated the
effectiveness of the proposed approach.

para-scientific areas, focusing on the case of Analytic Philosophy. The
theoretical framework chosen for the analysis is Kuhn's theory of normal
science. The methodology employed is qualitative citation context analysis. A
sample of 60 papers published in leading Analytic Philosophy journals between
1950 and 2009 is analyzed, and a specific classsificatory scheme is developed
to classify citations according to their epistemological function. Compared to
previous studies of citation context, this is the first paper that includes the
temporal dimension into the analysis of citation context, in order to gain
insights into the process of knowledge accumulation. Interestingly, the results
show that Analytic Philosophy started accumulating after Second World War, but
in a peculiar way. The accumulation was not matched by a corresponding rising
consensus. This can be explained by the hypothesis that AP underwent a process
of fragmentation in sub-fields during the second half of the century.

learning interpretable latent representations for undirected graphs. We
demonstrate this model using a graph convolutional network (GCN) encoder and a
simple inner product decoder. Our model achieves competitive results on a link

unsupervised learning on graph-structured data and link prediction, our model
can naturally incorporate node features, which significantly improves
predictive performance on a number of benchmark datasets.

gnn_citations,graph neural networks for citation analysis,326,2007.09296,0.6961747,Towards Deeper Graph Neural Networks,cs.LG stat.ML,"  Graph neural networks have shown significant success in the field of graph
representation learning. Graph convolutions perform neighborhood aggregation
and represent one of the most important graph operations. Nevertheless, one
layer of these neighborhood aggregation methods only consider immediate
neighbors, and the performance decreases when going deeper to enable larger
receptive fields. Several recent studies attribute this performance
deterioration to the over-smoothing issue, which states that repeated
propagation makes node representations of different classes indistinguishable.
In this work, we study this observation systematically and develop new insights
towards deeper graph neural networks. First, we provide a systematical analysis
on this issue and argue that the key factor compromising the performance
significantly is the entanglement of representation transformation and
propagation in current graph convolution operations. After decoupling these two
operations, deeper graph neural networks can be used to learn graph node
representations from larger receptive fields. We further provide a theoretical
analysis of the above observation when building very deep models, which can
serve as a rigorous and gentle description of the over-smoothing issue. Based
on our theoretical and empirical analysis, we propose Deep Adaptive Graph
Neural Network (DAGNN) to adaptively incorporate information from large
receptive fields. A set of experiments on citation, co-authorship, and
co-purchase datasets have confirmed our analysis and insights and demonstrated
the superiority of our proposed methods.

Our approach combines multiple retrieval methods with a four-class classification system (Supported, Partially Supported, Unsupported, Uncertain) that captures nuanced claim-source relationships and enables appropriate remedial actions for different error types. Our experiments show that fine-tuned lightweight language models achieve performance comparable to large commercial systems with significantly lower computational requirements, making large-scale citation verification practically feasible. The system provides transparent, evidence-based explanations that support user understanding and trust. We contribute a comprehensive dataset of over 1,000 citations with detailed alignments, functional classifications, semantic annotations, and bibliometric metadata across eight disciplines, alongside fine-tuned models and the complete verification framework as open-source software.

dynamics calibrated on empirical data, we compare several indicators for the
scientific impact of individual researchers. The use of such a controlled setup
has the advantage of avoiding the biases present in real databases, and allows
us to assess which aspects of the model dynamics and which traits of individual
researchers a particular indicator actually reflects. We find that the simple
citation average performs well in capturing the intrinsic scientific ability of
researchers, whatever the length of their career. On the other hand, when
productivity complements ability in the evaluation process, the notorious $h$
and $g$ indices reveal their potential, yet their normalized variants do not
always yield a fair comparison between researchers at different career stages.
Notably, the use of logarithmic units for citation counts allows us to build
simple indicators with performance equal to that of $h$ and $g$. Our analysis
may provide useful hints for a proper use of bibliometric indicators.
Additionally, our framework can be extended by including other aspects of the
scientific production process and citation dynamics, with the potential to
become a standard tool for the assessment of impact metrics.

However, their interpretability is far from ideal. One such shortcoming is the
difficulty of deducing a network's ability to generalize to unseen data. We use
topological data analysis to show that the information encoded in the weights
of a CNN can be organized in terms of a topological data model and demonstrate
how such information can be interpreted and utilized. We show that the weights
of convolutional layers at depths from 1 through 13 learn simple global
structures. We also demonstrate the change of the simple structures over the
course of training. In particular, we define and analyze the spaces of spatial
filters of convolutional layers and show the recurrence, among all networks,
depths, and during training, of a simple circle consisting of rotating edges,
as well as a less recurring unanticipated complex circle that combines lines,
edges, and non-linear patterns. We also demonstrate that topological structure
correlates with a network's ability to generalize to unseen data and that
topological information can be used to improve a network's performance. We
train over a thousand CNN's on MNIST, CIFAR-10, SVHN, and ImageNet.

hypotheses. Method: We use multiple regression analyses to examine a data set
comprising the titles, abstracts, keywords, and authors of 16,131 software

partially confirm and partially go counter to prior findings in software

new source for indicators to help measure the impact of scholarly research in
ways that are complementary to traditional citation-based indicators. Data
generated from social media activities related to scholarly content can be used
to reflect broad types of impact. This paper aims to provide systematic
evidence regarding how often Twitter is used to diffuse journal articles in the
biomedical and life sciences. The analysis is based on a set of 1.4 million
documents covered by both PubMed and Web of Science (WoS) and published between
2010 and 2012. The number of tweets containing links to these documents was
analyzed to evaluate the degree to which certain journals, disciplines, and
specialties were represented on Twitter. It is shown that, with less than 10%
of PubMed articles mentioned on Twitter, its uptake is low in general. The
relationship between tweets and WoS citations was examined for each document at
the level of journals and specialties. The results show that tweeting behavior
varies between journals and specialties and correlations between tweets and
citations are low, implying that impact metrics based on tweets are different
from those based on citations. A framework utilizing the coverage of articles
and the correlation between Twitter mentions and citations is proposed to
facilitate the evaluation of novel social-media based metrics and to shed light
on the question in how far the number of tweets is a valid metric to measure
research impact.

gnn_citations,graph neural networks for citation analysis,335,2301.12663,0.6947974,Citation Analysis of Computer Systems Papers,cs.DL,"  Citation analysis is used extensively in the bibliometrics literature to
assess the impact of individual works, researchers, institutions, and even
entire fields of study. In this paper, we analyze citations in one large and
influential field within computer science, namely computer systems. Using
citation data from a cross-sectional sample of 2,088 papers in 50 systems
conferences from 2017, we examine four research questions: overall distribution
of systems citations; their evolution over time; the differences between
databases (Google Scholar and Scopus) for systems papers, and; the
characteristics of self-citations in the field.
  We find that only 1.5% of papers remain uncited after five years, while 12.8%
accrued at least 100 citations, both statistics comparing favorably to many
other scientific fields. The most cited subfields and conference areas within
systems were security, databases, and computer architecture. Most papers
achieved their first citation within a year from publication, and the median
citation count continued to grow at an almost linear rate over five years, with
only a few papers peaking before that. We also find that early citations could
be linked to papers with a freely available preprint, or may be primarily
composed of self-citations. The ratio of self-citations to total citations
starts relatively high for most papers but appears to stabilize by 12--18
months, at which point highly cited papers revert to predominately external
citations. Past self-citation count (taken from each paper's reference list)
appears to bear little if any relationship with the future self-citation count
of each paper. The choice of citation database also makes little difference in
relative citation comparisons, despite marked differences in absolute counts.

  empirical study based on F1000Prime data",cs.DL,"  In this study, we address the question whether (and to what extent,
respectively) altmetrics are related to the scientific quality of papers (as
measured by peer assessments). Only a few studies have previously investigated
the relationship between altmetrics and assessments by peers. In the first
step, we analyse the underlying dimensions of measurement for traditional
metrics (citation counts) and altmetrics - by using principal component
analysis (PCA) and factor analysis (FA). In the second step, we test the
relationship between the dimensions and quality of papers (as measured by the
post-publication peer-review system of F1000Prime assessments) - using
regression analysis. The results of the PCA and FA show that altmetrics operate
along different dimensions, whereas Mendeley counts are related to citation
counts, and tweets form a separate dimension. The results of the regression
analysis indicate that citation-based metrics and readership counts are
significantly more related to quality, than tweets. This result on the one hand
questions the use of Twitter counts for research evaluation purposes and on the
other hand indicates potential use of Mendeley reader counts.

as an important research topic. In recent years, several approaches and

  trajectories",cs.SI cs.DB cs.DL cs.IR cs.LG,"  Citation maturity time varies for different articles. However, the impact of
all articles is measured in a fixed window. Clustering their citation
trajectories helps understand the knowledge diffusion process and reveals that
not all articles gain immediate success after publication. Moreover, clustering
trajectories is necessary for paper impact recommendation algorithms. It is a
challenging problem because citation time series exhibit significant
variability due to non linear and non stationary characteristics. Prior works
propose a set of arbitrary thresholds and a fixed rule based approach. All
methods are primarily parameter dependent. Consequently, it leads to
inconsistencies while defining similar trajectories and ambiguities regarding
their specific number. Most studies only capture extreme trajectories. Thus, a
generalised clustering framework is required. This paper proposes a feature
based multiple k means cluster ensemble framework. 1,95,783 and 41,732 well
cited articles from the Microsoft Academic Graph data are considered for
clustering short term (10 year) and long term (30 year) trajectories,
respectively. It has linear run time. Four distinct trajectories are obtained
Early Rise Rapid Decline (2.2%), Early Rise Slow Decline (45%), Delayed Rise No
Decline (53%), and Delayed Rise Slow Decline (0.8%). Individual trajectory
differences for two different spans are studied. Most papers exhibit Early Rise
Slow Decline and Delayed Rise No Decline patterns. The growth and decay times,
cumulative citation distribution, and peak characteristics of individual
trajectories are redefined empirically. A detailed comparative study reveals
our proposed methodology can detect all distinct trajectory classes.

gnn_citations,graph neural networks for citation analysis,339,1510.08881,0.6944387,Distributions for cited articles from individual subjects and years,cs.DL,"  The citations to a set of academic articles are typically unevenly shared,
with many articles attracting few citations and few attracting many. It is
important to know more precisely how citations are distributed in order to help
statistical analyses of citations, especially for sets of articles from a
single discipline and a small range of years, as normally used for research
evaluation. This article fits discrete versions of the power law, the lognormal
distribution and the hooked power law to 20 different Scopus categories, using
citations to articles published in 2004 and ignoring uncited articles. The
results show that, despite its popularity, the power law is not a suitable
model for collections of articles from a single subject and year, even for the
purpose of estimating the slope of the tail of the citation data. Both the
hooked power law and the lognormal distributions fit best for some subjects but
neither is a universal optimal choice and parameter estimates for both seem to
be unreliable. Hence only the hooked power law and discrete lognormal
distributions should be considered for subject-and-year-based citation analysis
in future and parameter estimates should always be interpreted cautiously.

gnn_citations,graph neural networks for citation analysis,340,2007.04070,0.69436777,Learning Neural Textual Representations for Citation Recommendation,cs.CL,"  With the rapid growth of the scientific literature, manually selecting
appropriate citations for a paper is becoming increasingly challenging and
time-consuming. While several approaches for automated citation recommendation
have been proposed in the recent years, effective document representations for
citation recommendation are still elusive to a large extent. For this reason,
in this paper we propose a novel approach to citation recommendation which
leverages a deep sequential representation of the documents (Sentence-BERT)
cascaded with Siamese and triplet networks in a submodular scoring function. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to combine deep
representations and submodular selection for a task of citation recommendation.
Experiments have been carried out using a popular benchmark dataset - the ACL
Anthology Network corpus - and evaluated against baselines and a
state-of-the-art approach using metrics such as the MRR and F1-at-k score. The
results show that the proposed approach has been able to outperform all the
compared approaches in every measured metric.

  publications",cs.DL physics.soc-ph,"  We analyze the citation time-series of manuscripts in three different fields
of science; physics, social science and technology. The evolution of the
time-series of the yearly number of citations, namely the citation
trajectories, diffuse anomalously, their variance scales with time $\propto
t^{2H}$, where $H\neq 1/2$. We provide detailed analysis of the various factors
that lead to the anomalous behavior: non-stationarity, long-ranged correlations
and a fat-tailed increment distribution. The papers exhibit high degree of
heterogeneity, across the various fields, as the statistics of the highest
cited papers is fundamentally different from that of the lower ones. The
citation data is shown to be highly correlated and non-stationary; as all the
papers except the small percentage of them with high number of citations, die
out in time.

  Citation Prediction",cs.DL cs.LG physics.soc-ph,"  Accurate citation count prediction of newly published papers could help
editors and readers rapidly figure out the influential papers in the future.
Though many approaches are proposed to predict a paper's future citation, most
ignore the dynamic heterogeneous graph structure or node importance in academic
networks. To cope with this problem, we propose a Dynamic heterogeneous Graph
and Node Importance network (DGNI) learning framework, which fully leverages
the dynamic heterogeneous graph and node importance information to predict
future citation trends of newly published papers. First, a dynamic
heterogeneous network embedding module is provided to capture the dynamic
evolutionary trends of the whole academic network. Then, a node importance
embedding module is proposed to capture the global consistency relationship to
figure out each paper's node importance. Finally, the dynamic evolutionary
trend embeddings and node importance embeddings calculated above are combined
to jointly predict the future citation counts of each paper, by a log-normal
distribution model according to multi-faced paper node representations.
Extensive experiments on two large-scale datasets demonstrate that our model
significantly improves all indicators compared to the SOTA models.

gnn_citations,graph neural networks for citation analysis,343,1511.05078,0.6942566,"Which type of citation analysis generates the most accurate taxonomy of
  scientific and technical knowledge?",cs.DL,"  In 1965, Derek de Solla Price foresaw the day when a citation-based taxonomy
of science and technology would be delineated and correspondingly used for
science policy. A taxonomy needs to be comprehensive and accurate if it is to
be useful for policy making, especially now that policy makers are utilizing
citation-based indicators to evaluate people, institutions and laboratories.
Determining the accuracy of a taxonomy, however, remains a challenge. Previous
work on the accuracy of partition solutions is sparse, and the results of those
studies, while useful, have not been definitive. In this study we compare the
accuracies of topic-level taxonomies based on the clustering of documents using
direct citation, bibliographic coupling, and co-citation. Using a set of new
gold standards - articles with at least 100 references - we find that direct
citation is better at concentrating references than either bibliographic
coupling or co-citation. Using the assumption that higher concentrations of
references denote more accurate clusters, direct citation thus provides a more
accurate representation of the taxonomy of scientific and technical knowledge
than either bibliographic coupling or co-citation. We also find that
discipline-level taxonomies based on journal schema are highly inaccurate
compared to topic-level taxonomies, and recommend against their use.

gnn_citations,graph neural networks for citation analysis,344,2408.04662,0.69413733,Citekit: A Modular Toolkit for Large Language Model Citation Generation,cs.CL cs.AI,"  Enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate citations in
Question-Answering (QA) tasks is an emerging paradigm aimed at enhancing the
verifiability of their responses when LLMs are utilizing external references to
generate an answer. However, there is currently no unified framework to
standardize and fairly compare different citation generation methods, leading
to difficulties in reproducing different methods and a comprehensive
assessment. To cope with the problems above, we introduce \name, an open-source
and modular toolkit designed to facilitate the implementation and evaluation of
existing citation generation methods, while also fostering the development of
new approaches to improve citation quality in LLM outputs. This tool is highly
extensible, allowing users to utilize 4 main modules and 14 components to
construct a pipeline, evaluating an existing method or innovative designs. Our
experiments with two state-of-the-art LLMs and 11 citation generation baselines
demonstrate varying strengths of different modules in answer accuracy and
citation quality improvement, as well as the challenge of enhancing
granularity. Based on our analysis of the effectiveness of components, we
propose a new method, self-RAG \snippet, obtaining a balanced answer accuracy
and citation quality. Citekit is released at

represent causal connections. We propose methods of analysing such directed
acyclic graphs taking into account the constraints of causality and
highlighting the causal structure. We illustrate our approach using citation
networks formed from academic papers, patents, and US Supreme Court verdicts.
We show how transitive reduction reveals fundamental differences in the
citation practices of different areas, how it highlights particularly
interesting work, and how it can correct for the effect that the age of a
document has on its citation count. Finally, we transitively reduce null models
of citation networks with similar degree distributions and show the difference
in degree distributions after transitive reduction to illustrate the lack of
causal structure in such models.

  data set",physics.soc-ph cs.DL,"  Citation numbers and other quantities derived from bibliographic databases
are becoming standard tools for the assessment of productivity and impact of
research activities. Though widely used, still their statistical properties
have not been well established so far. This is especially true in the case of
bibliometric indicators aimed at the evaluation of individual scholars, because
large-scale data sets are typically difficult to be retrieved. Here, we take
advantage of a recently introduced large bibliographic data set, Google Scholar
Citations, which collects the entire publication record of individual scholars.
We analyze the scientific profile of more than 30,000 researchers, and study
the relation between the h-index, the number of publications and the number of
citations of individual scientists. While the number of publications of a
scientist has a rather weak relation with his/her h-index, we find that the
h-index of a scientist is strongly correlated with the number of citations that
she/he has received so that the number of citations can be effectively be used
as a proxy of the h-index. Allowing for the h-index to depend on both the
number of citations and the number of publications, we find only a minor
improvement.

gnn_citations,graph neural networks for citation analysis,347,2210.13148,0.6939892,Transformers over Directed Acyclic Graphs,cs.LG cs.AI,"  Transformer models have recently gained popularity in graph representation
learning as they have the potential to learn complex relationships beyond the
ones captured by regular graph neural networks. The main research question is
how to inject the structural bias of graphs into the transformer architecture,
and several proposals have been made for undirected molecular graphs and,
recently, also for larger network graphs. In this paper, we study transformers
over directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and propose architecture adaptations
tailored to DAGs: (1) An attention mechanism that is considerably more
efficient than the regular quadratic complexity of transformers and at the same
time faithfully captures the DAG structure, and (2) a positional encoding of
the DAG's partial order, complementing the former. We rigorously evaluate our
approach over various types of tasks, ranging from classifying source code
graphs to nodes in citation networks, and show that it is effective in two
important aspects: in making graph transformers generally outperform graph
neural networks tailored to DAGs and in improving SOTA graph transformer
performance in terms of both quality and efficiency.

January 2018. Dimensions includes journal articles and citation counts, making
it a potential new source of impact data. This article explores the value of
Dimensions from an impact assessment perspective with an examination of Food
Science research 2008-2018 and a random sample of 10,000 Scopus articles from
2012. The results include high correlations between citation counts from Scopus
and Dimensions (0.96 by narrow field in 2012) as well as similar average
counts. Almost all Scopus articles with DOIs were found in Dimensions (97% in
2012). Thus, the scholarly database component of Dimensions seems to be a
plausible alternative to Scopus and the Web of Science for general citation
analyses and for citation data in support of some types of research
evaluations.

  citation characteristics on the impact of individual researchers",physics.soc-ph physics.data-an,"  The representation of science as a citation-density landscape and the study
of scaling rules with the field-specific citation-density as a main topological

focus is on the individual researcher. In this new analysis, the
size-dependence of several main bibliometric indicators for a large set of

observed for research groups are here described for individual researchers,
reinforcing the idea of prevalent scaling rules in the representation of
science as a citation-density landscape. Differences among thematic areas with
different citation densities are discussed.

gnn_citations,graph neural networks for citation analysis,350,2405.04098,0.693828,Binarized Simplicial Convolutional Neural Networks,cs.LG eess.SP,"  Graph Neural Networks have a limitation of solely processing features on
graph nodes, neglecting data on high-dimensional structures such as edges and
triangles. Simplicial Convolutional Neural Networks (SCNN) represent
higher-order structures using simplicial complexes to break this limitation
albeit still lacking time efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel neural
network architecture on simplicial complexes named Binarized Simplicial
Convolutional Neural Networks (Bi-SCNN) based on the combination of simplicial
convolution with a binary-sign forward propagation strategy. The usage of the
Hodge Laplacian on a binary-sign forward propagation enables Bi-SCNN to
efficiently and effectively represent simplicial features that have
higher-order structures than traditional graph node representations. Compared
to the previous Simplicial Convolutional Neural Networks, the reduced model
complexity of Bi-SCNN shortens the execution time without sacrificing the
prediction performance and is less prone to the over-smoothing effect.
Experimenting with real-world citation and ocean-drifter data confirmed that
our proposed Bi-SCNN is efficient and accurate.

gnn_citations,graph neural networks for citation analysis,351,2301.10536,0.69353884,"Understanding and Improving Deep Graph Neural Networks: A Probabilistic
  Graphical Model Perspective",cs.LG,"  Recently, graph-based models designed for downstream tasks have significantly
advanced research on graph neural networks (GNNs). GNN baselines based on
neural message-passing mechanisms such as GCN and GAT perform worse as the
network deepens. Therefore, numerous GNN variants have been proposed to tackle
this performance degradation problem, including many deep GNNs. However, a
unified framework is still lacking to connect these existing models and
interpret their effectiveness at a high level. In this work, we focus on deep
GNNs and propose a novel view for understanding them. We establish a
theoretical framework via inference on a probabilistic graphical model. Given
the fixed point equation (FPE) derived from the variational inference on the
Markov random fields, the deep GNNs, including JKNet, GCNII, DGCN, and the
classical GNNs, such as GCN, GAT, and APPNP, can be regarded as different
approximations of the FPE. Moreover, given this framework, more accurate
approximations of FPE are brought, guiding us to design a more powerful GNN:
coupling graph neural network (CoGNet). Extensive experiments are carried out
on citation networks and natural language processing downstream tasks. The
results demonstrate that the CoGNet outperforms the SOTA models.

in the framework of network theory. In particular we analyse the network
extracted by Principia Mathematica of B. Russell and A.N. Whitehead, where the
vertices are the statements and two statements are connected with a directed
link if one statement is used to demonstrate the other one. We compare the
obtained network with other directed acyclic graphs, such as a scientific
citation network and a stochastic model. We also introduce a novel topological
ordering for directed acyclic graphs and we discuss its properties in respect
to the classical one. The main result is the observation that formal systems of
knowledge topologically behave similarly to self-organised systems.

scientific papers published in one year. While these distributions can be
fitted by a power-law dependence we find that they are nonstationary and the
exponent of the power law fit decreases with time and does not come to
saturation. We attribute the nonstationarity of citation distributions to
different longevity of the low-cited and highly-cited papers. By measuring
citation trajectories of papers we found that citation careers of the low-cited
papers come to saturation after 10-15 years while those of the highly-cited
papers continue to increase indefinitely: the papers that exceed some citation
threshold become runaways. Thus, we show that although citation distribution
can look as a power-law, it is not scale-free and there is a hidden dynamic
scale associated with the onset of runaways. We compare our measurements to our
recently developed model of citation dynamics based on
copying/redirection/triadic closure and find explanations to our empirical
observations.

gnn_citations,graph neural networks for citation analysis,354,1810.08809,0.6932386,On the Heterogeneous Distributions in Paper Citations,cs.DL physics.soc-ph,"  Academic papers have been the protagonists in disseminating expertise.
Naturally, paper citation pattern analysis is an efficient and essential way of
investigating the knowledge structure of science and technology. For decades,
it has been observed that citation of scientific literature follows a
heterogeneous and heavy-tailed distribution, and many of them suggest a
power-law distribution, log-normal distribution, and related distributions.
However, many studies are limited to small-scale approaches; therefore, it is
hard to generalize. To overcome this problem, we investigate 21 years of
citation evolution through a systematic analysis of the entire citation history
of 42,423,644 scientific literatures published from 1996 to 2016 and contained
in SCOPUS. We tested six candidate distributions for the scientific literature
in three distinct levels of Scimago Journal & Country Rank (SJR) classification
scheme. First, we observe that the raw number of annual citation acquisitions
tends to follow the log-normal distribution for all disciplines, except for the
first year of the publication. We also find significant disparity between the
yearly acquired citation number among the journals, which suggests that it is
essential to remove the citation surplus inherited from the prestige of the
journals. Our simple method for separating the citation preference of an
individual article from the inherited citation of the journals reveals an
unexpected regularity in the normalized annual acquisitions of citations across
the entire field of science. Specifically, the normalized annual citation
acquisitions have power-law probability distributions with an exponential
cut-off of the exponents around 2.3, regardless of its publication and citation
year. Our results imply that journal reputation has a substantial long-term
impact on the citation.

results and for the transmission of credit. But they are hard to track, because
of the absence of a common citation standard. As a consequence, the FORCE11
recently proposed data and software citation principles as guidance for
authors. Zenodo is recognized for the implementation of DOIs for software on a
large scale. The minting of complementary DOIs for the version and concept
allows measuring the impact of dynamic software. This article investigates
characteristics of 5,456 citations to Zenodo data and software that were
captured by the Asclepias Broker in January 2019. We analyzed the current state
of data and software citation practices and the quality of software citation
recommendations with regard to the impact of recent standardization efforts.
Our findings prove that current citation practices and recommendations do not
match proposed citation standards. We consequently suggest practical first
steps towards the implementation of the software citation principles.

  Citations to HCI Research",cs.HC cs.CY cs.DL,"  What is the impact of human-computer interaction research on industry? While
it is impossible to track all research impact pathways, the growing literature
on translational research impact measurement offers patent citations as one
measure of how industry recognizes and draws on research in its inventions. In
this paper, we perform a large-scale measurement study primarily of 70,000
patent citations to premier HCI research venues, tracing how HCI research are
cited in United States patents over the last 30 years. We observe that 20.1% of
papers from these venues, including 60--80% of papers at UIST and 13% of papers
in a broader dataset of SIGCHI-sponsored venues overall, are cited by patents
-- far greater than premier venues in science overall (9.7%) and NLP (11%).
However, the time lag between a patent and its paper citations is long (10.5
years) and getting longer, suggesting that HCI research and practice may not be
efficiently connected.

from the point of view of graph theory analysis, specifically graph curvature.
Graph curvature (e.g., Ricci curvature) has been used to analyze system
dynamics and identify bottlenecks in many domains, including road traffic
analysis and internet routing. We define the notion of neural Ricci curvature
and use it to identify bottleneck NN edges that are heavily used to ``transport
data"" to the NN outputs. We provide an evaluation on MNIST that illustrates
that such edges indeed occur more frequently for inputs where NNs are less
robust. These results will serve as the basis for an alternative method of
robust training, by minimizing the number of bottleneck edges.

Park et al. (Nature, 2023) suggests that publications and patents are becoming
less disruptive over time. Here we show that the reported decrease in
disruptiveness is an artifact of systematic shifts in the structure of citation
networks unrelated to innovation system capacity. Instead, the decline is
attributable to 'citation inflation', an unavoidable characteristic of real
citation networks that manifests as a systematic time-dependent bias and
renders cross-temporal analysis challenging. One driver of citation inflation
is the ever-increasing lengths of reference lists over time, which in turn
increases the density of links in citation networks, and causes the disruption
index to converge to 0. A second driver is attributable to shifts in the
construction of reference lists, which is increasingly impacted by
self-citations that increase in the rate of triadic closure in citation
networks, and thus confounds efforts to measure disruption, which is itself a
measure of triadic closure. Combined, these two systematic shifts render the
disruption index temporally biased, and unsuitable for cross-temporal analysis.
The impact of this systematic bias further stymies efforts to correlate
disruption to other measures that are also time-dependent, such as team size
and citation counts. In order to demonstrate this fundamental measurement
problem, we present three complementary lines of critique (deductive, empirical
and computational modeling), and also make available an ensemble of synthetic
citation networks that can be used to test alternative citation-based indices
for systematic bias.

  link prediction",cs.SI cs.AI cs.LG cs.NA math.NA,"  Learning good quality neural graph embeddings has long been achieved by
minimizing the point-wise mutual information (PMI) for co-occurring nodes in
simulated random walks. This design choice has been mostly popularized by the
direct application of the highly-successful word embedding algorithm word2vec
to predicting the formation of new links in social, co-citation, and biological
networks. However, such a skeuomorphic design of graph embedding methods
entails a truncation of information coming from pairs of nodes with low PMI. To
circumvent this issue, we propose an improved approach to learning low-rank
factorization embeddings that incorporate information from such unlikely pairs
of nodes and show that it can improve the link prediction performance of
baseline methods from 1.2% to 24.2%. Based on our results and observations we
outline further steps that could improve the design of next graph embedding
algorithms that are based on matrix factorization.

collaboration and scientific impact, using three indicators of collaboration
(number of authors, number of addresses, and number of countries) and including
articles published between 1900 and 2011. The results demonstrate that an
increase in the number of authors leads to an increase in impact--from the
beginning of the last century onwards--and that this is not simply due to
self-citations. A similar trend is also observed for the number of addresses
and number of countries represented in the byline of an article. However, the
constant inflation of collaboration since 1900 has resulted in diminishing
citation returns: larger and more diverse (in terms of institutional and
country affiliation) teams are necessary to realize higher impact. The paper
concludes with a discussion of the potential causes of the impact gain in
citations of collaborative papers.

  application to the field of library and information science",cs.DL,"  Two commonly used ideas in the development of citation-based research
performance indicators are the idea of normalizing citation counts based on a
field classification scheme and the idea of recursive citation weighing (like
in PageRank-inspired indicators). We combine these two ideas in a single
indicator, referred to as the recursive mean normalized citation score
indicator, and we study the validity of this indicator. Our empirical analysis
shows that the proposed indicator is highly sensitive to the field
classification scheme that is used. The indicator also has a strong tendency to
reinforce biases caused by the classification scheme. Based on these
observations, we advise against the use of indicators in which the idea of
normalization based on a field classification scheme and the idea of recursive
citation weighing are combined.

that aims to produce text that accurately cites or references a cited document
within a source document. In CTG, the generated text draws upon contextual cues
from both the source document and the cited paper, ensuring accurate and
relevant citation information is provided. Previous work in the field of
citation generation is mainly based on the text summarization of documents.
Following this, this paper presents a framework, and a comparative study to
demonstrate the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for the task of citation
generation. Also, we have shown the improvement in the results of citation
generation by incorporating the knowledge graph relations of the papers in the
prompt for the LLM to better learn the relationship between the papers. To
assess how well our model is performing, we have used a subset of standard
S2ORC dataset, which only consists of computer science academic research papers
in the English Language. Vicuna performs best for this task with 14.15 Meteor,
12.88 Rouge-1, 1.52 Rouge-2, and 10.94 Rouge-L. Also, Alpaca performs best, and

gnn_citations,graph neural networks for citation analysis,363,2204.01376,0.69223934,Synthetic Graph Generation to Benchmark Graph Learning,cs.LG cs.SI,"  Graph learning algorithms have attained state-of-the-art performance on many
graph analysis tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and
clustering. It has, however, become hard to track the field's burgeoning
progress. One reason is due to the very small number of datasets used in
practice to benchmark the performance of graph learning algorithms. This
shockingly small sample size (~10) allows for only limited scientific insight
into the problem.
  In this work, we aim to address this deficiency. We propose to generate
synthetic graphs, and study the behaviour of graph learning algorithms in a
controlled scenario. We develop a fully-featured synthetic graph generator that
allows deep inspection of different models. We argue that synthetic graph
generations allows for thorough investigation of algorithms and provides more
insights than overfitting on three citation datasets. In the case study, we
show how our framework provides insight into unsupervised and supervised graph
neural network models.

knowledge of the graph structure to generate meaningful representations of
large-scale network data. GNN stability is thus important as in real-world
scenarios there are typically uncertainties associated with the graph. We
analyze GNN stability using kernel objects called graphons. Graphons are both
limits of convergent graph sequences and generating models for deterministic
and stochastic graphs. Building upon the theory of graphon signal processing,
we define graphon neural networks and analyze their stability to graphon
perturbations. We then extend this analysis by interpreting the graphon neural
network as a generating model for GNNs on deterministic and stochastic graphs
instantiated from the original and perturbed graphons. We observe that GNNs are
stable to graphon perturbations with a stability bound that decreases
asymptotically with the size of the graph. This asymptotic behavior is further
demonstrated in an experiment of movie recommendation.

  Experiments with GROBID, GIANT and Cora",cs.LG cs.IR stat.ML,"  Citation parsing, particularly with deep neural networks, suffers from a lack
of training data as available datasets typically contain only a few thousand
training instances. Manually labelling citation strings is very time-consuming,
hence synthetically created training data could be a solution. However, as of
now, it is unknown if synthetically created reference-strings are suitable to
train machine learning algorithms for citation parsing. To find out, we train
Grobid, which uses Conditional Random Fields, with a) human-labelled reference
strings from 'real' bibliographies and b) synthetically created reference
strings from the GIANT dataset. We find that both synthetic and organic
reference strings are equally suited for training Grobid (F1 = 0.74). We
additionally find that retraining Grobid has a notable impact on its
performance, for both synthetic and real data (+30% in F1). Having as many
types of labelled fields as possible during training also improves
effectiveness, even if these fields are not available in the evaluation data
(+13.5% F1). We conclude that synthetic data is suitable for training (deep)
citation parsing models. We further suggest that in future evaluations of
reference parsers both evaluation data similar and dissimilar to the training
data should be used for more meaningful evaluations.

scientists are the total number of publication ($N_{pub}$), total number of
citations ($N_{cit}$) and the Hirsch (h) index. Since the seminal paper of
Hirsch, in 2005, it is largely debated whether the h index can be considered as
an indicator independent of $N_{pub}$ and $N_{cit}$. Exploiting the Paretian
form for the distribution of citations for the papers authored by a researcher,
here we discuss scaling relations between h, $N_{pub}$ and $N_{cit}$. The
analysis incorporates the Gini index as an inequality measure of citation
distributions and a recently proposed inequality kernel, gintropy (resembling
to the entropy kernel). We find a new upper bound for the h value as a function
of the total number of citations, confimed on massive data collected from
Google Scholar. Our analyses reveals also that the individualized Gini index
calculated for the citations received by the publications of an author peaks
around 0.8, a value much higher than the one characteristic for the usual
socio-economic inequalities.

  Citation Prediction",cs.DL cs.AI cs.CL,"  Citation networks are critical in modern science, and predicting which
previous papers (candidates) will a new paper (query) cite is a critical
problem. However, the roles of a paper's citations vary significantly, ranging
from foundational knowledge basis to superficial contexts. Distinguishing these
roles requires a deeper understanding of the logical relationships among
papers, beyond simple edges in citation networks. The emergence of LLMs with
textual reasoning capabilities offers new possibilities for discerning these
relationships, but there are two major challenges. First, in practice, a new
paper may select its citations from gigantic existing papers, where the texts
exceed the context length of LLMs. Second, logical relationships between papers
are implicit, and directly prompting an LLM to predict citations may result in
surface-level textual similarities rather than the deeper logical reasoning. In
this paper, we introduce the novel concept of core citation, which identifies
the critical references that go beyond superficial mentions. Thereby, we
elevate the citation prediction task from a simple binary classification to
distinguishing core citations from both superficial citations and
non-citations. To address this, we propose $\textbf{HLM-Cite}$, a
$\textbf{H}$ybrid $\textbf{L}$anguage $\textbf{M}$odel workflow for citation
prediction, which combines embedding and generative LMs. We design a curriculum
finetune procedure to adapt a pretrained text embedding model to coarsely
retrieve high-likelihood core citations from vast candidates and then design an
LLM agentic workflow to rank the retrieved papers through one-shot reasoning,
revealing the implicit relationships among papers. With the pipeline, we can
scale the candidate sets to 100K papers. We evaluate HLM-Cite across 19
scientific fields, demonstrating a 17.6% performance improvement comparing SOTA
methods.

graph-structured data. Many graph convolutional networks can be thought of as
low-pass filters for graph signals. In this paper, we propose a more powerful
graph convolutional network, named BiGCN, that extends to bidirectional
filtering. Specifically, we not only consider the original graph structure
information but also the latent correlation between features, thus BiGCN can
filter the signals along with both the original graph and a latent
feature-connection graph. Compared with most existing GCNs, BiGCN is more
robust and has powerful capacities for feature denoising. We perform node
classification and link prediction in citation networks and co-purchase
networks with three settings: noise-rate, noise-level and structure-mistakes.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms the
state-of-the-art graph neural networks in both clean and artificially noisy
data.

categorized as zero-shot out-of-graph all-links prediction. This challenging
problem aims to predict all links from a new, isolated, and unobserved node
that was previously disconnected from the graph. Unlike classic approaches to
link prediction (including few-shot out-of-graph link prediction), this problem
presents two key differences: (1) the new node has no existing links from which
to extract patterns for new predictions; and (2) the goal is to predict not
just one, but all the links of this new node, or at least a significant part of
them. Experiments demonstrate that an architecture based on Deep Graph Neural
Networks can learn to solve this challenging problem in a bibliographic

graph learning tasks such as graph classification and node classification.
Nevertheless, popular graph neural network models still struggle to capture
higher-order information, i.e., information that goes \emph{beyond} pairwise
interactions. Recent work has shown that persistent homology, a tool from
topological data analysis, can enrich graph neural networks with topological
information that they otherwise could not capture. Calculating such features is
efficient for dimension 0 (connected components) and dimension 1 (cycles).
However, when it comes to higher-order structures, it does not scale well, with
a complexity of $O(n^d)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes and $d$ is the order
of the structures. In this work, we introduce a novel method that extracts
information about higher-order structures in the graph while still using the
efficient low-dimensional persistent homology algorithm. On standard benchmark
datasets, we show that our method can lead to up to $31\%$ improvements in test
accuracy.

We investigate the influence of the preferential attachment rule (PAR) in this process by analysing individual citation events from the DBLP dataset and two Scopus-based datasets, enabling us to estimate the probability of citations being assigned preferentially. Our findings reveal that, for the aggregated dataset, PAR dominates the citation distribution process, with approximately 70% of citations adhering to this mechanism. However, analysis at the individual level shows significant variability, with some authors experiencing a greater prevalence of preferential citations, particularly in the context of external citations. In contrast, self-citations exhibit notably different behaviour, with only 20% following PAR. We also demonstrate that the prominence of PAR increases with an author's citability (average citations per paper), suggesting that more citable authors are preferentially cited, while less-cited authors experience more random citation patterns. Furthermore, we show that self-citations may influence bibliometric indices, such as the h-index. Our results confirm the distinct dynamics of self-citations compared to external citations, raising questions about the mechanisms driving self-citation patterns. These findings provide new insights into citation behaviours and highlight the limitations of existing approaches."

factorization algorithms in that it does not make a low rank assumption. This
makes MMF especially well suited to modeling certain types of graphs with
complex multiscale or hierarchical strucutre. While MMF promises to yields a
useful wavelet basis, finding the factorization itself is hard, and existing
greedy methods tend to be brittle. In this paper, we propose a ``learnable''
version of MMF that carfully optimizes the factorization using metaheuristics,
specifically evolutionary algorithms and directed evolution, along with Stiefel
manifold optimization through backpropagating errors. We show that the
resulting wavelet basis far outperforms prior MMF algorithms and gives
comparable performance on standard learning tasks on graphs. Furthermore, we
construct the wavelet neural networks (WNNs) learning graphs on the spectral
domain with the wavelet basis produced by our MMF learning algorithm. Our
wavelet networks are competitive against other state-of-the-art methods in
molecular graphs classification and node classification on citation graphs. We

recognized for several years after publication. Its citation history exhibits a
long hibernation period followed by a sudden spike of popularity. Previous
studies suggest a relative scarcity of SBs. The reliability of this conclusion
is, however, heavily dependent on identification methods based on arbitrary
threshold parameters for sleeping time and number of citations, applied to
small or monodisciplinary bibliographic datasets. Here we present a systematic,
large-scale, and multidisciplinary analysis of the SB phenomenon in science. We
introduce a parameter-free measure that quantifies the extent to which a
specific paper can be considered an SB. We apply our method to 22 million
scientific papers published in all disciplines of natural and social sciences
over a time span longer than a century. Our results reveal that the SB
phenomenon is not exceptional. There is a continuous spectrum of delayed
recognition where both the hibernation period and the awakening intensity are
taken into account. Although many cases of SBs can be identified by looking at
monodisciplinary bibliographic data, the SB phenomenon becomes much more
apparent with the analysis of multidisciplinary datasets, where we can observe
many examples of papers achieving delayed yet exceptional importance in
disciplines different from those where they were originally published. Our
analysis emphasizes a complex feature of citation dynamics that so far has
received little attention, and also provides empirical evidence against the use
of short-term citation metrics in the quantification of scientific impact.

provided the platform to address and solve complex problems using
interdisciplinary research. In this paper, we investigate how the extent of
interdisciplinarity in computer science domain (which is further divided into
24 research fields) has changed over the last 50 years. To this end, we collect
a massive bibliographic dataset with rich metadata information. We start with
quantifying interdisciplinarity of a field in terms of the diversity of topics
and citations. We then analyze the effect of interdisciplinary research on the
scientific impact of individual fields and observe that highly disciplinary and
highly interdisciplinary papers in general have a low scientific impact;
remarkably those that are able to strike a balance between the two extremes
eventually land up having the highest impact. Further, we study the reciprocity
among fields through citation interactions and notice that links from one field
to related and citation-intensive fields (fields producing large number of
citations) are reciprocated heavily. A systematic analysis of the citation
interactions reveals the life trajectory of a research field, which generally
undergoes three phases -- a growing phase, a matured phase and an
interdisciplinary phase. The combination of metrics and empirical observations
presented here provides general benchmarks for future studies of
interdisciplinary research activities in other domains of science.

  The problems of quantifying the meaning of texts and representation of human

This paper presents a novel method for vector representation of text meaning

for text classification on the basis of the Leicester Scientific Corpus.
  We describe the experimental framework used to evaluate the impact of
scientific articles through their informational semantics. Our interest is in
citation classification to discover how important semantics of texts are in

important factor for citation prediction.
  For each article, our system extracts the abstract of paper, represents the
words of the abstract as vectors in Meaning Space, automatically analyses the
distribution of scientific categories (Web of Science categories) within the
text of abstract, and then classifies papers according to citation counts
(highly-cited, little-cited).
  We show that an informational approach to representing the meaning of a text

count as first-order approximations of the scope of publications. Although both
metrics on average show positive correlations with citation count, single
author papers show no significant difference in page or reference counts
compared to the rest of the publications, suggesting that there exist other
factors that impact the citations of single author publications.

  citation",cs.DL cs.CL stat.AP,"  Evaluation of journals for quality is one of the dominant themes of
bibliometrics since journals are the primary venue of vetting and distribution
of scholarship. There are many criticisms of quantifying journal impact with
bibliometrics including disciplinary differences among journals, what source
materials are used, time windows for the inclusion of works to measure, and
skewness of citation distributions (Lariviere & Sugimoto, 2019). However,
despite various attempts to remediate these in newly proposed indicators such
as SJR, SNIP, and Eigenfactor (Walters, 2017) indicators still remain based on
citation counts and fail to acknowledge the critical differences that the type
of citation made, whether it's supporting or disputing a work when quantifying
journal impact. While various programs have been suggested to apply and
encompass citation content analysis within bibliometrics projects, citation
content analysis has not been done at the scale needed in order to supplement
quantitate journal citation analysis until the scite citation index was
produced. Using this citation index containing citation types based on citation
function (supporting, disputing, or mentioning) we present initial results on
the statistical characterization of citations to journals based on citation
function. We also present initial results of characterizing the ratio of
supports and disputes received by a journal as a potential indicator of quality
and show two interesting results: the ratio of supports and disputes do not
correlate with total citations and that the distribution of this ratio is not
skewed showing a normal distribution. We conclude with a proposal for future
research using citation analysis qualified by citation function as well as the
implications of performing bibliometrics tasks such as research evaluation and
information retrieval using citation function.

distance on knowledge flows. The flows are measured through the citations
exchanged between scientific publications, including and excluding
self-citations. To calculate geographic distances between citing and cited
publication, each publication is associated with a ""prevailing"" territory,
according to the authors' affiliations. We then apply a gravity model to
account for the research size of the territories, in terms of cognitive
proximity of citing-cited publications. The field of observation is the
2010-2017 world publications citing the 2010-2012 Italian publications, as
indexed in the Web of Science. The results show that in domestic knowledge
flows, geographic proximity remains an influential factor through time,
although with differences among disciplines and trends of attenuating effects.
Finally, we replicate the analyses of knowledge flows but with the exclusion of
self-citations: in this manner the effect of geographic proximity seems
reduced, particularly at the national scale, but the differences (with vs
without self-citations) lessen through time. As shown in previous works, the
effect of distance on continental flows is modest (imperceptible for
intercontinental flows), yet here too time has some influence, including
concerning exclusion of self-citations.

disciplines. While the transfer of knowledge is largely unobservable, citations
from one discipline to another have been proven to be an effective proxy to
study disciplinary knowledge flow. This study constructs a knowledge flow
network in that a node represents a Journal Citation Report subject category
and a link denotes the citations from one subject category to another. Using
the concept of shortest path, several quantitative measurements are proposed
and applied to a knowledge flow network. Based on an examination of subject
categories in Journal Citation Report, this paper finds that social science
domains tend to be more self-contained and thus it is more difficult for
knowledge from other domains to flow into them; at the same time, knowledge
from science domains, such as biomedicine-, chemistry-, and physics-related
domains can access and be accessed by other domains more easily. This paper
also finds that social science domains are more disunified than science
domains, as three fifths of the knowledge paths from one social science domain
to another need at least one science domain to serve as an intermediate. This
paper contributes to discussions on disciplinarity and interdisciplinarity by
providing empirical analysis.

crucial for the scientific community with respect to reproducibility and
attribution of its developers. Several studies have investigated in-text
mentions of software and its quality, while the quality of formal software
citations has only been analyzed superficially. This study performs an in-depth
evaluation of formal software citation based on a set of manually annotated
software references. It examines which resources are cited for software usage,
to what extend they allow proper identification of software and its specific
version, how this information is made available by scientific publishers, and
how well it is represented in large-scale bibliographic databases. The results
show that software articles are the most cited resource for software, while
direct software citations are better suited for identification of software
versions. Moreover, we found current practices by both, publishers and
bibliographic databases, to be unsuited to represent these direct software
citations, hindering large-scale analyses such as assessing software impact. We
argue that current practices for representing software citations -- the
recommended way to cite software by current citation standards -- stand in the
way of their adaption by the scientific community, and urge providers of
bibliographic data to explicitly model scientific software.

better understand these reciprocal relationships, we analysed the reciprocal
sub-graphs of acknowledgement from two perspectives: citations and gender
diversity. Firstly, we counted the number of citations, from both reciprocal
and non-reciprocal authors. We found that reciprocal authors predominantly tend
to cite other reciprocal authors rather than non-reciprocal ones. For gender
diversity, we found that reciprocal pairs that include females tend to emerge
more than male-male pairs of reciprocity in various fields, despite the fewer
number of females.

important to allow robust and powerful quantitative analyses. Whilst previous
studies have suggested that both the hooked power law and discretised lognormal
distributions fit better than the power law and negative binomial
distributions, no comparisons so far have covered all articles within a
discipline, including those that are uncited. Based on an analysis of 26
different Scopus subject areas in seven different years, this article reports
comparisons of the discretised lognormal and the hooked power law with citation
data, adding 1 to citation counts in order to include zeros. The hooked power
law fits better in two thirds of the subject/year combinations tested for
journal articles that are at least three years old, including most medical,
life and natural sciences, and for virtually all subject areas for younger
articles. Conversely, the discretised lognormal tends to fit best for arts,
humanities, social science and engineering fields. The difference between the
fits of the distributions is mostly small, however, and so either could
reasonably be used for modelling citation data. For regression analyses,
however, the best option is to use ordinary least squares regression applied to
the natural logarithm of citation counts plus one, especially for sets of
younger articles, because of the increased precision of the parameters.

impact relative to other papers in a given citation distribution. Percentile
Ranks (PRs) often play an important role in evaluating the impact of scholars,
institutions, and lines of study. Because PRs are so important for the
assessment of scholarly impact, and because citation practices differ greatly
across time and fields, various percentile approaches have been proposed to
time- and field-normalize citations. Unfortunately, current popular methods
often face significant problems in time- and field-normalization, including
when papers are assigned to multiple fields or have been published by more than
one unit (e.g., researchers or countries). They also face problems for
estimating citation counts (CCs) for pre-defined PRs (e.g., the 90th PR). We
offer a series of guidelines and procedures that, we argue, address these
problems and others and provide a superior means to make the use of percentile
methods more accurate and informative. In particular, we introduce two
approaches, CP-IN and CP-EX, that should be preferred in bibliometric studies
because they consider the complete citation distribution. Both approaches are
based on cumulative frequencies in percentages (CPs). The paper further shows
how bar graphs and beamplots can present PRs in a more meaningful and accurate
manner.

fields of science is not warranted. Although many fields indeed seem to have
fairly similar citation distributions, there are quite some exceptions as well.
We also briefly discuss the consequences of our findings for the measurement of
scientific impact using citation-based bibliometric indicators.

  measurements and modeling",cs.DL physics.data-an physics.soc-ph,"  To quantify the mechanism of a complex network growth we focus on the network
of citations of scientific papers and use a combination of the theoretical and
experimental tools to uncover microscopic details of this network growth.
Namely, we develop a stochastic model of citation dynamics based on
copying/redirection/triadic closure mechanism. In a complementary and coherent
way, the model accounts both for statistics of references of scientific papers
and for their citation dynamics. Originating in empirical measurements, the
model is cast in such a way that it can be verified quantitatively in every
aspect. Such verification is performed by measuring citation dynamics of
Physics papers. The measurements revealed nonlinear citation dynamics, the
nonlinearity being intricately related to network topology. The nonlinearity
has far-reaching consequences including non-stationary citation distributions,
diverging citation trajectory of similar papers, runaways or ""immortal papers""
with infinite citation lifetime etc. Thus, our most important finding is
nonlinearity in complex network growth. In a more specific context, our results
can be a basis for quantitative probabilistic prediction of citation dynamics
of individual papers and of the journal impact factor.

connectivity in healthy children or autistic youths? What patterns in global
trade networks are shared across classes of goods, and how do these patterns
change over time? Answering questions like these requires us to differentially
describe groups of graphs: Given a set of graphs and a partition of these
graphs into groups, discover what graphs in one group have in common, how they
systematically differ from graphs in other groups, and how multiple groups of
graphs are related. We refer to this task as graph group analysis, which seeks
to describe similarities and differences between graph groups by means of
statistically significant subgraphs. To perform graph group analysis, we
introduce Gragra, which uses maximum entropy modeling to identify a
non-redundant set of subgraphs with statistically significant associations to
one or more graph groups. Through an extensive set of experiments on a wide
range of synthetic and real-world graph groups, we confirm that Gragra works
well in practice.

By integrating data from OpenAlex and Crossref, we analyze open science indicators such as the presence of a pre-print, data sharing, and software sharing in 576,537 publications in the FOSM dataset. Our analysis reveals a positive correlation between these OSI and citation counts. Considering our most complete citation prediction model, we find pre-prints are correlated with a significant positive effect of 19% on citation counts, software sharing of 13.5%, and data sharing of 14.3%. We find large variations in the correlations of OSIs with citations in different research disciplines, and observe that open access status of publications is correlated with a 8.6% increase in citations in our model. While these results remain observational and are limited to the scope of the analysis, they suggest a consistent correlation between citation advantages and open science indicators. Our results may be valuable to policy makers, funding agencies, researchers, publishers, institutions, and other stakeholders who are interested in understanding the academic impacts, or effects, of open science practices."

Asynchronous Recurrent Graph Neural Networks (ARGNNs) stand out for their

  excellence",cs.DL physics.soc-ph,"  In reaction to a previous critique(Opthof & Leydesdorff, 2010), the Center
for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS) in Leiden proposed to change their

(2011)argue that this change does not affect rankings at various aggregated

In this correspondence, we use previously published data of Van Raan (2006) to
address the pivotal issue of how the results of citation analysis correlate
with the results of peer review. A quality parameter based on peer review was
neither significantly correlated with the two parameters developed by the CWTS
in the past (CPP/JCSm or CPP/FCSm) nor with the more recently proposed h-index
(Hirsch, 2005). Given the high correlations between the old and new ""crown""
indicators, one can expect that the lack of correlation with the peer-review

  Influence Dispersion Trees",cs.DL cs.SI,"  Despite a long history of use of citation count as a measure to assess the
impact or influence of a scientific paper, the evolution of follow-up work
inspired by the paper and their interactions through citation links have rarely
been explored to quantify how the paper enriches the depth and breadth of a
research field. We propose a novel data structure, called Influence Dispersion
Tree (IDT) to model the organization of follow-up papers and their dependencies
through citations. We also propose the notion of an ideal IDT for every paper
and show that an ideal (highly influential) paper should increase the knowledge
of a field vertically and horizontally. Upon suitably exploring the structural
properties of IDT, we derive a suite of metrics, namely Influence Dispersion
Index (IDI), Normalized Influence Divergence (NID) to quantify the influence of
a paper. Our theoretical analysis shows that an ideal IDT configuration should
have equal depth and breadth (and thus minimize the NID value). We establish
the superiority of NID as a better influence measure in two experimental
settings. First, on a large real-world bibliographic dataset, we show that NID
outperforms raw citation count as an early predictor of the number of new
citations a paper will receive within a certain period after publication.
Second, we show that NID is superior to the raw citation count at identifying
the papers recognized as highly influential through Test of Time Award among
all their contemporary papers (published in the same venue). We conclude that
in order to quantify the influence of a paper, along with the total citation
count, one should also consider how the citing papers are organized among
themselves to better understand the influence of a paper on the research field.
For reproducibility, the code and datasets used in this study are being made

indicators of transitions in 2012 (between 2011 and 2013) are studied using
methodologies based on entropy statistics. Changes can be indicated at the
level of journals using the margin totals of entropy production along the row
or column vectors, but also at the level of links among journals by importing
the transition matrices into network analysis and visualization programs (and
using community-finding algorithms). Seventy-four journals are flagged in terms
of discontinuous changes in their citations; but 3,114 journals are involved in
""hot"" links. Most of these links are embedded in a main component; 78 clusters
(containing 172 journals) are flagged as potential ""hot spots"" emerging at the

are elaborated using an example. The results of the study indicate where
developments in the citation dynamics can be considered as significantly

substantively can be expected to vary from case to case.

great descriptive power. In this work we provide a method for embedding
directed acyclic graphs into Minkowski spacetime using Multidimensional scaling
(MDS). First we generalise the classical MDS algorithm, defined only for
metrics with a Euclidean signature, to manifolds of any metric signature. We
then use this general method to develop an algorithm to be used on networks
which have causal structure allowing them to be embedded in Lorentzian
manifolds. The method is demonstrated by calculating embeddings for both causal
sets and citation networks in Minkowski spacetime. We finally suggest a number
of applications in citation analysis such as paper recommendation, identifying
missing citations and fitting citation models to data using this geometric
approach.

interest such as author, title, and venue. Extracting such fields from
citations is crucial for citation indexing, researcher profile analysis, etc.
User-generated resources like academic homepages and Curriculum Vitae, provide
rich citation field information. However, extracting fields from these
resources is challenging due to inconsistent citation styles, incomplete
sentence syntax, and insufficient training data. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel algorithm, CIFAL (citation field learning by anchor
learning), to boost the citation field learning performance. CIFAL leverages
the anchor learning, which is model-agnostic for any Pre-trained Language
Model, to help capture citation patterns from the data of different citation
styles. The experiments demonstrate that CIFAL outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in citation field learning, achieving a 2.68% improvement in
field-level F1-scores. Extensive analysis of the results further confirms the
effectiveness of CIFAL quantitatively and qualitatively.

for measuring the performance of 68 highly cited papers, from the Journal of
the American Medical Informatics Association indexed in Web of Sciences (WoS),
from 2009 to 2019 were investigated. In the first step, a Pearson correlation
analysis is performed to eliminate variables with zero or weak correlation with
the target (dependent) variable ([number of citations in WOS]). Consequently,
32 variables are selected for the next step. By applying the Ridge technique,
13 features show a positive effect on the number of citations. Using three
different algorithms, i.e., Ridge, Lasso, and Boruta, 6 factors appear to be
the most relevant ones. The [Number of citations by international researchers],
[Journal self-citations in citing documents], and [Authors' self-citations in
citing documents], are recognized as the most important features by all three
methods here used. The [First author's scientific age], [Open-access paper],
and [Number of first author's citations in WOS] are identified as the important
features of highly cited papers by only two methods, Ridge and Lasso. Notice
that we use specific machine learning algorithms as feature selection methods
(Ridge, Lasso, and Boruta) to identify the most important features of highly
cited papers, tools that had not previously been used for this purpose. In
conclusion, we re-emphasize the performance resulting from such algorithms.
Moreover, we do not advise authors to seek to increase the citations of their

However, existing approaches often overlook the rich structural and semantic relevance among scientific literature, limiting their ability to discern the relationships between pieces of scientific knowledge, and suffer from various types of hallucinations. These methods also focus narrowly on individual downstream tasks, limiting their applicability across use cases. Here we propose LitFM, the first literature foundation model designed for a wide variety of practical downstream tasks on domain-specific literature, with a focus on citation information. At its core, LitFM contains a novel graph retriever to integrate graph structure by navigating citation graphs and extracting relevant literature, thereby enhancing model reliability. LitFM also leverages a knowledge-infused LLM, fine-tuned through a well-developed instruction paradigm. It enables LitFM to extract domain-specific knowledge from literature and reason relationships among them. By integrating citation graphs during both training and inference, LitFM can generalize to unseen papers and accurately assess their relevance within existing literature. Additionally, we introduce new large-scale literature citation benchmark datasets on three academic fields, featuring sentence-level citation information and local context. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of LitFM, achieving 28.1% improvement on retrieval task in precision, and an average improvement of 7.52% over state-of-the-art across six downstream literature-related tasks"

high or low citation impact compared to other papers, the standard practice in

the background of these proposals this study describes an ideal solution for
the normalization of citation impact: in a first step, the reference set for
the publication in question is collated by means of a classification scheme,
where every publication is associated with a single principal research field or
subfield entry (e. g. via Chemical Abstracts sections) and a publication year.
In a second step, percentiles of citation counts are calculated for this set
and used to assign the normalized citation impact score to the publications
(and also to the publication in question).

Due to the fact that the count variable exhibits substantial variation since the sample variance is larger than the sample mean, the classical Poisson regression model seems not to be appropriate. We concentrate attention on the negative binomial regression model, which allows the variance of each measurement to be a function of its predicted value. Nevertheless, the process of citations of papers may be divided into two parts. In the first stage, the paper has no citations, and the second part provides the intensity of the citations. A hurdle model for separating the documents with citations and those without citations is considered. The dataset for the empirical application consisted of 43,190 research papers in the field of Economics and Business from 2014-2021, obtained from The Lens database. Citation counts and social attention scores for each article were gathered from Altmetric database. The main findings indicate that both collaboration and funding have a positive impact on citation counts and reduce the likelihood of receiving zero citations. Higher journal impact factors lead to higher citation counts, while lower peer review ratings lead to fewer citations and a higher probability of zero citations. Mentions in news, blogs, and social media have varying but generally limited effects on citation counts. Open access via repositories (green OA) correlates with higher citation counts and a lower probability of zero citations. In contrast, OA via the publisher's website without an explicit open license (bronze OA) is associated with higher citation counts but also with a higher probability of zero citations."

associations of two national culture models with citation impact of nations
(measured by the proportion of papers belonging to the 10% and 1% most cited
papers in the corresponding fields, PPtop 10% and PPtop 1%). Bivariate
statistical analyses showed that of six Hofstede's national culture dimensions
(HNCD), uncertainty avoidance and power distance had a statistically
significant negative associa-tion, while individualism and indulgence had a
statistically significant positive associationwith both citation impact

multiple regression analyses controlling for the possible effects of
confounding factors including national self-citations, international
co-authorships, invest-ments in research and development, international migrant
stock, number of researchers ofeach nation, language, and productivity. The
results revealed that the statistically significant associations of HNCD with
citation impact indicators disappeared. But the statistically significant
relationship between survivals versus self-expression values and citation
impact indicators remained stable even after controlling for the confounding
variables. Thus, the freedom of expression and trust in society might
contribute to better scholarly communication systems, higher level of
international collaborations, and further quality research.

Despite the long-standing interests and its broad impact, we lack systematic
answers to this simple yet fundamental question. By reviewing and classifying
prior studies for the past 50 years, we find a significant lack of consensus in
the literature, primarily due to the coexistence of retrospective and
prospective approaches to measuring citation age distributions. These two
approaches have been pursued in parallel, lacking any known connections between
the two. Here we developed a new theoretical framework that not only allows us
to connect the two approaches through precise mathematical relationships, it
also helps us reconcile the interplay between temporal decay of citations and
the growth of science, helping us uncover new functional forms characterizing
citation age distributions. We find retrospective distribution follows a
lognormal distribution with exponential cutoff, while prospective distribution
is governed by the interplay between a lognormal distribution and the growth in
the number of references. Most interestingly, the two approaches can be
connected once rescaled by the growth of publications and citations. We further
validate our framework using both large-scale citation datasets and analytical
models capturing citation dynamics. Together this paper presents a
comprehensive analysis of the time dimension of science, representing a new
empirical and theoretical basis for all future studies in this area.

of author attributes such as country of affiliation and gender. While recent
studies have quantified citation imbalance in terms of the authors' gender in
journal papers, the computer science discipline, where researchers frequently
present their work at conferences, may exhibit unique patterns in gendered
citation imbalance. Additionally, understanding how network properties in
citations influence citation imbalances remains challenging due to a lack of
suitable reference models. In this paper, we develop a family of reference
models for citation networks and investigate gender imbalance in citations
between papers published in computer science conferences. By deploying these
reference models, we found that homophily in citations is strongly associated
with gendered citation imbalance in computer science, whereas heterogeneity in
the number of citations received per paper has a relatively minor association
with it. Furthermore, we found that the gendered citation imbalance is most
pronounced in papers published in the highest-ranked conferences, is present
across different subfields, and extends to citation-based rankings of papers.
Our study provides a framework for investigating associations between network
properties and citation imbalances, aiming to enhance our understanding of the
structure and dynamics of citations between research publications.

These analyses rest on the assumption that citation decisions by authors are accurate, representing flow of knowledge from cited to citing papers. However, in practice, researchers often cite for reasons other than attributing intellectual credit to previous research. Citations made for rhetorical reasons or without reading the cited work compromise the value of citations as instrument for research evaluation. Past research on threats to the accuracy of citations has mainly focused on citation bias as the primary concern. In this paper, we argue that citation noise - the undesirable variance in citation decisions - represents an equally critical but underexplored challenge in citation analysis. We define and differentiate two types of citation noise: citation level noise and citation pattern noise. Each type of noise is described in terms of how it arises and the specific ways it can undermine the validity of citation-based research assessments. By conceptually differing citation noise from citation accuracy and citation bias, we propose a framework for the foundation of citation analysis. We discuss strategies and interventions to minimize citation noise, aiming to improve the reliability and validity of citation analysis in research evaluation. We recommend that the current professional reform movement in research evaluation such as the Coalition for Advancing Research Assessment (CoARA) pick up these strategies and interventions as an additional building block for careful, responsible use of bibliometric indicators in research evaluation."

custom language model to construct knowledge graphs that map economic concepts
and their relationships. We distinguish between general claims and those
documented via causal inference methods (e.g., DiD, IV, RDD, RCTs). We document
a substantial rise in the share of causal claims-from roughly 4% in 1990 to
nearly 28% in 2020-reflecting the growing influence of the ""credibility
revolution."" We find that causal narrative complexity (e.g., the depth of
causal chains) strongly predicts both publication in top-5 journals and higher
citation counts, whereas non-causal complexity tends to be uncorrelated or
negatively associated with these outcomes. Novelty is also pivotal for top-5
publication, but only when grounded in credible causal methods: introducing
genuinely new causal edges or paths markedly increases both the likelihood of
acceptance at leading outlets and long-run citations, while non-causal novelty
exhibits weak or even negative effects. Papers engaging with central, widely
recognized concepts tend to attract more citations, highlighting a divergence
between factors driving publication success and long-term academic impact.
Finally, bridging underexplored concept pairs is rewarded primarily when
grounded in causal methods, yet such gap filling exhibits no consistent link
with future citations. Overall, our findings suggest that methodological rigor
and causal innovation are key drivers of academic recognition, but sustained
impact may require balancing novel contributions with conceptual integration
into established economic discourse.

but that this effect falls off rapidly for longer distances in the
co-authorship network. The exchange of citation between pairs with $d=1$
exhibits a sudden increase at the time of first co-authorship events and decays
thereafter, indicating an aging effect in collaboration. This suggests that the
dynamics of the co-authorship network appear to be driving those of the
citation network rather than vice versa. Moreover, the majority of citations
received by most authors are due to reciprocal citations from current, or past,
co-authors. We conclude that, in order to answer questions on nature and
dynamics of scientific collaboration, it is necessary to study both
co-authorship and citation network simultaneously.

gnn_citations,graph neural networks for citation analysis,415,2002.06974,0.6878598,The inconsistency of h-index: a mathematical analysis,cs.DL,"  Citation distributions are lognormal. We use 30 lognormally distributed
synthetic series of numbers that simulate real series of citations to
investigate the consistency of the h index. Using the lognormal cumulative
distribution function, the equation that defines the h index can be formulated;
this equation shows that h has a complex dependence on the number of papers
(N). We also investigate the correlation between h and the number of papers
exceeding various citation thresholds, from 5 to 500 citations. The best
correlation is for the 100 threshold but numerous data points deviate from the
general trend. The size-independent indicator h/N shows no correlation with the
probability of publishing a paper exceeding any of the citation thresholds. In
contrast with the h index, the total number of citations shows a high
correlation with the number of papers exceeding the thresholds of 10 and 50
citations; the mean number of citations correlates with the probability of
publishing a paper that exceeds any level of citations. Thus, in synthetic
series, the number of citations and the mean number of citations are much
better indicators of research performance than h and h/N. We discuss that in
real citation distributions there are other difficulties.

gnn_citations,graph neural networks for citation analysis,416,2310.01267,0.68762267,Cooperative Graph Neural Networks,cs.LG cs.AI,"  Graph neural networks are popular architectures for graph machine learning,
based on iterative computation of node representations of an input graph
through a series of invariant transformations. A large class of graph neural
networks follow a standard message-passing paradigm: at every layer, each node
state is updated based on an aggregate of messages from its neighborhood. In
this work, we propose a novel framework for training graph neural networks,
where every node is viewed as a player that can choose to either 'listen',
'broadcast', 'listen and broadcast', or to 'isolate'. The standard message
propagation scheme can then be viewed as a special case of this framework where
every node 'listens and broadcasts' to all neighbors. Our approach offers a
more flexible and dynamic message-passing paradigm, where each node can
determine its own strategy based on their state, effectively exploring the
graph topology while learning. We provide a theoretical analysis of the new
message-passing scheme which is further supported by an extensive empirical
analysis on a synthetic dataset and on real-world datasets.

citations, in an attempt to paint a sharper picture of fairness issues related
to prepublishing. A paper's citation count is estimated using a
negative-binomial generalized linear model (GLM) while observing a binary
variable which indicates whether the paper has been prepublished. We control
for author influence (via the authors' h-index at the time of paper writing),
publication venue, and overall time that paper has been available on arXiv. Our
analysis only includes papers that were eventually accepted for publication at
top-tier CS conferences, and were posted on arXiv either before or after the
acceptance notification. We observe that papers submitted to arXiv before
acceptance have, on average, 65\% more citations in the following year compared
to papers submitted after. We note that this finding is not causal, and discuss
possible next steps.

information seeking, but their generated outputs are prone to hallucination. In
this work, our aim is to allow LLMs to generate text with citations, improving
their factual correctness and verifiability. Existing work mainly relies on
commercial search engines and human evaluation, making it challenging to
reproduce and compare different modeling approaches. We propose ALCE, the first
benchmark for Automatic LLMs' Citation Evaluation. ALCE collects a diverse set
of questions and retrieval corpora and requires building end-to-end systems to
retrieve supporting evidence and generate answers with citations. We develop
automatic metrics along three dimensions -- fluency, correctness, and citation
quality -- and demonstrate their strong correlation with human judgements. Our
experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs and novel prompting strategies show that
current systems have considerable room for improvement -- For example, on the
ELI5 dataset, even the best models lack complete citation support 50% of the
time. Our analyses further highlight promising future directions, including
developing better retrievers, advancing long-context LLMs, and improving the
ability to synthesize information from multiple sources.

scientific knowledge, facilitating literature reviews, and identifying emerging
research trends. However, manual taxonomy construction is labor-intensive,
time-consuming, and prone to human biases, often overlooking pivotal but
less-cited papers. In this paper, to enable automatic hierarchical taxonomy
generation from citation graphs, we propose HiGTL (Hierarchical Graph Taxonomy
Learning), a novel end-to-end framework guided by human-provided instructions
or preferred topics. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical citation graph
clustering method that recursively groups related papers based on both textual
content and citation structure, ensuring semantically meaningful and
structurally coherent clusters. Additionally, we develop a novel taxonomy node
verbalization strategy that iteratively generates central concepts for each
cluster, leveraging a pre-trained large language model (LLM) to maintain
semantic consistency across hierarchical levels. To further enhance
performance, we design a joint optimization framework that fine-tunes both the
clustering and concept generation modules, aligning structural accuracy with
the quality of generated taxonomies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
HiGTL effectively produces coherent, high-quality taxonomies.

  Mass Points at Lower Values",stat.ME cs.DL,"  Quantile regression presents a complete picture of the effects on the
location, scale, and shape of the dependent variable at all points, not just
the mean. We focus on two challenges for citation count analysis by quantile
regression: discontinuity and substantial mass points at lower counts. A
Bayesian hurdle quantile regression model for count data with a substantial
mass point at zero was proposed by King and Song (2019). It uses quantile
regression for modeling the nonzero data and logistic regression for modeling
the probability of zeros versus nonzeros. We show that substantial mass points
for low citation counts will nearly certainly also affect parameter estimation
in the quantile regression part of the model, similar to a mass point at zero.
We update the King and Song model by shifting the hurdle point past the main
mass points. This model delivers more accurate quantile regression for
moderately to highly cited articles, especially at quantiles corresponding to
values just beyond the mass points, and enables estimates of the extent to
which factors influence the chances that an article will be low cited. To
illustrate the potential of this method, it is applied to simulated citation
counts and data from Scopus.

  Technical Note",cs.IR,"  Patent retrieval influences several applications within engineering design
research, education, and practice as well as applications that concern
innovation, intellectual property, and knowledge management etc. In this
article, we propose a method to retrieve patents relevant to an initial set of
patents, by synthesizing state-of-the-art techniques among natural language
processing and knowledge graph embedding. Our method involves a patent
embedding that captures text, citation, and inventor information, which
individually represent different facets of knowledge communicated through a
patent document. We obtain text embeddings using Sentence-BERT applied to
titles and abstracts. We obtain citation and inventor embeddings through TransE
that is trained using the corresponding knowledge graphs. We identify using a
classification task that the concatenation of text, citation, and inventor
embeddings offers a plausible representation of a patent. While the proposed
patent embedding could be used to associate a pair of patents, we observe using
a recall task that multiple initial patents could be associated with a target
patent using mean cosine similarity, which could then be utilized to rank all
target patents and retrieve the most relevant ones. We apply the proposed
patent retrieval method to a set of patents corresponding to a product family
and an inventor's portfolio.

However, this does not hold for citation failure, when a model generates a helpful response, but fails to cite complete evidence. In contrast to previous work, we propose to disentangle this from response failure, where the response itself is flawed, and citing complete evidence is impossible. To address citation failure, this work follows a two-step approach: (1) We study when citation failure occurs and (2) how it can be mitigated. For step 1, we extend prior work by investigating how the relation between response and evidence affects citation quality. We introduce CITECONTROL, a benchmark that systematically varies this relation to analyze failure modes. Experiments show that failures increase with relational complexity and suggest that combining citation methods could improve performance, motivating step 2. To improve LLM citation efficiently, we propose CITENTION, a framework integrating generative, attention-based, and retrieval-based methods. Results demonstrate substantial citation improvements on CITECONTROL and in transfer settings. We make our data and code publicly available."

  Aggregation from Citation Papers",cs.CL cs.AI,"  Abstracts derived from biomedical literature possess distinct domain-specific
characteristics, including specialised writing styles and biomedical
terminologies, which necessitate a deep understanding of the related
literature. As a result, existing language models struggle to generate
technical summaries that are on par with those produced by biomedical experts,
given the absence of domain-specific background knowledge. This paper aims to
enhance the performance of language models in biomedical abstractive

that integrates domain-specific knowledge from citation papers, allowing neural
networks to generate summaries by leveraging both the paper content and
relevant knowledge from citation papers. Furthermore, we construct and release
a large-scale biomedical summarisation dataset that serves as a foundation for

neural networks have been used for various applications, their adaptivity to
reject option setting is not previously explored. In this paper, we propose
NCwR, a novel approach to node classification in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
with an integrated reject option, which allows the model to abstain from making
predictions when uncertainty is high. We propose both cost-based and
coverage-based methods for classification with abstention in node
classification setting using GNNs. We perform experiments using our method on
three standard citation network datasets Cora, Citeseer and Pubmed and compare
with relevant baselines. We also model the Legal judgment prediction problem on

and edges represent citations. We further interpret the model by analyzing the
cases that the model abstains from predicting by visualizing which part of the
input features influenced this decision.

gnn_citations,graph neural networks for citation analysis,429,2402.18054,0.68604785,Contextualizing Generated Citation Texts,cs.CL,"  Abstractive citation text generation is usually framed as an infilling task,
where a sequence-to-sequence model is trained to generate a citation given a
reference paper and the context window around the target; the generated
citation should be a brief discussion of the reference paper as it relates to
the citing context. However, examining a recent LED-based citation generation
system, we find that many of the generated citations are generic summaries of
the reference papers main contribution, ignoring the citation contexts focus on
a different topic. To address this problem, we propose a simple modification to
the citation text generation task: the generation target is not only the
citation itself, but the entire context window, including the target citation.
This approach can be easily applied to any abstractive citation generation
system, and our experimental results show that training in this way is
preferred by human readers and allows the generation model to make use of
contextual clues about what topic to discuss and what stance to take.

many cases where graphs are unavailable, existing methods manually construct

spectral graph theory, we propose the objective of graph learning from a
sparsity constraint, properties of a valid adjacency matrix as well as a graph
Laplacian regularizer via maximum a posteriori estimation. The optimization
objective is then integrated into the loss function of the GCNN, which adapts
the graph topology to not only labels of a specific task but also the input

institutions across the world, but the probability distributions of citations
for individual institutions can be rescaled to a common form by scaling the
citations by the average number of citations for that institution. We find this
feature seem to be universal for a broad selection of institutions irrespective
of the average number of citations per article. A similar analysis for
citations to publications in a particular journal in a single year reveals
similar results. We find high absolute inequality for both these sets, Gini

At the same time, data citation is essential for maintaining academic integrity, acknowledging contributions, validating research outcomes, and fostering scientific reproducibility. As a critical link, it connects scholarly publications with the datasets that drive scientific progress. This study investigates whether repository visibility influences data citation rates. We hypothesize that repositories with higher visibility, as measured by search engine metrics, are associated with increased dataset citations. Using OpenAlex data and repository impact indicators (including the visibility index from Sistrix, the h-index of repositories, and citation metrics such as mean and median citations), we analyze datasets in Social Sciences and Economics to explore their relationship. Our findings suggest that datasets hosted on more visible web domains tend to receive more citations, with a positive correlation observed between web domain visibility and dataset citation counts, particularly for datasets with at least one citation. However, when analyzing domain-level citation metrics, such as the h-index, mean, and median citations, the correlations are inconsistent and weaker. While higher visibility domains tend to host datasets with greater citation impact, the distribution of citations across datasets varies significantly. These results suggest that while visibility plays a role in increasing citation counts, it is not the sole factor influencing dataset citation impact. Other elements, such as dataset quality, research trends, and disciplinary norms, can also contribute to citation patterns."

analyses. First, we examine the Academic Knowledge API (AK API), an interface
to access MA data, and compare it to Google Scholar (GS). Second, we perform a
comparative citation analysis of researchers by normalizing data from MA and
Scopus. We find that MA offers structured and rich metadata, which facilitates
data retrieval, handling and processing. In addition, the AK API allows
retrieving frequency distributions of citations. We consider these features to
be a major advantage of MA over GS. However, we identify four main limitations
regarding the available metadata. First, MA does not provide the document type
of a publication. Second, the 'fields of study' are dynamic, too specific and
field hierarchies are incoherent. Third, some publications are assigned to
incorrect years. Fourth, the metadata of some publications did not include all
authors. Nevertheless, we show that an average-based indicator (i.e. the
journal normalized citation score; JNCS) as well as a distribution-based
indicator (i.e. percentile rank classes; PR classes) can be calculated with
relative ease using MA. Hence, normalization of citation counts is feasible
with MA. The citation analyses in MA and Scopus yield uniform results. The JNCS
and the PR classes are similar in both databases, and, as a consequence, the
evaluation of the researchers' publication impact is congruent in MA and
Scopus. Given the fast development in the last year, we postulate that MA has
the potential to be used for full-fledged bibliometric analyses.

  ranking",physics.soc-ph cs.SI,"  Community detection helps us simplify the complex configuration of networks,
but communities are reliable only if they are statistically significant. To
detect statistically significant communities, a common approach is to resample
the original network and analyze the communities. But resampling assumes
independence between samples, while the components of a network are inherently
dependent. Therefore, we must understand how breaking dependencies between
resampled components affects the results of the significance analysis. Here we
use scientific communication as a model system to analyze this effect. Our
dataset includes citations among articles published in journals in the years
1984-2010. We compare parametric resampling of citations with non-parametric
article resampling. While citation resampling breaks link dependencies, article
resampling maintains such dependencies. We find that citation resampling
underestimates the variance of link weights. Moreover, this underestimation
explains most of the differences in the significance analysis of ranking and
clustering. Therefore, when only link weights are available and article
resampling is not an option, we suggest a simple parametric resampling scheme
that generates link-weight variances close to the link-weight variances of
article resampling. Nevertheless, when we highlight and summarize important
structural changes in science, the more dependencies we can maintain in the
resampling scheme, the earlier we can predict structural change.

with the average reciprocity computed in an ensemble of null network models. We
show that obtaining citations through reciprocity correlates negatively with a
successful career in the long term. Nevertheless, at the aggregate level we
show evidence of a steady increase in reciprocity over the years, largely
fuelled by the exchange of citations between coauthors. Our results
characterize the structure of author networks in a time of increasing emphasis
on citation-based indicators, and we discuss their implications towards a

size numerical vectors as inputs.
  This paper proposes an approach to analyze GNNs by converting them into FFNNs
and reusing existing FFNNs analyses. We discuss various designs to ensure the
scalability and accuracy of the conversions. We illustrate our method on a

search and optimization algorithms should support distributed parameter
evaluations to reduce cumulative runtime. Intel's neuromorphic optimization
library, Lava-Optimization, was introduced as an abstract optimization system
compatible with neuromorphic systems developed in the broader Lava software
framework. In this work, we introduce Lava Multi-Agent Optimization (LMAO) with
native support for distributed parameter evaluations communicating with a
central Bayesian optimization system. LMAO provides an abstract framework for
deploying distributed optimization and search algorithms within the Lava
software framework. Moreover, LMAO introduces support for random and grid
search along with process connections across multiple levels of mathematical
precision. We evaluate the algorithmic performance of LMAO with a traditional
non-convex optimization problem, a fixed-precision transductive spiking graph
neural network for citation graph classification, and a neuromorphic satellite
scheduling problem. Our results highlight LMAO's efficient scaling to multiple
processes, reducing cumulative runtime and minimizing the likelihood of
converging to local optima.

of directed graphs which express dependency relations, extracted from diverse
real-world sources such as package managers, version control systems, and event
graphs. Each graph contains anywhere from thousands to hundreds of millions of
nodes and edges, which are normalized into a simple, unified format. Both
cyclic and acyclic variants are included (as some graphs, such as citation
networks, are not entirely acyclic). The dataset is suitable for studying the
structure of different kinds of dependencies, enabling the characterization and
distinction of various dependency graph types. It has been utilized for
developing and testing efficient algorithms which leverage the specificities of

  scientific domains: the case of fractional citation counts",physics.soc-ph cs.DL,"  Citation numbers are extensively used for assessing the quality of scientific
research. The use of raw citation counts is generally misleading, especially
when applied to cross-disciplinary comparisons, since the average number of
citations received is strongly dependent on the scientific discipline of
reference of the paper. Measuring and eliminating biases in citation patterns
is crucial for a fair use of citation numbers. Several numerical indicators
have been introduced with this aim, but so far a specific statistical test for
estimating the fairness of these numerical indicators has not been developed.
Here we present a statistical method aimed at estimating the effectiveness of
numerical indicators in the suppression of citation biases. The method is
simple to implement and can be easily generalized to various scenarios. As a
practical example we test, in a controlled case, the fairness of fractional
citation count, which has been recently proposed as a tool for cross-discipline
comparison. We show that this indicator is not able to remove biases in
citation patterns and performs much worse than the rescaling of citation counts
with average values.

  freely available bibliographic data sources",cs.DL,"  As an important biomedical database, PubMed provides users with free access
to abstracts of its documents. However, citations between these documents need
to be collected from external data sources. Although previous studies have
investigated the coverage of various data sources, the quality of citations is
underexplored. In response, this study compares the coverage and citation
quality of five freely available data sources on 30 million PubMed documents,
including OpenCitations Index of CrossRef open DOI-to-DOI citations (COCI),
Dimensions, Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG), National Institutes of Health Open
Citation Collection (NIH-OCC), and Semantic Scholar Open Research Corpus
(S2ORC). Three gold standards and five metrics are introduced to evaluate the
correctness and completeness of citations. Our results indicate that Dimensions
is the most comprehensive data source that provides references for 62.4% of
PubMed documents, outperforming the official NIH-OCC dataset (56.7%). Over 90%
of citation links in other data sources can also be found in Dimensions. The
coverage of MAG, COCI, and S2ORC is 59.6%, 34.7%, and 23.5%, respectively.
Regarding the citation quality, Dimensions and NIH-OCC achieve the best overall
results. Almost all data sources have a precision higher than 90%, but their
recall is much lower. All databases have better performances on recent
publications than earlier ones. Meanwhile, the gaps between different data
sources have diminished for the documents published in recent years. This study
provides evidence for researchers to choose suitable PubMed citation sources,
which is also helpful for evaluating the citation quality of free bibliographic
databases.

  scientific impact",cs.DL physics.soc-ph,"  h-index has become the most popular indicator for quantifying a scientist's
scientific impact in various scientific fields. h-index is defined as the
largest number of papers with citation number larger than or equal to h and it
treats each citation equally. However, different citations usually come from
different papers with different influence and quality, and a citation from a
highly influential paper is a greater recognition of the target paper than a
citation from an ordinary paper. Based on this assumption, we proposed a new
indicator named x-index to quantify a scientist's scientific impact by
considering only the citations coming from influential papers. x-index is
defined as the largest number of papers with influential citation number larger
than or equal to x, where each influential citation comes from a paper for
which the average ACNPP (Average Citation Number Per Paper) of its authors
larger than or equal to x . Through analysis on the APS dataset, we find that
the proposed x-index has much better ability to discriminate between Physics
Prize Winners and ordinary physicists.

gnn_citations,graph neural networks for citation analysis,448,1810.11514,0.6843004,Learning and Interpreting Multi-Multi-Instance Learning Networks,cs.LG stat.ML,"  We introduce an extension of the multi-instance learning problem where
examples are organized as nested bags of instances (e.g., a document could be
represented as a bag of sentences, which in turn are bags of words). This
framework can be useful in various scenarios, such as text and image
classification, but also supervised learning over graphs. As a further
advantage, multi-multi instance learning enables a particular way of
interpreting predictions and the decision function. Our approach is based on a
special neural network layer, called bag-layer, whose units aggregate bags of
inputs of arbitrary size. We prove theoretically that the associated class of
functions contains all Boolean functions over sets of sets of instances and we
provide empirical evidence that functions of this kind can be actually learned
on semi-synthetic datasets. We finally present experiments on text
classification, on citation graphs, and social graph data, which show that our
model obtains competitive results with respect to accuracy when compared to
other approaches such as convolutional networks on graphs, while at the same
time it supports a general approach to interpret the learnt model, as well as
explain individual predictions.

  Top-m Attention Mechanism for Graph Representation Learning",cs.LG cs.AI,"  In the field of deep learning, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Graph
Transformer models, with their outstanding performance and flexible
architectural designs, have become leading technologies for processing
structured data, especially graph data. Traditional GNNs often face challenges
in capturing information from distant vertices effectively. In contrast, Graph
Transformer models are particularly adept at managing long-distance node
relationships. Despite these advantages, Graph Transformer models still
encounter issues with computational and storage efficiency when scaled to large
graph datasets. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative Graph
Neural Network (GNN) architecture that integrates a Top-m attention mechanism
aggregation component and a neighborhood aggregation component, effectively
enhancing the model's ability to aggregate relevant information from both local
and extended neighborhoods at each layer. This method not only improves
computational efficiency but also enriches the node features, facilitating a
deeper analysis of complex graph structures. Additionally, to assess the
effectiveness of our proposed model, we have applied it to citation sentiment
prediction, a novel task previously unexplored in the GNN field. Accordingly,
we constructed a dedicated citation network, ArXivNet. In this dataset, we
specifically annotated the sentiment polarity of the citations (positive,
neutral, negative) to enable in-depth sentiment analysis. Our approach has
shown superior performance across a variety of tasks including vertex
classification, link prediction, sentiment prediction, graph regression, and
visualization. It outperforms existing methods in terms of effectiveness, as
demonstrated by experimental results on multiple datasets.

environments, with one justification being that shared data may be re-used in
further research. But what evidence exists for such re-use, and what is the
relationship between the producers of shared datasets and researchers who use
them? Using a sample of data citations from OpenAlex, this study investigates
the relationship between creators and citers of datasets at the individual,
institutional, and national levels. We find that the vast majority of datasets
have no recorded citations, and that most cited datasets only have a single
citation. Rates of self-citation by individuals and institutions tend towards
the low end of previous findings and vary widely across disciplines. At the
country level, the United States is by far the most prominent exporter of
re-used datasets, while importation is more evenly distributed. Understanding
where and how the sharing of data between researchers, institutions, and
countries takes place is essential to developing open research practices.

  Analysis in Scholarly Publication",cs.CL cs.AI,"  Citation function and citation sentiment are two essential aspects of
citation content analysis (CCA), which are useful for influence analysis, the
recommendation of scientific publications. However, existing studies are mostly
traditional machine learning methods, although deep learning techniques have
also been explored, the improvement of the performance seems not significant
due to insufficient training data, which brings difficulties to applications.
In this paper, we propose to fine-tune pre-trained contextual embeddings
ULMFiT, BERT, and XLNet for the task. Experiments on three public datasets show
that our strategy outperforms all the baselines in terms of the F1 score. For
citation function identification, the XLNet model achieves 87.2%, 86.90%, and
81.6% on DFKI, UMICH, and TKDE2019 datasets respectively, while it achieves
91.72% and 91.56% on DFKI and UMICH in term of citation sentiment
identification. Our method can be used to enhance the influence analysis of

  Link Prediction",cs.LG cs.SI,"  Transparency and accountability have become major concerns for black-box
machine learning (ML) models. Proper explanations for the model behavior
increase model transparency and help researchers develop more accountable
models. Graph neural networks (GNN) have recently shown superior performance in
many graph ML problems than traditional methods, and explaining them has
attracted increased interest. However, GNN explanation for link prediction (LP)
is lacking in the literature. LP is an essential GNN task and corresponds to
web applications like recommendation and sponsored search on web. Given
existing GNN explanation methods only address node/graph-level tasks, we
propose Path-based GNN Explanation for heterogeneous Link prediction
(PaGE-Link) that generates explanations with connection interpretability,
enjoys model scalability, and handles graph heterogeneity. Qualitatively,
PaGE-Link can generate explanations as paths connecting a node pair, which
naturally captures connections between the two nodes and easily transfer to
human-interpretable explanations. Quantitatively, explanations generated by
PaGE-Link improve AUC for recommendation on citation and user-item graphs by 9
- 35% and are chosen as better by 78.79% of responses in human evaluation.

In this article, we propose an analysis of Crossref bibliographic references to show how we can use the unstructured text defining such references and the available (and partial) metadata specified in them to (a) map them to existing entities included in OpenCitations Meta and, then, (b) to enable the potential inclusion of additional and valid citations link among these entities. We have defined a precise methodology to address the analysis and run it against a manually defined Gold Standard and a subset of Crossref. While the heuristic-based tool developed has demonstrated strong matching precision and effective metadata integration, its recall limitations highlight the necessity of further enhancements to address metadata inconsistencies and leverage additional sources of citation data."

directed acyclic graphs where the probability of passing through a given node
is the key ingredient. We illustrate its use in evaluating the mutual influence
of nodes and discovering seminal papers in a citation network. We further
introduce a new similarity metric and test it in a simple personalized
recommendation process. This metric's performance is comparable to that of
classical similarity metrics, thus further supporting the validity of our
framework.

scientific research has been the analysis of the aggregated citation
information in a set of scientific publications. Although the representation of
this information as a citation network has already been coined in the 1960s, it
needed the systematic indexing of scientific literature to allow for impact
metrics that actually made use of this network as a whole improving on the then
prevailing metrics that were almost exclusively based on the number of direct
citations. However, besides focusing on the assignment of credit, the paper
citation network can also be studied in terms of the proliferation of
scientific ideas. Here we introduce a simple measure based on the
shortest-paths in the paper's in-component or, simply speaking, on the shape
and size of the wake of a paper within the citation network. Applied to a
citation network containing Physical Review publications from more than a
century, our approach is able to detect seminal articles which have introduced
concepts of obvious importance to the further development of physics. We
observe a large fraction of papers co-authored by Nobel Prize laureates in
physics among the top-ranked publications.

it. The sign of a network can be positive, negative, or neutral. A signed
network is ubiquitous in a real-world network like social networks, citation
networks, and various technical networks. There are many network embedding
models have been proposed and developed for signed networks for both
homogeneous and heterogeneous types. SG embedding learns low-dimensional vector
representations for nodes of a network, which helps to do many network analysis
tasks such as link prediction, node classification, and community detection. In
this survey, we perform a comprehensive study of SG embedding methods and
applications. We introduce here the basic theories and methods of SGs and
survey the current state of the art of signed graph embedding methods. In
addition, we explore the applications of different types of SG embedding
methods in real-world scenarios. As an application, we have explored the
citation network to analyze authorship networks. We also provide source code
and datasets to give future direction. Lastly, we explore the challenges of SG
embedding and forecast various future research directions in this field.

of our times. Based on mining several million citations, we quantitatively
analyze the processes driving paradigm shifts in science. We find that
groundbreaking discoveries of Nobel Prize Laureates and other famous scientists
are not only acknowledged by many citations of their landmark papers.
Surprisingly, they also boost the citation rates of their previous
publications. Given that innovations must outcompete the rich-gets-richer
effect for scientific citations, it turns out that they can make their way only
through citation cascades. A quantitative analysis reveals how and why they
happen. Science appears to behave like a self-organized critical system, in
which citation cascades of all sizes occur, from continuous scientific progress
all the way up to scientific revolutions, which change the way we see our
world. Measuring the ""boosting effect"" of landmark papers, our analysis reveals
how new ideas and new players can make their way and finally triumph in a world
dominated by established paradigms. The underlying ""boost factor"" is also
useful to discover scientific breakthroughs and talents much earlier than
through classical citation analysis, which by now has become a widespread
method to measure scientific excellence, influencing scientific careers and the
distribution of research funds. Our findings reveal patterns of collective
social behavior, which are also interesting from an attention economics
perspective. Understanding the origin of scientific authority may therefore
ultimately help to explain, how social influence comes about and why the value
of goods depends so strongly on the attention they attract.

resources for analyzing and understanding the intellectual influence of
scientific publications. In the field of statistics, current studies of
citation data have mostly focused on the interactions between statistical
journals and papers, limiting the measure of influence to mainly within
statistics itself. In this paper, we take the first step towards understanding
the impact statistics has made on other scientific fields in the era of Big
Data. By collecting comprehensive bibliometric data from the Web of Science
database for selected statistical journals, we investigate the citation trends
and compositions of citing fields over time to show that their diversity has
been increasing. Furthermore, we use the local clustering technique involving
personalized PageRank with conductance for size selection to find the most
relevant statistical research area for a given external topic of interest. We
provide theoretical guarantees for the procedure and, through a number of case
studies, show the results from our citation data align well with our knowledge
and intuition about these external topics. Overall, we have found that the
statistical theory and methods recently invented by the statistics community
have made increasing impact on other scientific fields.

enabling data-driven representation learning in a decade. Because science and
technology policy decisions for a nation can be made on the impact of each
technology, quantifying research impact is an important task. The number of
citations and impact factor can be used to measure the impact for individual
research. What would have happened without the research, however, is
fundamentally a counterfactual phenomenon. Thus, we propose an approach based
on causal inference to quantify the research impact of a specific technical
topic. We leverage difference-in-difference to quantify the research impact by
applying to bibliometric data. First, we identify papers of a specific
technical topic using keywords or category tags from Microsoft Academic Graph,
which is one of the largest academic publication dataset. Next, we build a
paper citation network between each technical field. Then, we aggregate the
cross-field citation count for each research field. Finally, the impact of a
specific technical topic for each research field is estimated by applying
difference-in-difference. Evaluation results show that deep learning
significantly affects computer vision and natural language processing. Besides,
deep learning significantly affects cross-field citation especially for speech
recognition to computer vision and natural language processing to computer
vision. Moreover, our method revealed that the impact of deep learning was 3.1
times of the impact of interpretability for ML models.

However, the underlying mechanism driving individual citation behavior remains
imperfectly understood, despite the recent proliferation of quantitative
research methods. Traditional network models normally use graph theory to
consider articles as nodes and citations as pairwise relationships between
them. In this paper, we propose an alternative evolutionary model based on
hypergraph theory in which one hyperedge can have an arbitrary number of nodes,
combined with an aging effect to reflect the temporal dynamics of scientific
citation behavior. Both theoretical approximate solution and simulation
analysis of the model are developed and validated using two benchmark datasets
from different disciplines, i.e. publications of the American Physical Society
(APS) and the Digital Bibliography & Library Project (DBLP). Further analysis
indicates that the attraction of early publications will decay exponentially.
Moreover, the experimental results show that the aging effect indeed has a
significant influence on the description of collective citation patterns.
Shedding light on the complex dynamics driving these mechanisms facilitates the
understanding of the laws governing scientific evolution and the quantitative
evaluation of scientific outputs.

Aiming to better understand evergreens in particular and patterns of citation
trajectory in general, this paper develops a functional data analysis method to
cluster citation trajectories of a sample of 1699 research papers published in
1980 in the American Physical Society (APS) journals. We propose a functional
Poisson regression model for individual papers' citation trajectories, and fit
the model to the observed 30-year citations of individual papers by functional
principal component analysis and maximum likelihood estimation. Based on the
estimated paper-specific coefficients, we apply the K-means clustering
algorithm to cluster papers into different groups, for uncovering general types
of citation trajectories. The result demonstrates the existence of an evergreen

provides a free and open alternative to obtaining citations of papers available
on the net, (though it is not clear exactly which journals are covered.)
Citations are collected automatically from the net and also added to self

These assessments commonly classify Japan as a developing country, which contradicts its prominent scientific standing. The purpose of this study is to investigate the underlying causes of such inaccurate assessments and to propose methods for conducting more reliable evaluations. Design/methodology/approach: The study evaluates the effectiveness of top-percentile citation metrics as indicators of breakthrough research. Using case studies of selected countries and research topics, the study examines how deviations from lognormal citation distributions impact the accuracy of these percentile indicators. A similar analysis is conducted using university data from the Leiden Ranking to investigate citation distribution deviations at the institutional level. Findings: The study finds that inflated lower tails in citation distributions lead to undervaluation of research capabilities in advanced technological countries, as captured by some percentile indicators. Conversely, research-intensive universities exhibit the opposite trend: a reduced lower tail relative to the upper tail, which causes percentile indicators to overestimate their actual research capacity. Research limitations: The descriptions are mathematical facts that are self-evident. Practical implications: Due to variations in citation patterns across countries and institutions, the Ptop 10%/P and Ptop 1%/P ratios are not universal predictors of breakthrough research. Evaluations should move away from these metrics. Relying on inappropriate citation-based measures could lead to poor decision-making in research policy, undermining the effectiveness of research strategies and their outcomes."

scientific documents, demanding an in-depth comprehension of the cited paper.
Constructing citations is often time-consuming, requiring researchers to delve
into extensive literature and grapple with articulating relevant content. To
address this challenge, the field of citation text generation (CTG) has
emerged. However, while earlier methods have primarily centered on creating
single-sentence citations, practical scenarios frequently necessitate citing
multiple papers within a single paragraph. To bridge this gap, we propose a
method that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate multi-citation
sentences. Our approach involves a single source paper and a collection of
target papers, culminating in a coherent paragraph containing multi-sentence
citation text. Furthermore, we introduce a curated dataset named MCG-S2ORC,
composed of English-language academic research papers in Computer Science,
showcasing multiple citation instances. In our experiments, we evaluate three
LLMs LLaMA, Alpaca, and Vicuna to ascertain the most effective model for this
endeavor. Additionally, we exhibit enhanced performance by integrating
knowledge graphs from target papers into the prompts for generating citation
text. This research underscores the potential of harnessing LLMs for citation
generation, opening a compelling avenue for exploring the intricate connections
between scientific documents.

of a more abstract indicator scheme that can be used to organize and/or
schematize different impact indicators according to three degrees of freedom:
the selection of the reference sets, the evaluation criteria, and the choice of
whether or not to define the publication sets as independent. Bibliometric data
of seven principal investigators (PIs) of the Academic Medical Center of the
University of Amsterdam is used as an exemplary data set. We demonstrate that
the proposed indicators [R(6), R(100), R(6,k), R(100,k)] are an improvement of
averages-based indicators because one can account for the shape of the
distributions of citations over papers.

and extraction of valuable insights. While existing scientific search engines
excel at delivering search results based on relational databases, they often
neglect the analysis of collaborations between scientific entities and the
evolution of ideas, as well as the in-depth analysis of content within
scientific publications. The representation of heterogeneous graphs and the
effective measurement, analysis, and mining of such graphs pose significant
challenges. To address these challenges, we present AceMap, an academic system
designed for knowledge discovery through academic graph. We present advanced
database construction techniques to build the comprehensive AceMap database
with large-scale academic entities that contain rich visual, textual, and
numerical information. AceMap also employs innovative visualization,
quantification, and analysis methods to explore associations and logical
relationships among academic entities. AceMap introduces large-scale academic
network visualization techniques centered on nebular graphs, providing a
comprehensive view of academic networks from multiple perspectives. In
addition, AceMap proposes a unified metric based on structural entropy to
quantitatively measure the knowledge content of different academic entities.
Moreover, AceMap provides advanced analysis capabilities, including tracing the
evolution of academic ideas through citation relationships and concept
co-occurrence, and generating concise summaries informed by this evolutionary
process. In addition, AceMap uses machine reading methods to generate potential

  for mathematics articles?",cs.DL cs.IR math.HO,"  An analysis of 2,765 articles published in four math journals from 1997 to
2005 indicate that articles deposited in the arXiv received 35% more citations
on average than non-deposited articles (an advantage of about 1.1 citations per
article), and that this difference was most pronounced for highly-cited
articles. Open Access, Early View, and Quality Differential were examined as
three non-exclusive postulates for explaining the citation advantage. There was
little support for a universal Open Access explanation, and no empirical
support for Early View. There was some inferential support for a Quality
Differential brought about by more highly-citable articles being deposited in
the arXiv. In spite of their citation advantage, arXiv-deposited articles
received 23% fewer downloads from the publisher's website (about 10 fewer
downloads per article) in all but the most recent two years after publication.
The data suggest that arXiv and the publisher's website may be fulfilling
distinct functional needs of the reader.

when counting citations may therefore give finer-grained citation count
information. Although identifying and aggregating the individual reasons for
each citation may be impractical, recording the number of citations that
originate from different article sections might illuminate the general reasons
behind a citation count (e.g., 110 citations = 10 Introduction citations + 100
Methods citations). To help investigate whether this could be a practical and
universal solution, this article compares 19 million citations with DOIs from
six different standard sections in 799,055 PubMed Central open access articles
across 21 out of 22 fields. There are apparently non-systematic differences
between fields in the most citing sections and the extent to which citations
from one section overlap with citations from another, with some degree of
overlap in most cases. Thus, at a science-wide level, section headings are
partly unreliable indicators of citation context, even if they are more
standard within individual fields. They may still be used within fields to help
identify individual highly cited articles that have had one type of impact,
especially methodological (Methods) or context setting (Introduction), but
expert judgement is needed to validate the results.

resounding success of deep learning in various applications, has brought the
interest in generalizing deep learning models to non-Euclidean domains. In this
paper, we introduce a new spectral domain convolutional architecture for deep
learning on graphs. The core ingredient of our model is a new class of
parametric rational complex functions (Cayley polynomials) allowing to
efficiently compute spectral filters on graphs that specialize on frequency
bands of interest. Our model generates rich spectral filters that are localized
in space, scales linearly with the size of the input data for
sparsely-connected graphs, and can handle different constructions of Laplacian
operators. Extensive experimental results show the superior performance of our
approach, in comparison to other spectral domain convolutional architectures,
on spectral image classification, community detection, vertex classification
and matrix completion tasks.

adverse consequences not just on the disadvantaged genders, but also on the

addressing them. In this work, we examine female first author percentages and
the citations to their papers in Natural Language Processing (1965 to 2019). We
determine aggregate-level statistics using an existing manually curated
author--gender list as well as first names strongly associated with a gender.
We find that only about 29% of first authors are female and only about 25% of
last authors are female. Notably, this percentage has not improved since the
mid 2000s. We also show that, on average, female first authors are cited less
than male first authors, even when controlling for experience and area of

is a complex problem in document processing and is an active area of research.
The recent success of deep learning in solving various computer vision and
machine learning problems has not been reflected in document structure analysis
since conventional neural networks are not well suited to the input structure
of the problem. In this paper, we propose an architecture based on graph
networks as a better alternative to standard neural networks for table
recognition. We argue that graph networks are a more natural choice for these
problems, and explore two gradient-based graph neural networks. Our proposed
architecture combines the benefits of convolutional neural networks for visual
feature extraction and graph networks for dealing with the problem structure.
We empirically demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline by a
significant margin. In addition, we identify the lack of large scale datasets
as a major hindrance for deep learning research for structure analysis and
present a new large scale synthetic dataset for the problem of table
recognition. Finally, we open-source our implementation of dataset generation
and the training framework of our graph networks to promote reproducible

of separation in a co-author network, essentially using collaboration networks
to expand on the notion of self-citations. While the proportion of direct
self-citations (including co-authors of both citing and cited papers) is
relatively constant in time and across specialties in the natural sciences (10%
of citations) and the social sciences (20%), the same cannot be said for
citations to authors who are members of the co-author network. Differences
between fields and trends over time lie not only in the degree of co-authorship
which defines the large-scale topology of the collaboration network, but also
in the referencing practices within a given discipline, computed by defining a
propensity to cite at a given distance within the collaboration network.
Overall, there is little tendency to cite those nearby in the collaboration
network, excluding direct self-citations. By analyzing these social references,
we characterize the social capital of local collaboration networks in terms of
the knowledge production within scientific fields. These results have
implications for the long-standing debate over biases common to most types of
citation analysis, and for understanding citation practices across scientific
disciplines over the past 50 years. In addition, our findings have important
practical implications for the availability of 'arm's length' expert reviewers

  metric",cs.DL physics.soc-ph,"  In this paper we present ""citation success index"", a metric for comparing the
citation capacity of pairs of journals. Citation success index is the
probability that a random paper in one journal has more citations than a random
paper in another journal (50% means the two journals do equally well). Unlike
the journal impact factor (IF), the citation success index depends on the
broadness and the shape of citation distributions. Also, it is insensitive to
sporadic highly-cited papers that skew the IF. Nevertheless, we show, based on
16,000 journals containing ~2.4 million articles, that the citation success
index is a relatively tight function of the ratio of IFs of journals being
compared, due to the fact that journals with same IF have quite similar
citation distributions. The citation success index grows slowly as a function
of IF ratio. It is substantial (>90%) only when the ratio of IFs exceeds ~6,
whereas a factor of two difference in IF values translates into a modest
advantage for the journal with higher IF (index of ~70%). We facilitate the
wider adoption of this metric by providing an online calculator that takes as
input parameters only the IFs of the pair of journals.

the characteristics of three different kinds of citations, this paper borrows
musical vocabulary and names them solo citations (SC), duet citations (DC), and
prelude citations (PC) respectively. Studying how to measure the disruption of
a published work effectively, this study analyzes nine indicators and suggests
a general evaluation formula. Seven of the nine indicators are innovations
introduced by this paper: SC, SC-DC, SC-PC, SC-DC-PC, (SC-DC)/(SC+DC),
(SC-PC)/(SC+DC), and (SC-DC-PC)/(SC+DC), as is the general formula. These
indices are discussed considering two cases: One case concerns the Citation
Indexes for Science and the other concerns Co-citations. The results show that,
compared with other indicators, four indicators (SC, SC-DC, SC/(SC+DC), and
(SC-DC)/(SC+DC)) are logically and empirically reasonable. Future research may
consider combining these indices, for example, using SC multiplied by
SC/(SC+DC) or SC-DC multiplied by (SC-DC)/(SC+DC), to get final evaluation
results that contain desirable characteristics of two types of indicators.
Confirming which of the evaluation results from these indicators can best

both network covariates, such as graph embedding coordinates or local subgraph

While standard regression methods that make use of both types of covariates may
be used for prediction, statistical inference is complicated by the fact that
the nodal summary statistics are often dependent in complex ways. We show that
under a mild joint exchangeability assumption, a network analog of conformal

achievable. The methods are illustrated on both simulated networks and a

CoVariance Neural Networks (VNN) address this issue by using the sample covariance matrix as a Graph Shift Operator (GSO). Here, we improve on the performance of VNNs by constructing a Density Matrix where we consider the sample Covariance matrix as a quasi-Hamiltonian of the system in the space of random variables. Crucially, using this density matrix as the GSO allows components of the data to be extracted at different scales, allowing enhanced discriminability and performance. We show that this approach allows explicit control of the stability-discriminability trade-off of the network, provides enhanced robustness to noise compared to VNNs, and outperforms them in useful real-life applications where the underlying covariance matrix is informative. In particular, we show that our model can achieve strong performance in subject-independent Brain Computer Interface EEG motor imagery classification, outperforming EEGnet while being faster. This shows how covariance density neural networks provide a basis for the notoriously difficult task of transferability of BCIs when evaluated on unseen individuals."

This issue is particularly pressing in light of the recent growing interest in designing graph foundation models. These models are supposed to be able to transfer to diverse graph datasets from different domains, and yet the proposed graph foundation models are often evaluated on a very limited set of datasets from narrow applications. To alleviate this issue, we introduce GraphLand: a benchmark of 14 diverse graph datasets for node property prediction from a range of different industrial applications. GraphLand allows evaluating graph ML models on a wide range of graphs with diverse sizes, structural characteristics, and feature sets, all in a unified setting. Further, GraphLand allows investigating such previously underexplored research questions as how realistic temporal distributional shifts under transductive and inductive settings influence graph ML model performance. To mimic realistic industrial settings, we use GraphLand to compare GNNs with gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDT) models that are popular in industrial applications and show that GBDTs provided with additional graph-based input features can sometimes be very strong baselines. Further, we evaluate currently available general-purpose graph foundation models and find that they fail to produce competitive results on our proposed datasets."

GNNs are not inherently interpretable and thus, many explanation methods have been proposed. However, existing explanation methods often struggle to generate interpretable, fine-grained rationales, especially when node attributes include rich natural language. In this work, we introduce LOGIC, a lightweight, post-hoc framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to generate faithful and interpretable explanations for GNN predictions. LOGIC projects GNN node embeddings into the LLM embedding space and constructs hybrid prompts that interleave soft prompts with textual inputs from the graph structure. This enables the LLM to reason about GNN internal representations and produce natural language explanations along with concise explanation subgraphs. Our experiments across four real-world TAG datasets demonstrate that LOGIC achieves a favorable trade-off between fidelity and sparsity, while significantly improving human-centric metrics such as insightfulness.

However, mainstream approaches generally rely on a large number of trainable parameters and fixed aggregation rules, making it difficult to adapt to graph data with strong structural heterogeneity and complex feature distributions. This often leads to over-smoothing of node representations and semantic degradation. To address these issues, this paper proposes a parameter-free graph neural network framework based on structural diversity, namely SDGNN (Structural-Diversity Graph Neural Network). The framework is inspired by structural diversity theory and designs a unified structural-diversity message passing mechanism that simultaneously captures the heterogeneity of neighborhood structures and the stability of feature semantics, without introducing additional trainable parameters. Unlike traditional parameterized methods, SDGNN does not rely on complex model training, but instead leverages complementary modeling from both structure-driven and feature-driven perspectives, thereby effectively improving adaptability across datasets and scenarios. Experimental results show that on eight public benchmark datasets and an interdisciplinary PubMed citation network, SDGNN consistently outperforms mainstream GNNs under challenging conditions such as low supervision, class imbalance, and cross-domain transfer. This work provides a new theoretical perspective and general approach for the design of parameter-free graph neural networks, and further validates the importance of structural diversity as a core signal in graph representation learning.

is that it has had such a disproportionately larger impact than Kuhn's other
concepts, e.g., ""scientific revolution"". The paradigm concept accounts for over
80% of the concept-related citations to Kuhn's work, and its impact is
resilient across all disciplines and over time. With respect to Popper,
""falsification"" is the most used concept derived from his books. Falsification,
after all, is the cornerstone of Popper's critical rationalism.

  Algebraic Analysis",cs.LG cs.AI eess.SP stat.ML,"  Despite the remarkable success of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), the common
belief is that their representation power is limited and that they are at most
as expressive as the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) algorithm. In this paper, we argue
the opposite and show that standard GNNs, with anonymous inputs, produce more
discriminative representations than the WL algorithm. Our novel analysis
employs linear algebraic tools and characterizes the representation power of
GNNs with respect to the eigenvalue decomposition of the graph operators. We
prove that GNNs are able to generate distinctive outputs from white
uninformative inputs, for, at least, all graphs that have different
eigenvalues. We also show that simple convolutional architectures with white
inputs, produce equivariant features that count the closed paths in the graph
and are provably more expressive than the WL representations. Thorough
experimental analysis on graph isomorphism and graph classification datasets
corroborates our theoretical results and demonstrates the effectiveness of the
proposed approach.

STEM fields (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) suffer from
gender biases. In this paper, we study the physics community, a core STEM field
in which women are still largely underrepresented and where these gender
disparities persist. To reveal such inequalities, we compare the citations
received by papers led by men and women that cover the same topics in a
comparable way. To do that, we devise a robust statistical measure of
similarity between publications that enables us to detect pairs of similar
papers. Our findings indicate that although papers written by women tend to
have lower visibility in the citation network, pairs of similar papers written
by men and women receive comparable attention when corrected for the time of
publication. These analyses suggest that gender disparity is closely related to
the first-mover and cumulative advantage that men have in physics, and is not
an intentional act of discrimination towards women.

areas. For example, event-related potential (ERP) signal classification is a
highly complex task potentially suitable for DNN as signal-to-noise ratio is
low, and underlying spatial and temporal patterns display a large intra- and
intersubject variability. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been
compared with baseline traditional models, i.e. linear discriminant analysis
(LDA) and support vector machines (SVM) for single trial classification using a
large multi-subject publicly available P300 dataset of school-age children (138
males and 112 females). For single trial classification, classification
accuracy stayed between 62% and 64% for all tested classification models. When
applying the trained classification models to averaged trials, accuracy
increased to 76-79% without significant differences among classification
models. CNN did not prove superior to baseline for the tested dataset.
Comparison with related literature, limitations and future directions are

  Approach",cs.DL,"  In contrast to many other scientific disciplines, computer science considers
conference publications. Conferences have the advantage of providing fast
publication of papers and of bringing researchers together to present and
discuss the paper with peers. Previous work on knowledge mapping focused on the
map of all sciences or a particular domain based on ISI published JCR (Journal
Citation Report). Although this data covers most of important journals, it
lacks computer science conference and workshop proceedings. That results in an
imprecise and incomplete analysis of the computer science knowledge. This paper
presents an analysis on the computer science knowledge network constructed from
all types of publications, aiming at providing a complete view of computer
science research. Based on the combination of two important digital libraries
(DBLP and CiteSeerX), we study the knowledge network created at
journal/conference level using citation linkage, to identify the development of
sub-disciplines. We investigate the collaborative and citation behavior of
journals/conferences by analyzing the properties of their co-authorship and
citation subgraphs. The paper draws several important conclusions. First,
conferences constitute social structures that shape the computer science
knowledge. Second, computer science is becoming more interdisciplinary. Third,
experts are the key success factor for sustainability of journals/conferences.

state-of-the-art neural network models designed for graph learning, e.g. graph
convolutional networks (GCN) and graph attention networks (GAT), adequately
utilize edge features, especially multi-dimensional edge features. In this
paper, we build a new framework for a family of new graph neural network models
that can more sufficiently exploit edge features, including those of undirected
or multi-dimensional edges. The proposed framework can consolidate current
graph neural network models; e.g. graph convolutional networks (GCN) and graph
attention networks (GAT). The proposed framework and new models have the
following novelties: First, we propose to use doubly stochastic normalization
of graph edge features instead of the commonly used row or symmetric
normalization approches used in current graph neural networks. Second, we
construct new formulas for the operations in each individual layer so that they
can handle multi-dimensional edge features. Third, for the proposed new
framework, edge features are adaptive across network layers. As a result, our
proposed new framework and new models can exploit a rich source of graph
information. We apply our new models to graph node classification on several
citation networks, whole graph classification, and regression on several
molecular datasets. Compared with the current state-of-the-art methods, i.e.
GCNs and GAT, our models obtain better performance, which testify to the
importance of exploiting edge features in graph neural networks.

real-world applications such as social networks, biological data and citation
networks. In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved
tremendous success in various domains, which makes applying LLMs to graphs
particularly appealing. However, directly applying LLMs to graph modalities
presents unique challenges due to the discrepancy and mismatch between the
graph and text modalities. Hence, to further investigate LLMs' potential for
comprehending graph information, we introduce GraphPrompter, a novel framework
designed to align graph information with LLMs via soft prompts. Specifically,
GraphPrompter consists of two main components: a graph neural network to encode
complex graph information and an LLM that effectively processes textual
information. Comprehensive experiments on various benchmark datasets under node
classification and link prediction tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed method. The GraphPrompter framework unveils the substantial
capabilities of LLMs as predictors in graph-related tasks, enabling researchers
to utilize LLMs across a spectrum of real-world graph scenarios more
effectively.

methods in many domains. Recently these methods have gained attention in
neuroscience and particularly in brain-computer interface (BCI) community.
Here, we introduce a CNN optimized for classification of brain states from
magnetoencephalographic (MEG) measurements. Our CNN design is based on a
generative model of the electromagnetic (EEG and MEG) brain signals and is
readily interpretable in neurophysiological terms. We show here that the
proposed network is able to decode event-related responses as well as
modulations of oscillatory brain activity and that it outperforms more complex
neural networks and traditional classifiers used in the field. Importantly, the
model is robust to inter-individual differences and can successfully generalize
to new subjects in offline and online classification.

deposited in the Condensed Matter section of the preprint server ArXiv (hosted
by Cornell University), and subsequently published in a scientific journal,
compares to that of articles in the same journal that were not deposited in
that archive. Its principal aim is to further illustrate and roughly estimate
the effect of two factors, 'early view' and 'quality bias', upon differences in
citation impact between these two sets of papers, using citation data from
Thomson Scientific's Web of Science. It presents estimates for a number of
journals in the field of condensed matter physics. In order to discriminate
between an 'open access' effect and an early view effect, longitudinal citation
data was analysed covering a time period as long as 7 years. Quality bias was
measured by calculating ArXiv citation impact differentials at the level of
individual authors publishing in a journal, taking into account co-authorship.
The analysis provided evidence of a strong quality bias and early view effect.
Correcting for these effects, there is in a sample of 6 condensed matter
physics journals studied in detail, no sign of a general 'open access
advantage' of papers deposited in ArXiv. The study does provide evidence that
ArXiv accelerates citation, due to the fact that that ArXiv makes papers
earlier available rather than that it makes papers freely available.

whereas the effects of government funding are negative, an order of magnitude
smaller, and statistically non-significant (in two of three analyses). In other
words, international collaboration improves the impact of average research

However, this process is often time-consuming for researchers. In this study, we propose the SciRGC framework, which aims to automatically recommend citation articles and generate citation sentences for citation locations within articles. The framework addresses two key challenges in academic citation generation: 1) how to accurately identify the author's citation intent and find relevant citation papers, and 2) how to generate high-quality citation sentences that align with human preferences. We enhance citation recommendation accuracy in the citation article recommendation module by incorporating citation networks and sentiment intent, and generate reasoning-based citation sentences in the citation sentence generation module by using the original article abstract, local context, citation intent, and recommended articles as inputs. Additionally, we propose a new evaluation metric to fairly assess the quality of generated citation sentences. Through comparisons with baseline models and ablation experiments, the SciRGC framework not only improves the accuracy and relevance of citation recommendations but also ensures the appropriateness of the generated citation sentences in context, providing a valuable tool for interdisciplinary researchers."

Longitudinal analysis over established journal category schemes is used to

well self-reported funding outcomes collected by UK funders corresponds to data
indexed in the Overton database, and if peer-review assessment of impact as
measured by the UK Research Excellence Framework (REF) 2014 correlates with
derived citation metrics. Our findings show that for some research topics, such
as health, economics, social care and the environment, Overton contains a core
set of policy documents with sufficient citation linkage to academic literature
to support various citation analysis that may be informative in research
evaluation, impact assessment, and policy review. The data indexed in Overton
agrees with that collected via self-reporting of funding outcomes, and
correlates with peer-review assessment of impact in some disciplines.

of SN/FB. The law has come a long way, from obscurity to now being a regular
subject of books, peer reviewed papers, patents, blogs and news. Here, we use
Google Scholar (GS) to collect the data on the number of citations received by
the articles citing the original paper of SN/FB and then investigate whether
the leading digits of this citations data are distributed according to the law
they discovered. We find that the citations data of literature on BL is in
remarkable agreement with the predictions of the law.

formalize principles underlying stages in the life-cycle of scientific

we model the state of scientific knowledge immediately preceding new directions
of research as a metastable state and the creation of new concepts as
combinatorial innovation. We find that, through the combined use of natural
language clustering and citation graph analysis, we can predict the evolution
of ideas over time and thus connect a single scientific article to past and
future concepts in a way that goes beyond traditional citation and reference
connections.

  Extending ACA to the Web Environment",cs.IR cs.DL physics.soc-ph,"  Co-occurrence matrices, such as co-citation, co-word, and co-link matrices,
have been used widely in the information sciences. However, confusion and
controversy have hindered the proper statistical analysis of this data. The
underlying problem, in our opinion, involved understanding the nature of
various types of matrices. This paper discusses the difference between a
symmetrical co-citation matrix and an asymmetrical citation matrix as well as
the appropriate statistical techniques that can be applied to each of these
matrices, respectively. Similarity measures (like the Pearson correlation
coefficient or the cosine) should not be applied to the symmetrical co-citation
matrix, but can be applied to the asymmetrical citation matrix to derive the
proximity matrix. The argument is illustrated with examples. The study then
extends the application of co-occurrence matrices to the Web environment where
the nature of the available data and thus data collection methods are different
from those of traditional databases such as the Science Citation Index. A set
of data collected with the Google Scholar search engine is analyzed using both
the traditional methods of multivariate analysis and the new visualization

text representations for various tasks such as text classification, due to its
expressive power in modeling graph structure data (e.g., a literature citation
network). Most existing GCNs are limited to deal with documents included in a
pre-defined graph, i.e., it cannot be generalized to out-of-graph documents. To
address this issue, we propose to transform the document graph into a word
graph, to decouple data samples (i.e., documents in training and test sets) and
a GCN model by using a document-independent graph. Such word-level GCN could
therefore naturally inference out-of-graph documents in an inductive way. The
proposed Word-level Graph (WGraph) can not only implicitly learning word
presentation with commonly-used word co-occurrences in corpora, but also
incorporate extra global semantic dependency derived from inter-document
relationships (e.g., literature citations). An inductive Word-grounded Graph
Convolutional Network (WGCN) is proposed to learn word and document
representations based on WGraph in a supervised manner. Experiments on text
classification with and without citation networks evidence that the proposed
WGCN model outperforms existing methods in terms of effectiveness and
efficiency.

Web of Science Clarivate Analytics database and those published in the main
journals in the field (70,000+ publications), created by searching for the key

statements in Wikipedia pages, where statements can be arbitrary pieces of
text, ranging from a sentence to a paragraph. In many cases citations are
either outdated or missing altogether.
  In this work we address the problem of finding and updating news citations
for statements in entity pages. We propose a two-stage supervised approach for
this problem. In the first step, we construct a classifier to find out whether
statements need a news citation or other kinds of citations (web, book,
journal, etc.). In the second step, we develop a news citation algorithm for
Wikipedia statements, which recommends appropriate citations from a given news
collection. Apart from IR techniques that use the statement to query the news
collection, we also formalize three properties of an appropriate citation,
namely: (i) the citation should entail the Wikipedia statement, (ii) the
statement should be central to the citation, and (iii) the citation should be
from an authoritative source.
  We perform an extensive evaluation of both steps, using 20 million articles
from a real-world news collection. Our results are quite promising, and show
that we can perform this task with high precision and at scale.

informed quality assessments of both publications and careers of scientists in
the absence of complete systemic information. However, the relation between
reputation and career growth of an individual remains poorly understood,
despite recent proliferation of quantitative research evaluation methods. Here
we develop an original framework for measuring how a publication's citation
rate $\Delta c$ depends on the reputation of its central author $i$, in
addition to its net citation count $c$. To estimate the strength of the
reputation effect, we perform a longitudinal analysis on the careers of 450
highly-cited scientists, using the total citations $C_{i}$ of each scientist as
his/her reputation measure. We find a citation crossover $c_{\times}$ which
distinguishes the strength of the reputation effect. For publications with $c <
c_{\times}$, the author's reputation is found to dominate the annual citation
rate. Hence, a new publication may gain a significant early advantage
corresponding to roughly a 66% increase in the citation rate for each tenfold
increase in $C_{i}$. However, the reputation effect becomes negligible for
highly cited publications meaning that for $c\geq c_{\times}$ the citation rate
measures scientific impact more transparently. In addition we have developed a
stochastic reputation model, which is found to reproduce numerous statistical
observations for real careers, thus providing insight into the microscopic
mechanisms underlying cumulative advantage in science.

  Evaluation",cs.IR cs.CL,"  Large language models (LLMs) often generate content with unsupported or
unverifiable content, known as ""hallucinations."" To address this,
retrieval-augmented LLMs are employed to include citations in their content,
grounding the content in verifiable sources. Despite such developments,
manually assessing how well a citation supports the associated statement
remains a major challenge. Previous studies tackle this challenge by leveraging
faithfulness metrics to estimate citation support automatically. However, they
limit this citation support estimation to a binary classification scenario,
neglecting fine-grained citation support in practical scenarios. To investigate
the effectiveness of faithfulness metrics in fine-grained scenarios, we propose
a comparative evaluation framework that assesses the metric effectiveness in
distinguishing citations between three-category support levels: full, partial,
and no support. Our framework employs correlation analysis, classification
evaluation, and retrieval evaluation to measure the alignment between metric
scores and human judgments comprehensively. Our results indicate no single
metric consistently excels across all evaluations, highlighting the complexity
of accurately evaluating fine-grained support levels. Particularly, we find
that the best-performing metrics struggle to distinguish partial support from
full or no support. Based on these findings, we provide practical
recommendations for developing more effective metrics.

conclusions are not entirely consistent among fields, and two possible
explications have been suggested in those fields where a citation advantage has
been observed for OA: the early view and the selection bias postulates. In this
study, a longitudinal and multidisciplinary analysis of the gold OA citation
advantage is developed. All research articles in all journals for all subject
categories in the multidisciplinary database Web of Science are considered. A
total of 1,137,634 articles - 86,712 OA articles (7.6%) and 1,050,922 non-OA

of journal impact factors for OA and non-OA journals in those disciplines whose
OA prevalence is higher (top 36 subject categories). As the main conclusion,
there is no generalizable gold OA citation advantage, neither at article nor at

gnn_citations,graph neural networks for citation analysis,521,1110.2153,0.6753449,Characterizing and modeling citation dynamics,physics.soc-ph cs.DL cs.SI physics.data-an,"  Citation distributions are crucial for the analysis and modeling of the
activity of scientists. We investigated bibliometric data of papers published
in journals of the American Physical Society, searching for the type of
function which best describes the observed citation distributions. We used the
goodness of fit with Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics for three classes of
functions: log-normal, simple power law and shifted power law. The shifted
power law turns out to be the most reliable hypothesis for all citation
networks we derived, which correspond to different time spans. We find that
citation dynamics is characterized by bursts, usually occurring within a few
years since publication of a paper, and the burst size spans several orders of
magnitude. We also investigated the microscopic mechanisms for the evolution of
citation networks, by proposing a linear preferential attachment with time
dependent initial attractiveness. The model successfully reproduces the
empirical citation distributions and accounts for the presence of citation
bursts as well.

interconnected systems such as transportation networks, integrated circuits,
power grids, citation graphs, and biological and artificial neural networks.
Graph clustering algorithms can be used to detect groups of strongly connected
vertices and to derive coarse-grained models. We define transfer operators such
as the Koopman operator and the Perron-Frobenius operator on graphs, study
their spectral properties, introduce Galerkin projections of these operators,
and illustrate how reduced representations can be estimated from data. In
particular, we show that spectral clustering of undirected graphs can be
interpreted in terms of eigenfunctions of the Koopman operator and propose
novel clustering algorithms for directed graphs based on generalized transfer
operators. We demonstrate the efficacy of the resulting algorithms on several
benchmark problems and provide different interpretations of clusters.

This serialization hinders the model's ability to leverage structural inductive biases, especially in tasks such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and reasoning on data with native graph structures, where inter-segment dependencies are crucial. We introduce Graph-KV with the potential to overcome this limitation. Graph-KV leverages the KV-cache of text segments as condensed representations and governs their interaction through structural inductive biases. In this framework, 'target' segments selectively attend only to the KV-caches of their designated 'source' segments, rather than all preceding segments in a serialized sequence. This approach induces a graph-structured block mask, sparsifying attention and enabling a message-passing-like step within the LLM. Furthermore, strategically allocated positional encodings for source and target segments reduce positional bias and context window consumption. We evaluate Graph-KV across three scenarios: (1) seven RAG benchmarks spanning direct inference, multi-hop reasoning, and long-document understanding; (2) Arxiv-QA, a novel academic paper QA task with full-text scientific papers structured as citation ego-graphs; and (3) paper topic classification within a citation network. By effectively reducing positional bias and harnessing structural inductive biases, Graph-KV substantially outperforms baselines, including standard costly sequential encoding, across various settings. Code and the Graph-KV data are publicly available."

  Research on NLP",cs.CL,"  Interpretability and analysis (IA) research is a growing subfield within NLP
with the goal of developing a deeper understanding of the behavior or inner
workings of NLP systems and methods. Despite growing interest in the subfield,
a criticism of this work is that it lacks actionable insights and therefore has
little impact on NLP. In this paper, we seek to quantify the impact of IA
research on the broader field of NLP. We approach this with a mixed-methods
analysis of: (1) a citation graph of 185K+ papers built from all papers
published at ACL and EMNLP conferences from 2018 to 2023, and their references
and citations, and (2) a survey of 138 members of the NLP community. Our
quantitative results show that IA work is well-cited outside of IA, and central
in the NLP citation graph. Through qualitative analysis of survey responses and
manual annotation of 556 papers, we find that NLP researchers build on findings
from IA work and perceive it as important for progress in NLP, multiple
subfields, and rely on its findings and terminology for their own work. Many
novel methods are proposed based on IA findings and highly influenced by them,
but highly influential non-IA work cites IA findings without being driven by
them. We end by summarizing what is missing in IA work today and provide a call
to action, to pave the way for a more impactful future of IA research.

analyze changes in structures of coauthorship and citation between 1986 and
2013. Statistical models reveal significant but distinct patterns between
papers and authors in how brokerage and closure in these networks affects
impact as measured by citations and downloads. Specifically, impact is unduly
influenced by structural position, such that ideas introduced by those in the
core of the CSCW community (e.g., elite researchers) are advantaged over those
introduced by peripheral participants (e.g., newcomers). This finding is
examined in the context of recent changes to the CSCW conference that may have
the effect of upsetting the preference for contributions from the core.

  Statistical Network Model",stat.AP cs.DL physics.soc-ph,"  The significance and influence of US Supreme Court majority opinions derive
in large part from opinions' roles as precedents for future opinions. A growing
body of literature seeks to understand what drives the use of opinions as
precedents through the study of Supreme Court case citation patterns. We raise
two limitations of existing work on Supreme Court citations. First, dyadic
citations are typically aggregated to the case level before they are analyzed.
Second, citations are treated as if they arise independently. We present a
methodology for studying citations between Supreme Court opinions at the dyadic
level, as a network, that overcomes these limitations. This methodology -- the
citation exponential random graph model, for which we provide user-friendly
software -- enables researchers to account for the effects of case
characteristics and complex forms of network dependence in citation formation.
We then analyze a network that includes all Supreme Court cases decided between
1950 and 2015. We find evidence for dependence processes, including
reciprocity, transitivity, and popularity. The dependence effects are as
substantively and statistically significant as the effects of exogenous
covariates, indicating that models of Supreme Court citation should incorporate
both the effects of case characteristics and the structure of past citations.

all study journals download and citation counts per article positively
correlate, little overlap may exist between the set of articles appearing in
the top of the citation distribution and that with the most frequently

between reader and author populations in a subject field, the type of document

all provide possible explanations of differences between download and citation

  comparative analysis",cs.DL,"  It is several years since national research evaluation systems around the
globe started making use of quantitative indicators to measure the performance
of researchers. Nevertheless, the effects on these systems on the behavior of
the evaluated researchers are still largely unknown. We attempt to shed light
on this topic by investigating how Italian researchers reacted to the
introduction in 2011 of national regulations in which key passages of
professional careers are governed by bibliometric indicators. A new inwardness
measure, able to gauge the degree of scientific self-referentiality of a
country, is defined as the proportion of citations coming from the country
itself compared to the total number of citations gathered by the country.
Compared to the trends of the other G10 countries in the period 2000-2016,
Italy's inwardness shows a net increase after the introduction of the new
evaluation rules. Indeed, globally and also for a large majority of the
research fields, Italy became the European country with the highest inwardness.
Possible explanations are proposed and discussed, concluding that the observed
trends are strongly suggestive of a generalized strategic use of citations,
both in the form of author self-citations and of citation clubs. We argue that
the Italian case offers crucial insights on the constitutive effects of
evaluation systems. As such, it could become a paradigmatic case in the debate
about the use of indicators in science-policy contexts.

gnn_citations,graph neural networks for citation analysis,530,2311.00115,0.67449343,EXTRACT: Explainable Transparent Control of Bias in Embeddings,cs.LG cs.CY,"  Knowledge Graphs are a widely used method to represent relations between
entities in various AI applications, and Graph Embedding has rapidly become a
standard technique to represent Knowledge Graphs in such a way as to facilitate
inferences and decisions. As this representation is obtained from behavioural
data, and is not in a form readable by humans, there is a concern that it might
incorporate unintended information that could lead to biases. We propose
EXTRACT: a suite of Explainable and Transparent methods to ConTrol bias in
knowledge graph embeddings, so as to assess and decrease the implicit presence
of protected information. Our method uses Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)
to investigate the presence, extent and origins of information leaks during
training, then decomposes embeddings into a sum of their private attributes by
solving a linear system. Our experiments, performed on the MovieLens1M dataset,
show that a range of personal attributes can be inferred from a user's viewing
behaviour and preferences, including gender, age, and occupation. Further
experiments, performed on the KG20C citation dataset, show that the information
about the conference in which a paper was published can be inferred from the
citation network of that article. We propose four transparent methods to
maintain the capability of the embedding to make the intended predictions
without retaining unwanted information. A trade-off between these two goals is
observed.

to some people at the expense of others, for example, by giving them
substantially more influence and opportunities. Using bibliometric data about
authors of scientific publications, we identify two types of structural
inequalities in scientific citations. First, female authors, who represent a
minority of researchers, receive less recognition for their work (through
citations) relative to male authors; second, authors affiliated with top-ranked
institutions, who are also a minority, receive substantially more recognition
compared to other authors. We present a model for the growth of directed
citation networks and show that citations disparities arise from individual
preferences to cite authors from the same group (homophily), highly cited or
active authors (preferential attachment), as well as the size of the group and
how frequently new authors join. We analyze the model and show that its
predictions align well with real-world observations. Our theoretical and
empirical analysis also suggests potential strategies to mitigate structural
inequalities in science. In particular, we find that merely increasing the
minority group size does little to narrow the disparities. Instead, reducing
the homophily of each group, frequently adding new authors to a research field
while providing them an accessible platform among existing, established
authors, together with balanced group sizes can have the largest impact on
reducing inequality. Our work highlights additional complexities of mitigating
structural disparities stemming from asymmetric relations (e.g., directed
citations) compared to symmetric relations (e.g., collaborations).

logistic regression model, for the citation network. It is noticed that neither
a latent factor model nor a logistic regression model alone is sufficient to
capture the structure of the data. The proposed model has a latent (i.e.,
factor analysis) model to represents the main technological trends (a.k.a.,
factors), and adds a sparse component that captures the remaining ad-hoc
dependence. Parameter estimation is carried out through the construction of a
joint-likelihood function of edges and properly chosen penalty terms. The
convexity of the objective function allows us to develop an efficient
algorithm, while the penalty terms push towards a low-dimensional latent
component and a sparse graphical structure. Simulation results show that the
proposed method works well in practical situations. The proposed method has
been applied to a real application, which contains a citation network of
statisticians (Ji and Jin, 2016). Some interesting findings are reported.

It seeks to pinpoint agents within a network that, if selected as single diffusion seeds, disseminate information most effectively. Multilayer networks, a specific class of heterogeneous graphs, can capture diverse types of interactions (e.g., physical-virtual or professional-social), and thus offer a more accurate representation of complex relational structures. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to identifying super-spreaders in such networks by leveraging graph neural networks. To this end, we construct a dataset by simulating information diffusion across hundreds of networks - to the best of our knowledge, the first of its kind tailored specifically to multilayer networks. We further formulate the task as a variation of the ranking prediction problem based on a four-dimensional vector that quantifies each agent's spreading potential: (i) the number of activations; (ii) the duration of the diffusion process; (iii) the peak number of activations; and (iv) the simulation step at which this peak occurs. Our model, TopSpreadersNetwork, comprises a relationship-agnostic encoder and a custom aggregation layer. This design enables generalisation to previously unseen data and adapts to varying graph sizes. In an extensive evaluation, we compare our model against classic centrality-based heuristics and competitive deep learning methods. The results, obtained across a broad spectrum of real-world and synthetic multilayer networks, demonstrate that TopSpreadersNetwork achieves superior performance in identifying high-impact nodes, while also offering improved interpretability through its structured output."

  research as compared to basic research",cs.DL,"  Background: Citation analysis has become an important tool for research
performance assessment in the medical sciences. However, different areas of
medical research may have considerably different citation practices, even
within the same medical field. Because of this, it is unclear to what extent
citation-based bibliometric indicators allow for valid comparisons between
research units active in different areas of medical research.
  Methodology: A visualization methodology is introduced that reveals
differences in citation practices between medical research areas. The
methodology extracts terms from the titles and abstracts of a large collection
of publications and uses these terms to visualize the structure of a medical
field and to indicate how research areas within this field differ from each
other in their average citation impact.
  Results: Visualizations are provided for 32 medical fields, defined based on
journal subject categories in the Web of Science database. The analysis focuses
on three fields. In each of these fields, there turn out to be large
differences in citation practices between research areas. Low-impact research
areas tend to focus on clinical intervention research, while high-impact
research areas are often more oriented on basic and diagnostic research.
  Conclusions: Popular bibliometric indicators, such as the h-index and the
impact factor, do not correct for differences in citation practices between
medical fields. These indicators therefore cannot be used to make accurate
between-field comparisons. More sophisticated bibliometric indicators do
correct for field differences but still fail to take into account within-field
heterogeneity in citation practices. As a consequence, the citation impact of
clinical intervention research may be substantially underestimated in
comparison with basic and diagnostic research.

subject-invariant features from electroencephalogram (EEG) for classification
tasks. This approach holds the underlying assumption that electrodes are
equidistant analogous to pixels of an image and hence fails to explore/exploit
the complex functional neural connectivity between different electrode sites.
We overcome this limitation by tailoring the concepts of convolution and
pooling applied to 2D grid-like inputs for the functional network of electrode
sites. Furthermore, we develop various graph neural network (GNN) models that
project electrodes onto the nodes of a graph, where the node features are
represented as EEG channel samples collected over a trial, and nodes can be
connected by weighted/unweighted edges according to a flexible policy
formulated by a neuroscientist. The empirical evaluations show that our
proposed GNN-based framework outperforms standard CNN classifiers across ErrP,
and RSVP datasets, as well as allowing neuroscientific interpretability and
explainability to deep learning methods tailored to EEG related classification
problems. Another practical advantage of our GNN-based framework is that it can
be used in EEG channel selection, which is critical for reducing computational
cost, and designing portable EEG headsets.

  Single-Event Embedding Model",cs.SI cs.AI cs.DL,"  Understanding the structure and dynamics of scientific research, i.e., the
science of science (SciSci), has become an important area of research in order
to address imminent questions including how scholars interact to advance
science, how disciplines are related and evolve, and how research impact can be
quantified and predicted. Central to the study of SciSci has been the analysis
of citation networks. Here, two prominent modeling methodologies have been
employed: one is to assess the citation impact dynamics of papers using
parametric distributions, and the other is to embed the citation networks in a
latent space optimal for characterizing the static relations between papers in
terms of their citations. Interestingly, citation networks are a prominent
example of single-event dynamic networks, i.e., networks for which each dyad
only has a single event (i.e., the point in time of citation). We presently
propose a novel likelihood function for the characterization of such
single-event networks. Using this likelihood, we propose the Dynamic Impact
Single-Event Embedding model (DISEE). The \textsc{\modelabbrev} model
characterizes the scientific interactions in terms of a latent distance model
in which random effects account for citation heterogeneity while the
time-varying impact is characterized using existing parametric representations
for assessment of dynamic impact. We highlight the proposed approach on several
real citation networks finding that the DISEE well reconciles static latent
distance network embedding approaches with classical dynamic impact
assessments.

explicitly or implicitly include ""direct"" and ""indirect"" (learning about a
cited paper's existence from references in another paper) citation mechanisms.
Our model departs from the usual, unrealistic assumption of uniform probability
of direct citation, in which initial differences in citation arise purely
randomly. Instead, we demonstrate that a two-mechanism model in which the
probability of direct citation is proportional to the number of authors on a
paper (team size) is able to reproduce the empirical citation distributions of
articles published in the field of astronomy remarkably well, and at different
points in time. Interpretation of our model is that the intrinsic citation
capacity, and hence the initial visibility of a paper, will be enhanced when
more people are intimately familiar with some work, favoring papers from larger
teams. While the intrinsic citation capacity cannot depend only on the team
size, our model demonstrates that it must be to some degree correlated with it,
and distributed in a similar way, i.e., having a power-law tail. Consequently,
our team-size model qualitatively explains the existence of a correlation
between the number of citations and the number of authors on a paper.

growth potential of the technology cluster of the patent. Because even if the
cluster of a patent has no hope of growing, we recognize the patent is
important if PageRank or other ranking score is high. Therefore, there arises a
necessity of developing citation network clustering and prediction of future
citations. In our research, clustering of patent citation networks by
Stochastic Block Model was done with the aim of enabling corporate managers and
investors to evaluate the scale and life cycle of technology. As a result, we
confirmed nested SBM is appropriate for graph clustering of patent citation
networks. Also, a high MAPE value was obtained and the direction accuracy
achieved a value greater than 50% when predicting growth potential for each
cluster by using LSTM.

  Recommendation Systems",cs.AI cs.LG,"  This survey provides an examination of the use of Deep Neural Networks (DNN)
in Collaborative Filtering (CF) recommendation systems. As the digital world
increasingly relies on data-driven approaches, traditional CF techniques face
limitations in scalability and flexibility. DNNs can address these challenges
by effectively modeling complex, non-linear relationships within the data. We
begin by exploring the fundamental principles of both collaborative filtering
and deep neural networks, laying the groundwork for understanding their
integration. Subsequently, we review key advancements in the field,
categorizing various deep learning models that enhance CF systems, including
Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNN), Graph Neural Networks (GNN), autoencoders, Generative
Adversarial Networks (GAN), and Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM). The paper
also discusses evaluation protocols, various publicly available auxiliary
information, and data features. Furthermore, the survey concludes with a
discussion of the challenges and future research opportunities in enhancing
collaborative filtering systems with deep learning.

recommending related literature to a given context. Typically, in a scientific
context the simple presentation of related content is not sufficient. Often the
users demand a more detailed view on the connection of a document and its
specific recommendations. The aim of pennants introduced by Howard White (2007)
is to provide the user with a graph showing the relatedness / distance between
a given document and related documents. Co-citation but also co-occurrence
analysis are established methods for finding related documents to a seed. A
seed could be for instance an author, a keyword, or a publication. In this
paper we introduce a recommender system in the digital library sowiport using
pennant diagrams which can be created from co-citation and/or co-occurrence
analysis. The presentation at the NKOS workshop will present demos of pennants
in sowiport and will elaborate on practical questions in visualizing pennants
and evaluating the utility of pennants for search.

and limited discriminating power as a result of suboptimally expressive
aggregating mechanisms. We herein present a unifying framework for stochastic
aggregation (STAG) in GNNs, where noise is (adaptively) injected into the
aggregation process from the neighborhood to form node embeddings. We provide
theoretical arguments that STAG models, with little overhead, remedy both of
the aforementioned problems. In addition to fixed-noise models, we also propose
probabilistic versions of STAG models and a variational inference framework to
learn the noise posterior. We conduct illustrative experiments clearly
targeting oversmoothing and multiset aggregation limitations. Furthermore, STAG
enhances general performance of GNNs demonstrated by competitive performance in
common citation and molecule graph benchmark datasets.

  analysis using citation and Twitter data",cs.DL,"  Thelwall (2017a, 2017b) proposed a new family of field- and time-normalized
indicators, which is intended for sparse data. These indicators are based on
units of analysis (e.g., institutions) rather than on the paper level. They
compare the proportion of mentioned papers (e.g., on Twitter) of a unit with
the proportion of mentioned papers in the corresponding fields and publication
years (the expected values). We propose a new indicator (Mantel-Haenszel
quotient, MHq) for the indicator family. The MHq goes back to the MH analysis.
This analysis is an established method, which can be used to pool the data from
several 2x2 cross tables based on different subgroups. We investigate (using
citations and assessments by peers, i.e., F1000Prime recommendations) whether
the indicator family (including the MHq) can distinguish between quality levels
defined by the assessments of peers. Thus, we test the convergent validity. We
find that the MHq is able to distinguish between quality levels (in most cases)
while other indicators of the family are not. Since our study approves the MHq
as a convergent valid indicator, we apply the MHq to four different Twitter
groups as defined by the company Altmetric (e.g., science communicators). Our
results show that there is a weak relationship between all four Twitter groups
and scientific quality, much weaker than between citations and scientific
quality. Therefore, our results discourage the use of Twitter counts in
research evaluation.

knowledge accumulation and maintains academic integrity. However, citing
properly is not an easy task. For published scientific entities, the
ever-growing academic publications and over-familiarity of terms easily lead to
missing citations. To deal with this situation, we design a special method
Citation Recommendation for Published Scientific Entity (CRPSE) based on the
cooccurrences between published scientific entities and in-text citations in
the same sentences from previous researchers. Experimental outcomes show the
effectiveness of our method in recommending the source papers for published
scientific entities. We further conduct a statistical analysis on missing
citations among papers published in prestigious computer science conferences in
2020. In the 12,278 papers collected, 475 published scientific entities of
computer science and mathematics are found to have missing citations. Many
entities mentioned without citations are found to be well-accepted research
results. On a median basis, the papers proposing these published scientific
entities with missing citations were published 8 years ago, which can be
considered the time frame for a published scientific entity to develop into a
well-accepted concept. For published scientific entities, we appeal for
accurate and full citation of their source papers as required by academic
standards.

  the humanities, for the humanities",cs.DL,"  Citation indexes are by now part of the research infrastructure in use by
most scientists: a necessary tool in order to cope with the increasing amounts
of scientific literature being published. Commercial citation indexes are
designed for the sciences and have uneven coverage and unsatisfactory
characteristics for humanities scholars, while no comprehensive citation index
is published by a public organization. We argue that an open citation index for
the humanities is desirable, for four reasons: it would greatly improve and
accelerate the retrieval of sources, it would offer a way to interlink
collections across repositories (such as archives and libraries), it would
foster the adoption of metadata standards and best practices by all
stakeholders (including publishers) and it would contribute research data to
fields such as bibliometrics and science studies. We also suggest that the
citation index should be informed by a set of requirements relevant to the
humanities. We discuss four such requirements: source coverage must be
comprehensive, including books and citations to primary sources; there needs to
be chronological depth, as scholarship in the humanities remains relevant over
time; the index should be collection-driven, leveraging the accumulated
thematic collections of specialized research libraries; and it should be rich
in context in order to allow for the qualification of each citation, for
example by providing citation excerpts. We detail the fit-for-purpose research
infrastructure which can make the Humanities Citation Index a reality.
Ultimately, we argue that a citation index for the humanities can be created by
humanists, via a collaborative, distributed and open effort.

citation impact of recent publications. We propose a model to predict a
probability distribution for the future number of citations of a publication.
Two predictors are used: The impact factor of the journal in which a
publication has appeared and the number of citations a publication has received
one year after its appearance. The proposed model is based on quantile
regression. We employ the model to predict the future number of citations of a
large set of publications in the field of physics. Our analysis shows that both
predictors (i.e., impact factor and early citations) contribute to the accurate
prediction of long-term citation impact. We also analytically study the
behavior of the quantile regression coefficients for high quantiles of the
distribution of citations. This is done by linking the quantile regression
approach to a quantile estimation technique from extreme value theory. Our work
provides insight into the influence of the impact factor and early citations on
the long-term citation impact of a publication, and it takes a step toward a
methodology that can be used to assess research institutions based on their
most recently published work.

  contribute",cs.LG stat.ML,"  Wikipedia is a huge opportunity for machine learning, being the largest
semi-structured base of knowledge available. Because of this, many works
examine its contents, and focus on structuring it in order to make it usable in
learning tasks, for example by classifying it into an ontology. Beyond its
textual contents, Wikipedia also displays a typical graph structure, where
pages are linked together through citations. In this paper, we address the task
of integrating graph (i.e. structure) information to classify Wikipedia into a
fine-grained named entity ontology (NE), the Extended Named Entity hierarchy.
To address this task, we first start by assessing the relevance of the graph
structure for NE classification. We then explore two directions, one related to
feature vectors using graph descriptors commonly used in large-scale network
analysis, and one extending flat classification to a weighted model taking into
account semantic similarity. We conduct at-scale practical experiments, on a
manually labeled subset of 22,000 pages extracted from the Japanese Wikipedia.
Our results show that integrating graph information succeeds at reducing
sparsity of the input feature space, and yields classification results that are
comparable or better than previous works.

a low to moderate correlation with citations, depending on the platform and the

unit of analysis to determine whether the attention they received on Twitter
was a good predictor of academic engagement. Our work revisits the relationship
between tweets and citations where the tweet itself is the unit of analysis,
and the question is to determine if, at the individual level, the act of
tweeting an academic work can shed light on the likelihood of the act of citing
that same work. We model this relationship by considering the research activity
of the tweeter and its relationship to the tweeted work. Results show that
tweeters are more likely to cite works affiliated with their same institution,
works published in journals in which they also have published, and works in
which they hold authorship. It finds that the older the academic age of a
tweeter the less likely they are to cite what they tweet, though there is a
positive relationship between citations and the number of works they have
published and references they have accumulated over time.

subjective factors such as the importance of a paper or even the worth of
individual researchers. Here we analyze the citation histories of $4669$ papers
published in journals of the American Physical Society between $1960$ and
$1968$ and argue that state-of-the-art models of citation dynamics and
algorithms for forecasting nonstationary time series are very likely to fail to
predict the long-term ($50$ years after publication) citation counts of
highly-cited papers using citation data collected in a short period (say, $10$
years) after publication. This is so because those papers do not exhibit
distinctive short-term citation patterns, although their long-term citation
patterns clearly set them apart from the other papers. We conclude that even if
one accepts that citation counts are proxies for the quality of papers, they
are not useful evaluative tools since the short-term counts are not informative
about the long-term counts in the case of highly-cited papers.

  Citation Bias at the Institution and Country Level",cs.DL,"  Citing is an important aspect of scientific discourse and important for
quantifying the scientific impact quantification of researchers. Previous works
observed that citations are made not only based on the pure scholarly
contributions but also based on non-scholarly attributes, such as the
affiliation or gender of authors. In this way, citation bias is produced.
Existing works, however, have not analyzed preprints with respect to citation
bias, although they play an increasingly important role in modern scholarly
communication. In this paper, we investigate whether preprints are affected by
citation bias with respect to the author affiliation. We measure citation bias
for bioRxiv preprints and their publisher versions at the institution level and
country level, using the Lorenz curve and Gini coefficient. This allows us to
mitigate the effects of confounding factors and see whether or not citation
biases related to author affiliation have an increased effect on preprint
citations. We observe consistent higher Gini coefficients for preprints than
those for publisher versions. Thus, we can confirm that citation bias exists
and that it is more severe in case of preprints. As preprints are on the rise,
affiliation-based citation bias is, thus, an important topic not only for
authors (e.g., when deciding what to cite), but also to people and institutions
that use citations for scientific impact quantification (e.g., funding agencies
deciding about funding based on citation counts).

  lme4 R package",cs.DL,"  The rise of software as a research object is mirrored in the increasing
interests towards quantitative studies of scientific software. However, due to
the inconsistent practice of citing software, most of the existing studies
analyzing the impact of scientific software are based on identification of
software name mentions in full-text publications. Despite its limitations,
citation data have a much larger quantity and broader coverage of scientific
fields than full-text data and thus could support findings in much larger
scopes. This paper presents an analysis aiming to evaluate the extent to which
citations data can be used to reconstruct the impact of software. Specifically,
we identified the variety of citable objects related to the lme4 R package and
examined how the package's impact is scattered across these objects. Our
results reveal a little-discussed challenge of using citation data to measure
the impact of software, that even within the category of formal citation, there
might be different forms in which the same software object is cited. This
challenge can be mitigated by more carefully selecting objects as the proxy of
software. However, it cannot be fully solved until we have
one-software-one-proxy policy for software citation.

The task has evolved as generative approaches have become more promising than the traditional pre-fetch and re-rank-based state-of-the-art approaches. This paper introduces citation-specific pre-training within an encoder-decoder architecture, where author-date citation tokens are masked to learn to reconstruct them to fulfill LCR. There are two variants for this pre-training. In the local context-only base scheme (CiteBART-Base), the citation token in a local context is masked to learn to predict the citation. The global version (CiteBART-Global) extends the local context with the citing paper's title and abstract to enrich the learning signal. CiteBART-Global achieves state-of-the-art performance on LCR benchmarks except for the FullTextPeerRead dataset, which is quite small to see the advantage of generative pre-training. The effect is significant in the larger benchmarks, e.g., Refseer and ArXiv., with the Refseer benchmark-trained model emerging as the best-performing model. We perform comprehensive experiments, including an ablation study, a qualitative analysis, and a taxonomy of hallucinations with detailed statistics. Our analyses confirm that CiteBART-Global has a cross-dataset generalization capability; the macro hallucination rate (MaHR) at the top-3 predictions is 4\%, and when the ground-truth is in the top-k prediction list, the hallucination tendency in the other predictions drops significantly."

academic graphs, consist of nodes with textual features linked by various
relations. Traditional graph machine learning models, such as Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs), excel in encoding the graph structural information, but have
limited capability in handling rich text on graph nodes. Large Language Models
(LLMs), noted for their superior text understanding abilities, offer a solution
for processing the text in graphs but face integration challenges due to their
limitation for encoding graph structures and their computational complexities
when dealing with extensive text in large neighborhoods of interconnected
nodes. This paper introduces ``Hierarchical Compression'' (HiCom), a novel
method to align the capabilities of LLMs with the structure of text-rich
graphs. HiCom processes text in a node's neighborhood in a structured manner by
organizing the extensive textual information into a more manageable hierarchy
and compressing node text step by step. Therefore, HiCom not only preserves the
contextual richness of the text but also addresses the computational challenges
of LLMs, which presents an advancement in integrating the text processing power
of LLMs with the structural complexities of text-rich graphs. Empirical results
show that HiCom can outperform both GNNs and LLM backbones for node
classification on e-commerce and citation graphs. HiCom is especially effective
for nodes from a dense region in a graph, where it achieves a 3.48% average
performance improvement on five datasets while being more efficient than LLM
backbones.

insights into the ""The Biological Bulletin"", the journal published since 1897
by the Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratory. Since the bibliographic
networks tend to be very scattered, their visualization requires of criteria of
convergence. To simplify, the main features in such a structure should include
the survey for authoritative sources in the hyperlinked environment and the
identification of thematic areas. By avoiding excessive loose connections and
too dense clustered layouts to be useful, a smooth presentation is obtained by
graphically depicting the citation patterns. HistComp computes 8884 articles
published by 'The Biological Bulletin' between 1945-2003. A two-dimensional
positioning of these papers that represent the extent of their bibliographic
coupling and co-citation is offered as a histograph. The criteria to construct
it is the adequateness of the visualization relative to the 8884 data set. The
spatial representation obtained optimizes the identification of the clusters or
topic areas. The thematic importance of marine science involves its
participation in 7 of the 7 presenting clusters. The mainstream subjects were
crustaceans and echinoderms, with some 60% of the material presented in the
graph. But sea anemone, with about 16% of the total, remains as the best
visualized topical area. A perspective of the highly relevant papers is readily
confirmed by the visual inspection of width of the glyphs used for nodes
representation. For user interaction, HistComp employs mouse-over labels.

approaches for semi-supervised learning, as they can exploit the connectivity
patterns between labeled and unlabeled data samples to improve learning
performance. However, existing graph-based methods either are limited in their
ability to jointly model graph structures and data features, such as the
classical label propagation methods, or require a considerable amount of
labeled data for training and validation due to high model complexity, such as
the recent neural-network-based methods. In this paper, we address label
efficient semi-supervised learning from a graph filtering perspective.
Specifically, we propose a graph filtering framework that injects graph
similarity into data features by taking them as signals on the graph and
applying a low-pass graph filter to extract useful data representations for
classification, where label efficiency can be achieved by conveniently
adjusting the strength of the graph filter. Interestingly, this framework
unifies two seemingly very different methods -- label propagation and graph
convolutional networks. Revisiting them under the graph filtering framework
leads to new insights that improve their modeling capabilities and reduce model
complexity. Experiments on various semi-supervised classification tasks on four
citation networks and one knowledge graph and one semi-supervised regression
task for zero-shot image recognition validate our findings and proposals.

a linear growth in some citation networks, a geometric model is thus proposed
to predict some statistical features of those networks, in which the academic
influence scopes of the papers are denoted through specific geometric areas
related to time and space. In the model, nodes (papers) are uniformly and
randomly sprinkled onto a cluster of circles of the Minkowski space whose
centers are on the time axis. Edges (citations) are linked according to an
influence mechanism which indicates that an existing paper will be cited by a
new paper located in its influence zone. Considering the citations among papers
in different disciplines, an interdisciplinary citation mechanism is added to
the model in which some papers with a small probability of being chosen will
cite some existing papers randomly and uniformly. Different from most existing
models that only study the power-law tail of the in-degree distribution, this
model also characterizes the overall in-degree distribution. Moreover, it
presents the description of some other important statistical characteristics of
real networks, such as in- and out-assortativity, giant component and clear

content, known as ""hallucinations."" To mitigate this, retrieval-augmented LLMs
incorporate citations, grounding the content in verifiable sources. Despite
such developments, manually assessing how well a citation supports the
associated statement remains a major challenge. Previous studies use
faithfulness metrics to estimate citation support automatically but are limited
to binary classification, overlooking fine-grained citation support in
practical scenarios. To investigate the effectiveness of faithfulness metrics
in fine-grained scenarios, we propose a comparative evaluation framework that
assesses the metric effectiveness in distinguishing citations between
three-category support levels: full, partial, and no support. Our framework
employs correlation analysis, classification evaluation, and retrieval
evaluation to measure the alignment between metric scores and human judgments
comprehensively. Our results show no single metric consistently excels across
all evaluations, revealing the complexity of assessing fine-grained support.
Based on the findings, we provide practical recommendations for developing more

shown in artificial intelligence by replacing classical filters with

over time. We present a breadth first search (BFS) algorithm for evolving
graphs that computes the most direct influences between nodes at two different
times. Using simple examples, we show that naive unfoldings of adjacency
matrices miscount the number of temporal paths. By mapping an evolving graph to
an adjacency matrix of an equivalent static graph, we prove that our
generalization of the BFS algorithm correctly accounts for paths that traverse
both space and time. Finally, we demonstrate how the BFS over evolving graphs
can be applied to mine citation networks.

  Cross-Covariance Graphs",cs.LG stat.ML,"  Neural tangent kernels (NTKs) provide a theoretical regime to analyze the
learning and generalization behavior of over-parametrized neural networks. For
a supervised learning task, the association between the eigenvectors of the NTK
kernel and given data (a concept referred to as alignment in this paper) can
govern the rate of convergence of gradient descent, as well as generalization
to unseen data. Building upon this concept, we investigate NTKs and alignment
in the context of graph neural networks (GNNs), where our analysis reveals that
optimizing alignment translates to optimizing the graph representation or the
graph shift operator in a GNN. Our results further establish the theoretical
guarantees on the optimality of the alignment for a two-layer GNN and these
guarantees are characterized by the graph shift operator being a function of
the cross-covariance between the input and the output data. The theoretical
insights drawn from the analysis of NTKs are validated by our experiments
focused on a multi-variate time series prediction task for a publicly available
dataset. Specifically, they demonstrate that GNNs with cross-covariance as the
graph shift operator indeed outperform those that operate on the covariance
matrix from only the input data.

  Approach",cs.SI,"  Multimodal data empowers machine learning models to better understand the
world from various perspectives. In this work, we study the combination of
\emph{text and graph} modalities, a challenging but understudied combination
which is prevalent across multiple settings including citation networks, social
media, and the web. We focus on the popular task of node classification using
limited labels; in particular, under the zero- and few-shot scenarios. In
contrast to the standard pipeline which feeds standard precomputed (e.g.,
bag-of-words) text features into a graph neural network, we propose
\textbf{T}ext-\textbf{A}nd-\textbf{G}raph (TAG) learning, a more deeply
multimodal approach that integrates the raw texts and graph topology into the
model design, and can effectively learn from limited supervised signals without
any meta-learning procedure. TAG is a two-stage model with (1) a prompt- and
graph-based module which generates prior logits that can be directly used for
zero-shot node classification, and (2) a trainable module that further
calibrates these prior logits in a few-shot manner. Experiments on two node
classification datasets show that TAG outperforms all the baselines by a large
margin in both zero- and few-shot settings.

  for Scholar Recommendation",cs.IR,"  Due to the availability of references of research papers and the rich
information contained in papers, various citation analysis approaches have been
proposed to identify similar documents for scholar recommendation. Despite of
the success of previous approaches, they are, however, based on co-occurrence
of items. Once there are no co-occurrence items available in documents, they
will not work well. Inspired by distributed representations of words in the
literature of natural language processing, we propose a novel approach to
measuring the similarity of papers based on distributed representations learned
from the citation context of papers. We view the set of papers as the
vocabulary, define the weighted citation context of papers, and convert it to
weight matrix similar to the word-word cooccurrence matrix in natural language
processing. After that we explore a variant of matrix factorization approach to
train distributed representations of papers on the matrix, and leverage the
distributed representations to measure similarities of papers. In the
experiment, we exhibit that our approach outperforms state-of-theart
citation-based approaches by 25%, and better than other distributed

between neurons shape the activity of neural circuits in the brain. In this
chapter, we study Combinatorial Threshold-Linear Networks (CTLNs) in order to
understand how the pattern of connectivity, as encoded by a directed graph,
shapes the emergent nonlinear dynamics of the corresponding network. Important
aspects of these dynamics are controlled by the stable and unstable fixed
points of the network, and we show how these fixed points can be determined via
graph-based rules. We also present an algorithm for predicting sequences of
neural activation from the underlying directed graph, and examine the effect of
graph symmetries on a network's set of attractors.

development more effective. In this paper, we report an analysis of the
organization and interconnection between two important issues in chemistry,
namely mass spectrometry (MS) and capillary electrophoresis (CE). For that
purpose, we employed science of science techniques based on complex networks.
More specifically, we considered a citation network in which the nodes and
connections represent papers and citations, respectively. Interesting results
were found, including a good separation between some clusters of articles
devoted to instrumentation techniques and applications. However, the papers
that describe CE-MS did not lead to a well-defined cluster. In order to better
understand the organization of the citation network, we considered a
multi-scale analysis, in which we used the information regarding sub-clusters.
Firstly, we analyzed the sub-cluster of the first article devoted to the
coupling between CE and MS, which was found to be a good representation of its
sub-cluster. The second analysis was about the sub-cluster of a seminal paper
known to be the first that dealt with proteins by using CE-MS. By considering
the proposed methodologies, our paper paves the way for researchers working
with both techniques, since it elucidates the knowledge organization and can
therefore lead to better literature reviews.

  Relate Uncited Papers On Grounds of Citation Proximity",cs.DL cs.IR cs.LG,"  Citation based approaches have seen good progress for recommending research
papers using citations in the paper. Citation proximity analysis which uses the
in-text citation proximity to find relatedness between two research papers is
better than co-citation analysis and bibliographic analysis. However, one
common problem which exists in each approach is that paper should be well
cited. If documents are not cited properly or not cited at all, then using
these approaches will not be helpful. To overcome the problem, this paper
discusses the approach Virtual Citation Proximity (VCP) which uses Siamese
Neural Network along with the notion of citation proximity analysis and
content-based filtering. To train this model, the actual distance between the
two citations in a document is used as ground truth, this distance is the word
count between the two citations. VCP is trained on Wikipedia articles for which
the actual word count is available which is used to calculate the similarity
between the documents. This can be used to calculate relatedness between two
documents in a way they would have been cited in the proximity even if the
documents are uncited. This approach has shown a great improvement in
predicting proximity with basic neural networks over the approach which uses
the Average Citation Proximity index value as the ground truth. This can be
improved by using a complex neural network and proper hyper tuning of
parameters.

  Models",cs.CL,"  Graph-structured data plays a vital role in numerous domains, such as social
networks, citation networks, commonsense reasoning graphs and knowledge graphs.
While graph neural networks have been employed for graph processing, recent
advancements have explored integrating large language models for graph-based
tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Learnable Graph Pooling
Token (LGPT), which addresses the limitations of the scalability issues in
node-level projection and information loss in graph-level projection. LGPT
enables flexible and efficient graph representation by introducing learnable
parameters that act as tokens in large language models, balancing fine-grained
and global graph information. Additionally, we investigate an Early Query
Fusion technique, which fuses query context before constructing the graph
representation, leading to more effective graph embeddings. Our method achieves
a 4.13\% performance improvement on the GraphQA benchmark without training the
large language model, demonstrating significant gains in handling complex
textual-attributed graph data.

gnn_citations,graph neural networks for citation analysis,582,1312.1794,0.6686006,Statistical Modelling of Citation Exchange Between Statistics Journals,stat.AP cs.DL,"  Rankings of scholarly journals based on citation data are often met with
skepticism by the scientific community. Part of the skepticism is due to
disparity between the common perception of journals' prestige and their ranking
based on citation counts. A more serious concern is the inappropriate use of
journal rankings to evaluate the scientific influence of authors. This paper
focuses on analysis of the table of cross-citations among a selection of
Statistics journals. Data are collected from the Web of Science database
published by Thomson Reuters. Our results suggest that modelling the exchange
of citations between journals is useful to highlight the most prestigious
journals, but also that journal citation data are characterized by considerable
heterogeneity, which needs to be properly summarized. Inferential conclusions
require care in order to avoid potential over-interpretation of insignificant
differences between journal ratings. Comparison with published ratings of
institutions from the UK's Research Assessment Exercise shows strong
correlation at aggregate level between assessed research quality and journal
citation `export scores' within the discipline of Statistics.

  Using Temporal Knowledge Graph",cs.AI cs.SI,"  Predicting the impact of publications in science and technology has become an
important research area, which is useful in various real world scenarios such
as technology investment, research direction selection, and technology
policymaking. Citation trajectory prediction is one of the most popular tasks
in this area. Existing approaches mainly rely on mining temporal and graph data
from academic articles. Some recent methods are capable of handling cold-start
prediction by aggregating metadata features of new publications. However, the
implicit factors causing citations and the richer information from handling
temporal and attribute features still need to be explored. In this paper, we
propose CTPIR, a new citation trajectory prediction framework that is able to
represent the influence (the momentum of citation) of either new or existing
publications using the history information of all their attributes. Our
framework is composed of three modules: difference-preserved graph embedding,
fine-grained influence representation, and learning-based trajectory
calculation. To test the effectiveness of our framework in more situations, we
collect and construct a new temporal knowledge graph dataset from the real
world, named AIPatent, which stems from global patents in the field of
artificial intelligence. Experiments are conducted on both the APS academic
dataset and our contributed AIPatent dataset. The results demonstrate the
strengths of our approach in the citation trajectory prediction task.

math departments of various tiered rankings in the United States, as a case
study to demonstrate the statistical and mathematical relationships among
several variables, e.g., the number of publications and citations, the rank of
professorship and AMS fellow status. At first we do an exploratory data
analysis of the math departments. Then various statistical tools, including
regression, artificial neural network, and unsupervised learning, are applied
and the results obtained from different methods are compared. We conclude that
with more advanced models, it may be possible to design an automatic promotion
algorithm that has the potential to be fairer, more efficient and more
consistent than human approach.

and diverse downstream tasks by conditioning on prompt examples, without
optimizing any parameters. While large language models have demonstrated this
ability, how in-context learning could be performed over graphs is unexplored.
In this paper, we develop \textbf{Pr}etraining \textbf{O}ver \textbf{D}iverse
\textbf{I}n-Context \textbf{G}raph S\textbf{y}stems (PRODIGY), the first
pretraining framework that enables in-context learning over graphs. The key
idea of our framework is to formulate in-context learning over graphs with a
novel \emph{prompt graph} representation, which connects prompt examples and
queries. We then propose a graph neural network architecture over the prompt
graph and a corresponding family of in-context pretraining objectives. With
PRODIGY, the pretrained model can directly perform novel downstream
classification tasks on unseen graphs via in-context learning. We provide
empirical evidence of the effectiveness of our framework by showcasing its
strong in-context learning performance on tasks involving citation networks and
knowledge graphs. Our approach outperforms the in-context learning accuracy of
contrastive pretraining baselines with hard-coded adaptation by 18\% on average
across all setups. Moreover, it also outperforms standard finetuning with
limited data by 33\% on average with in-context learning.

both respects the intrinsic order of a directed acyclic graph and also finds
similar nodes. We take inspiration from classic similarity measures of
bibliometrics, used to assess how similar two publications are, based on their
relative citation patterns. We study the algorithm's performance and antichain
properties in artificial models and in real networks, such as citation graphs
and food webs. We show how well this partitioning algorithm distinguishes and
groups together nodes of the same origin (in a citation network, the origin is
a topic or a research field). We make the comparison between our partitioning
algorithm and standard hierarchical layering tools as well as community
detection methods. We show that our algorithm produces different communities
from standard layering algorithms.

data such as images, but face tremendous challenges in learning from more
generic data such as graphs. In CNNs, the trainable local filters enable the
automatic extraction of high-level features. The computation with filters
requires a fixed number of ordered units in the receptive fields. However, the
number of neighboring units is neither fixed nor are they ordered in generic
graphs, thereby hindering the applications of convolutional operations. Here,
we address these challenges by proposing the learnable graph convolutional
layer (LGCL). LGCL automatically selects a fixed number of neighboring nodes
for each feature based on value ranking in order to transform graph data into
grid-like structures in 1-D format, thereby enabling the use of regular
convolutional operations on generic graphs. To enable model training on
large-scale graphs, we propose a sub-graph training method to reduce the
excessive memory and computational resource requirements suffered by prior
methods on graph convolutions. Our experimental results on node classification
tasks in both transductive and inductive learning settings demonstrate that our
methods can achieve consistently better performance on the Cora, Citeseer,
Pubmed citation network, and protein-protein interaction network datasets. Our
results also indicate that the proposed methods using sub-graph training
strategy are more efficient as compared to prior approaches.

while the citations accrued by authors are the sum of the citations of their
papers, translating the dynamics of citation accumulation from the paper to the
author level is not trivial. Here we conduct a systematic study of the
evolution of author citations, and in particular their bursty dynamics. We find
empirical evidence of a correlation between the number of citations most
recently accrued by an author and the number of citations they receive in the
future. Using a simple model where the probability for an author to receive new
citations depends only on the number of citations collected in the previous
12-24 months, we are able to reproduce both the citation and burst size
distributions of authors across multiple decades.

methodology classifies documents into three general types: Delayed documents,
which receive the main part of their citations later than normal documents;
Flash in the pans, which receive citations immediately after their publication
but they are not cited in the long term; and Normal documents, documents with a
typical distribution of citations over time. These three types of durability
have been analyzed considering the whole population of documents in the Web of

self-citations). Several patterns related to the three types of durability have
been found and the potential for further research of the developed methodology

lifecycles from quantitative studies. This paper aims to address this gap by
quantitatively examining the citation contexts of an exemplary research
instrument, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), in
full-text psychological publications. We investigated the relationship between
the citation contexts of the DSM and its status as a valid instrument being
used and described by psychological researchers. We specifically focused on how
this relationship has changed over the DSM's citation histories, especially
through the temporal framework of its versions. We found that a new version of
the DSM is increasingly regarded as a valid instrument after its publication;
this is reflected in various key citation contexts, such as the use of hedges,
attention markers, and the verb profile in sentences where the DSM is cited. We
call this process the re-instrumentalization of the DSM in the space of
scientific publications. Our findings bridge an important gap between
quantitative and qualitative science studies and shed light on an aspect of the
social process of scientific instrument development that is not addressed by

comparatively more tenuous relation between molecular biology and physics in
Brazil and USA. Other slight exceptions are the higher amount of citing of

and citing comprehensive and appropriate resources has become a non-trivial
task. Conventional citation recommender methods suffer from severe information
loss. For example, they do not consider the section of the paper that the user
is writing and for which they need to find a citation, the relatedness between
the words in the local context (the text span that describes a citation), or
the importance on each word from the local context. These shortcomings make
such methods insufficient for recommending adequate citations to academic
manuscripts. In this study, we propose a novel embedding-based neural network
called ""dual attention model for citation recommendation (DACR)"" to recommend
citations during manuscript preparation. Our method adapts embedding of three
dimensions of semantic information: words in the local context, structural
contexts, and the section on which a user is working. A neural network is
designed to maximize the similarity between the embedding of the three input
(local context words, section and structural contexts) and the target citation
appearing in the context. The core of the neural network is composed of
self-attention and additive attention, where the former aims to capture the
relatedness between the contextual words and structural context, and the latter
aims to learn the importance of them. The experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

yet such graphs are challenging to visualize. In this paper, we introduce a
novel, scalable, tree+table multivariate graph visualization technique, which
makes many tasks related to multivariate graph analysis easier to achieve. The
core principle we follow is to selectively query for nodes or subgraphs of
interest and visualize these subgraphs as a spanning tree of the graph. The
tree is laid out linearly, which enables us to juxtapose the nodes with a table
visualization where diverse attributes can be shown. We also use this table as
an adjacency matrix, so that the resulting technique is a hybrid
node-link/adjacency matrix technique. We implement this concept in Juniper and
complement it with a set of interaction techniques that enable analysts to
dynamically grow, restructure, and aggregate the tree, as well as change the
layout or show paths between nodes. We demonstrate the utility of our tool in
usage scenarios for different multivariate networks: a bipartite network of
scholars, papers, and citation metrics and a multitype network of story
characters, places, books, etc.

the citing entities' abstracts and the in-text citation contexts. As part of
our main findings, we noticed that there was no drop in the overall number of
citations after the year of retraction, with few entities which have either
mentioned the retraction or expressed a negative sentiment toward the cited
publication. In addition, on several occasions, we noticed a higher
concern/awareness when it was about citing a retracted publication, by the
citing entities belonging to the health sciences domain, if compared to the
humanities and the social science domains. Philosophy, arts, and history are
the humanities areas that showed the higher concern toward the retraction.

  anomalies in university metrics",cs.DL,"  University rankings, despite facing criticism, continue to maintain their
popularity. In the 2023 Scopus Ranking of Ukrainian Universities, certain
institutions stood out due to their high h-index, despite modest publication
and citation numbers. This phenomenon can be attributed to influential research
topics or involvement in international collaborative research. However, these
results may also be due to the authors' own efforts to increase the number of
citations of their publications in order to improve their h-index. To
investigate this, the publications from the top 30 universities in the ranking
were analysed, revealing humpback rank-citation curves for two universities.
These humpbacks indicate unusual trends in the citation data, especially
considering the high percentage of self-citations and FWCI of analysed papers.
While quantitative analysis has limitations, the combination of humped
rank-citation curves, self-citations, FWCI, and previous research findings
raises concerns about the possible causes of these anomalies in the citation
data of the analysed universities. The method presented in this paper can aid
ranking compilers and citation databases managers in identifying potential
instances of citation data anomalies, emphasizing the importance of expert
assessment for accurate conclusions.

scientific progress. We can also view them as representations of a causal
structure, a logical process captured in a graph. From a causal perspective, we
can ask questions such as whether authors form groups primarily due to their
prior shared interest, or if their favourite topics are 'contagious' and spread
through co-authorship. Such networks have been widely studied by the artificial
intelligence community, and recently a connection has been made to nonlocal
correlations produced by entangled particles in quantum physics -- the impact
of latent hidden variables can be analyzed by the same algebraic geometric
methodology that relies on a sequence of semidefinite programming (SDP)
relaxations. Following this trail, we treat our sample coauthor network as a
causal graph and, using SDP relaxations, rule out latent homophily as a
manifestation of prior shared interest leading to the observed patternedness.
By introducing algebraic geometry to citation studies, we add a new tool to
existing methods for the analysis of content-related social influences.

Open Access (OA). The purpose of the chapter is to develop a full understanding
on country patterns, OA journals characteristics and citation differences
between gold OA and non-gold OA publications. For this, we will first review
current literature regarding Open Access and its relation with its so-called
citation advantage. Starting with a chronological perspective we will describe
its development, how different countries are promoting OA publishing, and its
effects on the journal publishing industry. We will deepen the analysis by
investigating the research output produced by different units of analysis.
First, we will focus on the production of countries with a special emphasis on
citation and disciplinary differences. A point of interest will be
identification of national idiosyncrasies and the relation between OA
publication and research of local interest. This will lead to our second unit
of analysis, OA journals indexed in Web of Science. Here we will deepen on
journals characteristics and publisher types to clearly identify factors which
may affect citation differences between OA and traditional journals which may
not necessarily be derived from the OA factor. Gold OA publishing is being
encouraged in many countries as opposed to Green OA. This chapter aims at fully
understanding how it affects researchers' publication patterns and whether it
ensures an alleged citation advantage as opposed to non-gold OA publications.

Previous works suggest fine-tuning pretrained language models (PLMs) on citation classification datasets, reaping the reward of the linguistic knowledge they gained during pretraining. However, directly fine-tuning for citation classification is challenging due to labeled data scarcity, contextual noise, and spurious keyphrase correlations. In this paper, we present a novel framework, Citss, that adapts the PLMs to overcome these challenges. Citss introduces self-supervised contrastive learning to alleviate data scarcity, and is equipped with two specialized strategies to obtain the contrastive pairs: sentence-level cropping, which enhances focus on target citations within long contexts, and keyphrase perturbation, which mitigates reliance on specific keyphrases. Compared with previous works that are only designed for encoder-based PLMs, Citss is carefully developed to be compatible with both encoder-based PLMs and decoder-based LLMs, to embrace the benefits of enlarged pretraining. Experiments with three benchmark datasets with both encoder-based PLMs and decoder-based LLMs demonstrate our superiority compared to the previous state of the art.

commonly in biochemical applications. With our auxiliary architecture, the
performances of many GNNs used in practice improve more consistently, achieving
the state-of-the-art performance on popular molecular graph datasets.

However, searching for prior art is challenging due to the large number of patent documents and the need for nuanced comparisons to determine novelty. An accurate search engine is therefore invaluable for speeding up the process. We present a Graph Transformer-based dense retrieval method for patent searching where each invention is represented by a graph describing its features and their relationships. Our model processes these invention graphs and is trained using prior art citations from patent office examiners as relevance signals. Using graphs as input significantly improves the computational efficiency of processing long documents, while leveraging examiner citations allows the model to learn domain-specific similarities beyond simple text-based matching. The result is a search engine that emulates how professional patent examiners identify relevant documents. We compare our approach against publicly available text embedding models and show substantial improvements in both prior art retrieval quality and computational efficiency."

relationships among the impact of book chapters indexed in the Book Citation
Index using information gain values and published by different academic
publishers in specific disciplines. The impact of book chapters can be
characterized statistically by citations histograms. For instance, we can
compute the probability of occurrence of book chapters with a number of
citations in different intervals for each academic publisher. We predict the
similarity between two citation histograms based on the amount of relative
information between such characterizations. We observe that the citation
patterns of book chapters follow a Lotkaian distribution. This paper describes
the structure of the Book Citation Index using 'heliocentric clockwise maps'
which allow the reader not only to determine the grade of similarity of a given
academic publisher indexed in the Book Citation Index with a specific
discipline according to their citation distribution, but also to easily observe
the general structure of a discipline, identifying the publishers with higher

their influence on academia has not been gauged. Here, we probe the impact of
questionable publications through a systematic and comprehensive analysis with
various participants from academia and compare the results with those of their
unaccused counterparts using billions of citation records, including liaisons,
i.e., journals and publishers, and prosumers, i.e., authors. Questionable
publications attribute publisher-level self-citations to their journals while
limiting journal-level self-citations; yet, conventional journal-level metrics
are unable to detect these publisher-level self-citations. We propose a hybrid
journal-publisher metric for detecting self-favouring citations among QJs from
publishers. Additionally, we demonstrate that the questionable publications
were less disruptive and influential than their counterparts. Our findings
indicate an inflated citation impact of suspicious academic publishers. The
findings provide a basis for actionable policy-making against questionable

Citation networks typically exhibit in-degree distributions well approximated by log-normal distributions yet also display power-law behaviour in the high-citation regime -- an apparent contradiction lacking a unified explanation. Here we identify a previously unrecognised phenomenon: the variance of the logarithm of citation counts per unit time follows a power law with respect to time ($t$) since publication, scaling as $t^{H}$, with $H$ constant. This discovery introduces a new challenge while simultaneously offering a crucial clue to resolving this discrepancy. We develop a stochastic model in which latent attention to publications evolves through a memory-driven process with cumulative advantage, modelled as fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $H$ and volatility. We show that antipersistent fluctuations in attention ($H < 1/2$) yield log-normal citation distributions, whereas persistent attention dynamics ($H > 1/2$) favour heavy-tailed power laws, thus resolving the log-normal--power-law contradiction. Numerical simulations confirm both the $t^{H}$ law and the transition between regimes. Empirical analysis of arXiv e-prints indicates that the latent attention process is intrinsically antipersistent ($H \approx 0.13$). By linking memory effects and stochastic fluctuations in attention to broader network dynamics, our findings provide a unifying framework for understanding the evolution of collective attention in science and other attention-driven processes."

However, existing graph learning approaches often struggle to generalize across domains. Motivated by recent advances in CV and NLP, cross-domain graph learning (CDGL) has gained renewed attention as a promising step toward realizing true graph foundation models. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review and analysis of existing works on CDGL. We propose a new taxonomy that categorizes existing approaches according to the type of transferable knowledge learned across domains: structure-oriented, feature-oriented, and mixture-oriented.

We introduce DeepTRACE, a novel sociotechnically grounded audit framework that turns prior community-identified failure cases into eight measurable dimensions spanning answer text, sources, and citations. DeepTRACE uses statement-level analysis (decomposition, confidence scoring) and builds citation and factual-support matrices to audit how systems reason with and attribute evidence end-to-end. Using automated extraction pipelines for popular public models (e.g., GPT-4.5/5, You.com, Perplexity, Copilot/Bing, Gemini) and an LLM-judge with validated agreement to human raters, we evaluate both web-search engines and deep-research configurations. Our findings show that generative search engines and deep research agents frequently produce one-sided, highly confident responses on debate queries and include large fractions of statements unsupported by their own listed sources. Deep-research configurations reduce overconfidence and can attain high citation thoroughness, but they remain highly one-sided on debate queries and still exhibit large fractions of unsupported statements, with citation accuracy ranging from 40--80% across systems."

ultimately determined by its downstream, real-world impact. Current objective
predictors of impact rest on proxy, reductive metrics of dissemination, such as
paper citation rates, whose relation to real-world translation remains
unquantified. Here we sought to determine the comparative predictability of
future real-world translation--as indexed by inclusion in patents, guidelines
or policy documents--from complex models of the abstract-level content of
biomedical publications versus citations and publication meta-data alone. We
develop a suite of representational and discriminative mathematical models of
multi-scale publication data, quantifying predictive performance out-of-sample,
ahead-of-time, across major biomedical domains, using the entire corpus of
biomedical research captured by Microsoft Academic Graph from 1990 to 2019,
encompassing 43.3 million papers across all domains. We show that citations are
only moderately predictive of translational impact as judged by inclusion in
patents, guidelines, or policy documents. By contrast, high-dimensional models
of publication titles, abstracts and metadata exhibit high fidelity (AUROC >
0.9), generalise across time and thematic domain, and transfer to the task of
recognising papers of Nobel Laureates. The translational impact of a paper
indexed by inclusion in patents, guidelines, or policy documents can be
predicted--out-of-sample and ahead-of-time--with substantially higher fidelity
from complex models of its abstract-level content than from models of
publication meta-data or citation metrics. We argue that content-based models
of impact are superior in performance to conventional, citation-based measures,
and sustain a stronger evidence-based claim to the objective measurement of
translational potential.

learning methods such as autoencoders (AE) extract effective clustering and
downstream representations but cannot incorporate rich structural information.
While Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have shown great success in encoding graph
structure, typical GNNs based on convolution or attention variants suffer from
over-smoothing, noise, heterophily, are computationally expensive and typically
require the complete graph being present. Instead, we propose Self-Supervised
Contrastive Graph Clustering (SCGC), which imposes graph-structure via
contrastive loss signals to learn discriminative node representations and
iteratively refined soft cluster labels. We also propose SCGC*, with a more
effective, novel, Influence Augmented Contrastive (IAC) loss to fuse richer
structural information, and half the original model parameters. SCGC(*) is
faster with simple linear units, completely eliminate convolutions and
attention of traditional GNNs, yet efficiently incorporates structure. It is
impervious to layer depth and robust to over-smoothing, incorrect edges and
heterophily. It is scalable by batching, a limitation in many prior GNN models,
and trivially parallelizable. We obtain significant improvements over
state-of-the-art on a wide range of benchmark graph datasets, including images,
sensor data, text, and citation networks efficiently. Specifically, 20% on ARI

analyze the relationships between impact factor, h-index, and g-index of a

generalized version of the impact factor where there is no time window. In the
absence of the time window, the impact factor converges to the number of
citations received per paper. This is not only justified for the impact factor,
it simplifies the analysis of h-index and g-index as well because addition of a
time window in the form of years complicates the computation of indices too. We
derive the expressions for the relationships among impact factor, h-index, and
g-index and validate them using a given set of publication-citation data.

outstanding performance in graph learning and node classification tasks.
However, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks, particularly through
susceptible nodes, poses a challenge in decision-making. The need for robust
graph summarization is evident in adversarial challenges resulting from the
propagation of attacks throughout the entire graph. In this paper, we address
both performance and adversarial robustness in graph input by introducing the
novel technique SHERD (Subgraph Learning Hale through Early Training
Representation Distances). SHERD leverages information from layers of a
partially trained graph convolutional network (GCN) to detect susceptible nodes
during adversarial attacks using standard distance metrics. The method
identifies ""vulnerable (bad)"" nodes and removes such nodes to form a robust
subgraph while maintaining node classification performance. Through our
experiments, we demonstrate the increased performance of SHERD in enhancing
robustness by comparing the network's performance on original and subgraph
inputs against various baselines alongside existing adversarial attacks. Our
experiments across multiple datasets, including citation datasets such as Cora,
Citeseer, and Pubmed, as well as microanatomical tissue structures of cell
graphs in the placenta, highlight that SHERD not only achieves substantial
improvement in robust performance but also outperforms several baselines in
terms of node classification accuracy and computational complexity.

the discovery of emerging technologies and for measuring the pulse of inventive
progress. Conventional methods for forecasting these forward citations cast the
problem as analysis of temporal point processes which rely on the conditional
intensity of previously received citations. Recent approaches model the
conditional intensity as a chain of recurrent neural networks to capture memory
dependency in hopes of reducing the restrictions of the parametric form of the
intensity function. For the problem of patent citations, we observe that
forecasting a patent's chain of citations benefits from not only the patent's
history itself but also from the historical citations of assignees and
inventors associated with that patent. In this paper, we propose a
sequence-to-sequence model which employs an attention-of-attention mechanism to
capture the dependencies of these multiple time sequences. Furthermore, the
proposed model is able to forecast both the timestamp and the category of a
patent's next citation. Extensive experiments on a large patent citation
dataset collected from USPTO demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms
state-of-the-art models at forward citation forecasting.

  Analysis",cs.IR cs.DL,"  The literature search has always been an important part of an academic
research. It greatly helps to improve the quality of the research process and
output, and increase the efficiency of the researchers in terms of their novel
contribution to science. As the number of published papers increases every
year, a manual search becomes more exhaustive even with the help of today's
search engines since they are not specialized for this task. In academics, two
relevant papers do not always have to share keywords, cite one another, or even
be in the same field. Although a well-known paper is usually an easy pray in
such a hunt, relevant papers using a different terminology, especially recent
ones, are not obvious to the eye.
  In this work, we propose paper recommendation algorithms by using the
citation information among papers. The proposed algorithms are direction aware
in the sense that they can be tuned to find either recent or traditional
papers. The algorithms require a set of papers as input and recommend a set of
related ones. If the user wants to give negative or positive feedback on the
suggested paper set, the recommendation is refined. The search process can be
easily guided in that sense by relevance feedback. We show that this slight
guidance helps the user to reach a desired paper in a more efficient way. We
adapt our models and algorithms also for the venue and reviewer recommendation
tasks. Accuracy of the models and algorithms is thoroughly evaluated by
comparison with multiple baselines and algorithms from the literature in terms

  citations for journal and conference papers",cs.DL,"  This study analyzed 16,799 journal papers and 98,773 conference papers
published by IEEE Xplore in 2016 to investigate the relationships among usage
counts, Mendeley readership, and citations through descriptive, regression, and
mediation analyses. Differences in the relationship among these metrics between
journal and conference papers are also studied. Results showed that there is no
significant difference between journal and conference papers in the
distribution patterns and accumulation rates of the three metrics. However, the
correlation coefficients of the interrelationships between the three metrics
were lower in conference papers compared to journal papers. Secondly, funding,
international collaboration, and open access are positively associated with all
three metrics, except for the case of funding on the usage metrics of
conference papers. Furthermore, early Mendeley readership is a better predictor
of citations than early usage counts and performs better for journal papers.
Finally, we reveal that early Mendeley readership partially mediates between
early usage counts and citation counts in the journal and conference papers.
The main difference is that conference papers rely more on the direct effect of
early usage counts on citations. This study contributes to expanding the
existing knowledge on the relationships among usage counts, Mendeley
readership, and citations in journal and conference papers, providing new
insights into the relationship between the three metrics through mediation
analysis.

gnn_citations,graph neural networks for citation analysis,628,2105.07264,0.663007,Neural Trees for Learning on Graphs,cs.LG cs.CV cs.RO,"  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a flexible and powerful approach
for learning over graphs. Despite this success, existing GNNs are constrained
by their local message-passing architecture and are provably limited in their
expressive power. In this work, we propose a new GNN architecture -- the Neural
Tree. The neural tree architecture does not perform message passing on the
input graph, but on a tree-structured graph, called the H-tree, that is
constructed from the input graph. Nodes in the H-tree correspond to subgraphs
in the input graph, and they are reorganized in a hierarchical manner such that
the parent of a node in the H-tree always corresponds to a larger subgraph in
the input graph. We show that the neural tree architecture can approximate any
smooth probability distribution function over an undirected graph. We also
prove that the number of parameters needed to achieve an
$\epsilon$-approximation of the distribution function is exponential in the
treewidth of the input graph, but linear in its size. We prove that any
continuous $\mathcal{G}$-invariant/equivariant function can be approximated by
a nonlinear combination of such probability distribution functions over
$\mathcal{G}$. We apply the neural tree to semi-supervised node classification
in 3D scene graphs, and show that these theoretical properties translate into
significant gains in prediction accuracy, over the more traditional GNN
architectures. We also show the applicability of the neural tree architecture
to citation networks with large treewidth, by using a graph sub-sampling
technique.

  Networks",cs.SI cs.DL physics.soc-ph,"  Extensive literature demonstrates how the copying of references (links) can
lead to the emergence of various structural properties (e.g., power-law degree
distribution and bipartite cores) in bibliographic and other similar directed
networks. However, it is also well known that the copying process is incapable
of mimicking the number of directed triangles in such networks; neither does it
have the power to explain the obsolescence of older papers. In this paper, we
propose RefOrCite, a new model that allows for copying of both the references
from (i.e., out-neighbors of) as well as the citations to (i.e., in-neighbors
of) an existing node. In contrast, the standard copying model (CP) only copies
references. While retaining its spirit, RefOrCite differs from the Forest Fire
(FF) model in ways that makes RefOrCite amenable to mean-field analysis for
degree distribution, triangle count, and densification. Empirically, RefOrCite
gives the best overall agreement with observed degree distribution, triangle
count, diameter, h-index, and the growth of citations to newer papers.

statistical uncertainties for neural network predictions but with a higher
computational overhead which can limit their practical usage. This work
explores the use of high performance computing with distributed training to
address the challenges of training BNNs at scale. We present a performance and
scalability comparison of training the VGG-16 and Resnet-18 models on a
Cray-XC40 cluster. We demonstrate that network pruning can speed up inference
without accuracy loss and provide an open source software package,
{\it{BPrune}} to automate this pruning. For certain models we find that pruning
up to 80\% of the network results in only a 7.0\% loss in accuracy. With the
development of new hardware accelerators for Deep Learning, BNNs are of
considerable interest for benchmarking performance. This analysis of training a
BNN at scale outlines the limitations and benefits compared to a conventional
neural network.

  areas of the Scopus database",cs.DL,"  The potential benefit of open access (OA) in relation to citation impact has
been discussed in the literature in depth. The methodology used to test the OA
citation advantage includes comparing OA vs. non-OA journal impact factors and
citations of OA versus non-OA articles published in the same non-OA journals.
However, one problem with many studies is that they are small -restricted to a
discipline or set of journals-. Moreover, conclusions are not entirely
consistent among research areas and 'early view' and 'selection bias' have been
suggested as possible explications. In the present paper, an analysis of gold
OA from across all areas of research -the 27 subject areas of the Scopus
database- is realized. As a novel contribution, this paper takes a
journal-level approach to assessing the OA citation advantage, whereas many
others take a paper-level approach. Data were obtained from Scimago Lab, sorted
using Scopus database, and tagged as OA/non-OA using the DOAJ list. Jointly
with the OA citation advantage, the OA prevalence as well as the differences
between access types (OA vs. non-OA) in production and referencing are tested.
A total of 3,737 OA journals (16.8%) and 18,485 non-OA journals (83.2%)
published in 2015 are considered. As the main conclusion, there is no
generalizable gold OA citation advantage at journal level.

gnn_citations,graph neural networks for citation analysis,634,1808.07541,0.66251504,Reproducible data citations for computational research,cs.DL,"  The general purpose of a scientific publication is the exchange and spread of
knowledge. A publication usually reports a scientific result and tries to
convince the reader that it is valid. With an ever-growing number of papers
relying on computational methods that make use of large quantities of data and
sophisticated statistical modeling techniques, a textual description of the
result is often not enough for a publication to be transparent and
reproducible. While there are efforts to encourage sharing of code and data, we
currently lack conventions for linking data sources to a computational result
that is stated in the main publication text or used to generate a figure or
table. Thus, here I propose a data citation format that allows for an automatic
reproduction of all computations. A data citation consists of a descriptor that
refers to the functional program code and the input that generated the result.
The input itself may be a set of other data citations, such that all data
transformations, from the original data sources to the final result, are
transparently expressed by a directed graph. Functions can be implemented in a
variety of programming languages since data sources are expected to be stored
in open and standardized text-based file formats. A publication is then an
online file repository consisting of a Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)
document and additional data and code source files, together with a
summarization of all data sources, similar to a list of references in a
bibliography.

editors being encouraged to provide citations for the added content. For a
Wikipedia article, determining the \emph{citation span} of a citation, i.e.
what content is covered by a citation, is important as it helps decide for
which content citations are still missing.
  We are the first to address the problem of determining the \emph{citation
span} in Wikipedia articles. We approach this problem by classifying which
textual fragments in an article are covered by a citation. We propose a
sequence classification approach where for a paragraph and a citation, we
determine the citation span at a fine-grained level.
  We provide a thorough experimental evaluation and compare our approach
against baselines adopted from the scientific domain, where we show improvement
for all evaluation metrics.

the United States Patent and Trademark Office in 1998. In contrast to previous

caused citation-number growth is controlled for. Our approach reveals an
intrinsic citation rate that clearly separates into an -- in the long run,
exponentially time-dependent -- ageing function and a completely
time-independent preferential-attachment-type growth kernel. For the general
case of such a separable citation rate, we obtain the time-dependent citation
distribution analytically in a form that is valid for any functional form of
its ageing and growth parts. Good agreement between theory and long-time
characteristics of patent-citation data establishes our work as a useful
framework for addressing still open questions about knowledge-propagation
dynamics, such as the observed excess of citations at short times.

Networks (HGNNs), since many real-world graphs are heterogeneous in nature,
from citation graphs to email graphs. However, existing methods ignore a tree
hierarchy among metapaths, naturally constituted by different node types and
relation types. In this paper, we present HetTree, a novel HGNN that models
both the graph structure and heterogeneous aspects in a scalable and effective
manner. Specifically, HetTree builds a semantic tree data structure to capture
the hierarchy among metapaths. To effectively encode the semantic tree, HetTree
uses a novel subtree attention mechanism to emphasize metapaths that are more
helpful in encoding parent-child relationships. Moreover, HetTree proposes
carefully matching pre-computed features and labels correspondingly,
constituting a complete metapath representation. Our evaluation of HetTree on a
variety of real-world datasets demonstrates that it outperforms all existing
baselines on open benchmarks and efficiently scales to large real-world graphs
with millions of nodes and edges.

divergence in training and in calibration, and we show how the use in
calibration provides better calibrated uncertainty estimates for specific
choices of alpha and is more efficient especially for complex network

An ablation study was conducted to evaluate the contribution of individual components in the ResE-BiLSTM architecture. Additionally, SHAP analysis was employed to interpret the underlying features the model relied upon for its predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that ResE-BiLSTM achieves superior predictive performance compared to baseline models, underscoring its practical value and applicability in real-world scenarios."

appropriate standardization must be applied as part of any bibliometric
analysis of the productivity of individual scientists and research

characterizes the distribution of the citations of articles from the same year

researchers' productivity rankings to the scaling factor chosen to standardize
their citations. To do this we first prepare the productivity rankings for all
researchers (more than 30,000) operating in the hard sciences in Italy, over
the period 2004-2008. We then measure the shifts in rankings caused by adopting
scaling factors other than the particular factor that seems more effective for
comparing the impact of publications in different fields: the citation average
of the distribution of cited-only publications.

It could be interlinked web data or citation networks of scientific publications. The essential problem for such a data type is to determine nodes that carry greater importance than all the others, a task that markedly enhances system monitoring and management. Traditional methods to identify important nodes in networks introduce centrality measures, such as node degree or more complex PageRank. However, they consider only the network structure, neglecting the rich node attributes. Recent methods adopt neural networks capable of handling node features, but they require supervision. This work addresses the identified gap--the absence of approaches that are both unsupervised and attribute-aware--by introducing a Pipeline for Important Node Exploration (PINE). At the core of the proposed framework is an attention-based graph model that incorporates node semantic features in the learning process of identifying the structural graph properties. The PINE's node importance scores leverage the obtained attention distribution. We demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed PINE method on various homogeneous and heterogeneous attributed networks. As an industry-implemented system, PINE tackles the real-world challenge of unsupervised identification of key entities within large-scale enterprise graphs."

characterize many real-world applications such as citation and events networks,
recommender systems, and knowledge graphs. Although different Graph Neural

only support homogeneous graphs or suffer from model design heavily influenced
by specific THNs prediction tasks. Furthermore, there is a lack of temporal
heterogeneous networked data in current standard graph benchmark datasets.
Hence, in this work, we propose DURENDAL, a graph deep learning framework for
THNs. DURENDAL can help to easily repurpose any heterogeneous graph learning
model to evolving networks by combining design principles from snapshot-based
and multirelational message-passing graph learning models. We introduce two
different schemes to update embedding representations for THNs, discussing the
strengths and weaknesses of both strategies. We also extend the set of
benchmarks for TNHs by introducing two novel high-resolution temporal
heterogeneous graph datasets derived from an emerging Web3 platform and a
well-established e-commerce website. Overall, we conducted the experimental
evaluation of the framework over four temporal heterogeneous network datasets
on future link prediction tasks in an evaluation setting that takes into

evidence shows that adopting Open Science practices has effects in several
domains. In this study, we investigate whether adopting one or more Open

as Open Science Indicators, produced by PLOS and DataSeer, which includes all
PLOS publications from 2018 to 2023 as well as a comparison group sampled from
the PMC Open Access Subset. In total, we analyze circa 122'000 publications. We
calculate publication and author-level citation indicators and use a broad set
of control variables to isolate the effect of Open Science Indicators on
received citations. We show that Open Science practices are adopted to
different degrees across scientific disciplines. We find that the early release
of a publication as a preprint correlates with a significant positive citation
advantage of about 20.2% on average. We also find that sharing data in an
online repository correlates with a smaller yet still positive citation
advantage of 4.3% on average. However, we do not find a significant citation
advantage for sharing code. Further research is needed on additional or
alternative measures of impact beyond citations. Our results are likely to be

To address these shortcomings, we propose \textbf{SurveyG}, an LLM-based agent framework that integrates \textit{hierarchical citation graph}, where nodes denote research papers and edges capture both citation dependencies and semantic relatedness between their contents, thereby embedding structural and contextual knowledge into the survey generation process. The graph is organized into three layers: \textbf{Foundation}, \textbf{Development}, and \textbf{Frontier}, to capture the evolution of research from seminal works to incremental advances and emerging directions. By combining horizontal search within layers and vertical depth traversal across layers, the agent produces multi-level summaries, which are consolidated into a structured survey outline. A multi-agent validation stage then ensures consistency, coverage, and factual accuracy in generating the final survey. Experiments, including evaluations by human experts and LLM-as-a-judge, demonstrate that SurveyG outperforms state-of-the-art frameworks, producing surveys that are more comprehensive and better structured to the underlying knowledge taxonomy of a field."

from training sampling-based GNNs on small samples of a large input graph are
within an $\epsilon$-neighborhood of the outcome of training the same
architecture on the whole graph. We derive bounds on the number of samples, the
size of the graph, and the training steps required as a function of $\epsilon$.
Our results give a novel theoretical understanding for using sampling in
training GNNs. They also suggest that by training GNNs on small samples of the
input graph, practitioners can identify and select the best models,
hyperparameters, and sampling algorithms more efficiently. We empirically
illustrate our results on a node classification task on large citation graphs,
observing that sampling-based GNNs trained on local subgraphs 12$\times$
smaller than the original graph achieve comparable performance to those trained
on the input graph.

  Neural Networks",cs.AR cs.AI cs.LG,"  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently gained attention due to their
performance on non-Euclidean data. The use of custom hardware architectures
proves particularly beneficial for GNNs due to their irregular memory access
patterns, resulting from the sparse structure of graphs. However, existing FPGA
accelerators are limited by their double buffering mechanism, which doesn't
account for the irregular node distribution in typical graph datasets. To
address this, we introduce \textbf{AMPLE} (Accelerated Message Passing Logic
Engine), an FPGA accelerator leveraging a new event-driven programming flow. We
develop a mixed-arithmetic architecture, enabling GNN inference to be quantized
at a node-level granularity. Finally, prefetcher for data and instructions is
implemented to optimize off-chip memory access and maximize node parallelism.
Evaluation on citation and social media graph datasets ranging from $2$K to
$700$K nodes showed a mean speedup of $243\times$ and $7.2\times$ against CPU

citation pattern followed in a particular discipline. We define the citation
pattern in a discipline by three factors. The average number of references per
article, the probability of citing an article based on its age and the number
of citations it already has. We also consider the average number of articles
published per year in the discipline. We propose that the probability of citing
an article based on its age can be modeled by a lifetime distribution. The
lifetime distribution models the citation lifetime of an average article in a
particular discipline. We find that the citation lifetime distribution in a
particular discipline predicts the topological structure of the citation
network in that discipline. We show that the power law exponent depends on the
three factors that define the citation pattern. Finally we fit the data from
the Physical Review D journal to obtain the citation pattern and calculate the
total degree distribution for the citation network.

generating text with citations. However, existing tasks and evaluation methods
are predominantly limited to sentence-level statement, neglecting the
significance of positional fine-grained citations that can appear anywhere
within sentences. To facilitate further exploration of the fine-grained
citation generation, we propose ALiiCE, the first automatic evaluation
framework for this task. Our framework first parses the sentence claim into
atomic claims via dependency analysis and then calculates citation quality at
the atomic claim level. ALiiCE introduces three novel metrics for positional
fined-grained citation quality assessment, including positional fine-grained
citation recall and precision, and coefficient of variation of citation
positions. We evaluate the positional fine-grained citation generation
performance of several LLMs on two long-form QA datasets. Our experiments and
analyses demonstrate the effectiveness and reasonableness of ALiiCE. The
results also indicate that existing LLMs still struggle to provide positional
fine-grained citations.

the rotated solution a model is assumed. This assumption can be legitimated on
pragmatic or theoretical grounds. Since the resulting outcomes remain sensitive
to the assumptions in the model, an unambiguous classification is no longer

Foreign co-funding as well as international co-authorship and co-affiliations are consistently associated with higher citation impact. In particular, foreign co-affiliations are associated with higher field-normalised citation impact (FNCI) for MESU-funded articles in 2022-2023, exceeding that of articles jointly funded by MESU and foreign agencies. NASU funding is associated with only modest differences in citation impact relative to unfunded articles. These effects are small and not consistently significant across authorship patterns and become less pronounced in 2022-2023, as the citation impact of unfunded articles partially converges with that of funded articles.

applications ranging from social network analysis to biology. How to correctly
and effectively learn and extract information from graph is essential for a
large number of machine learning tasks. Graph embedding is a way to transform
and encode the data structure in high dimensional and non-Euclidean feature
space to a low dimensional and structural space, which is easily exploited by
other machine learning algorithms. We have witnessed a huge surge of such
embedding methods, from statistical approaches to recent deep learning methods
such as the graph convolutional networks (GCN). Deep learning approaches
usually outperform the traditional methods in most graph learning benchmarks by
building an end-to-end learning framework to optimize the loss function
directly. However, most of the existing GCN methods can only perform
convolution operations with node features, while ignoring the handy information
in edge features, such as relations in knowledge graphs. To address this
problem, we present CensNet, Convolution with Edge-Node Switching graph neural
network, for learning tasks in graph-structured data with both node and edge
features. CensNet is a general graph embedding framework, which embeds both
nodes and edges to a latent feature space. By using line graph of the original
undirected graph, the role of nodes and edges are switched, and two novel graph
convolution operations are proposed for feature propagation. Experimental
results on real-world academic citation networks and quantum chemistry graphs
show that our approach achieves or matches the state-of-the-art performance in
four graph learning tasks, including semi-supervised node classification,
multi-task graph classification, graph regression, and link prediction.

research papers. Researchers devote time and effort to search relevant
manuscripts when writing a paper or simply to keep up with current research. In
this paper, we consider the problem of citation recommendation by extending a
set of known-to-be-relevant references. Our analysis shows the degrees of cited
papers in the subgraph induced by the citations of a paper, called projection
graph, follow a power law distribution. Existing popular methods are only good
at finding the long tail papers, the ones that are highly connected to others.
In other words, the majority of cited papers are loosely connected in the
projection graph but they are not going to be found by existing methods. To
address this problem, we propose to combine author, venue and keyword
information to interpret the citation behavior behind those loosely connected
papers. Results show that different methods are finding cited papers with
widely different properties. We suggest multiple recommended lists by different
algorithms could satisfy various users for a real citation recommendation
system. Moreover, we also explore the fast local approximation for combined

  Temporal Evolving Graphs",cs.LG cs.AI,"  Conventional time series classification approaches based on bags of patterns
or shapelets face significant challenges in dealing with a vast amount of
feature candidates from high-dimensional multivariate data. In contrast, deep
neural networks can learn low-dimensional features efficiently, and in
particular, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have shown promising results in
classifying Multivariate Time Series (MTS) data. A key factor in the success of
deep neural networks is this astonishing expressive power. However, this power
comes at the cost of complex, black-boxed models, conflicting with the goals of
building reliable and human-understandable models. An essential criterion in
understanding such predictive deep models involves quantifying the contribution
of time-varying input variables to the classification. Hence, in this work, we
introduce a new framework for interpreting multivariate time series data by
extracting and clustering the input representative patterns that highly
activate CNN neurons. This way, we identify each signal's role and
dependencies, considering all possible combinations of signals in the MTS
input. Then, we construct a graph that captures the temporal relationship
between the extracted patterns for each layer. An effective graph merging
strategy finds the connection of each node to the previous layer's nodes.
Finally, a graph embedding algorithm generates new representations of the
created interpretable time-series features. To evaluate the performance of our
proposed framework, we run extensive experiments on eight datasets of the
UCR/UEA archive, along with HAR and PAM datasets. The experiments indicate the
benefit of our time-aware graph-based representation in MTS classification
while enriching them with more interpretability.

modularity optimization, and one based on eigenvector centrality. Using the
network of citations between opinions of the United States Supreme Court as an
example, we demonstrate how each of these methods can reveal significant
structural divisions in the network, and how, ultimately, the combination of
all three can help us develop a coherent overall picture of the network's

particular with respect to conventional neighborhoods, alternative aggregation
strategies have recently been investigated. This paper investigates graph
structure in message passing, aimed to incorporate topological characteristics.
While the simplicity of neighborhoods remains alluring, we propose a novel
perspective by introducing the concept of 'cover' as a generalization of
neighborhoods. We design the Grothendieck Graph Neural Networks (GGNN)
framework, offering an algebraic platform for creating and refining diverse
covers for graphs. This framework translates covers into matrix forms, such as
the adjacency matrix, expanding the scope of designing GNN models based on
desired message-passing strategies. Leveraging algebraic tools, GGNN
facilitates the creation of models that outperform traditional approaches.
Based on the GGNN framework, we propose Sieve Neural Networks (SNN), a new GNN
model that leverages the notion of sieves from category theory. SNN
demonstrates outstanding performance in experiments, particularly on benchmarks
designed to test the expressivity of GNNs, and exemplifies the versatility of

Since argumentative zoning is to identify the argumentative and rhetorical

the citation recommendation task. In this paper, a multi-task learning model is
built for citation recommendation and argumentative zoning classification. We
also generated an annotated corpus of the data from PubMed Central based on a
new argumentative zoning schema. The experimental results show that, by
considering the argumentative information in the citing sentence, citation

linkage has been growing exponentially over a long period of time, doubling
every 2.9 years. The U.S. has been the largest producer of cited science for
years, receiving nearly half of the citations. More than half of citations goes
to universities. We use a new paper-level indicator to quantify to what extent
a paper is basic research or clinical medicine. We find that the cited papers
are likely to be basic research, yet a significant portion of papers cited in
patents that are related to FDA-approved drugs are clinical research. The U.S.
National Institute of Health continues to be an important funder of cited

learn generalizable representations for downstream tasks. In the graph domain,
however, capturing and transferring structural information across different
graph domains remains challenging, primarily due to the inherent differences in
topological patterns across various contexts. Additionally, most existing
models struggle to capture the complexity of rich graph structures, leading to
inadequate exploration of the embedding space. To address these challenges, we
propose GFSE, a universal graph structural encoder designed to capture
transferable structural patterns across diverse domains such as molecular
graphs, social networks, and citation networks. GFSE is the first cross-domain
graph structural encoder pre-trained with multiple self-supervised learning
objectives. Built on a Graph Transformer, GFSE incorporates attention
mechanisms informed by graph inductive bias, enabling it to encode intricate
multi-level and fine-grained topological features. The pre-trained GFSE
produces generic and theoretically expressive positional and structural
encoding for graphs, which can be seamlessly integrated with various downstream
graph feature encoders, including graph neural networks for vectorized features
and Large Language Models for text-attributed graphs. Comprehensive experiments
on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate GFSE's capability to
significantly enhance the model's performance while requiring substantially
less task-specific fine-tuning. Notably, GFSE achieves state-of-the-art
performance in 81.6% evaluated cases, spanning diverse graph models and
datasets, highlighting its potential as a powerful and versatile encoder for
graph-structured data.

men's. The informetric and scientometric community has briefly examined
gender-based inequalities in online visibility. However, the link between

visibility is helping women overcome the gender-based citation penalty. Our
analyses cover the three broad research areas of Computer Science, Engineering,
and Social Sciences, which have different gender representation, adoption of
online science dissemination practices, and citation culture. We create a
quasi-experimental setting by applying Coarsened Exact Matching, which enables
us to isolate the effects of team gender composition and online visibility on

Existing methods manually construct or learn one fixed graph for all the layers

different layers, we propose dynamic learning of graphs and node features
jointly in GCNNs. In particular, we cast the graph optimization problem as
distance metric learning to capture pairwise similarities of features in each
layer. We deploy the Mahalanobis distance metric and further decompose the
metric matrix into a low-dimensional matrix, which converts graph learning to
the optimization of a low-dimensional matrix for efficient implementation.
Extensive experiments on point clouds and citation network datasets demonstrate
the superiority of the proposed method in terms of both accuracies and
robustness.

operates in a way that does not maintain coverage stability: documents that
stop being available to Google Scholar's crawlers are removed from the system.
This can also affect Google Scholar's citation graph (citation counts can
decrease). Furthermore, because Google Scholar is not transparent about its
coverage, the only way to directly observe coverage loss is through regular
monitorization of Google Scholar data. Because of this, few studies have
empirically documented this phenomenon. This study analyses a large decrease in
coverage of documents in the field of Astronomy and Astrophysics that took
place in 2019 and its subsequent recovery, using longitudinal data from
previous analyses and a new dataset extracted in 2020. Documents from most of
the larger publishers in the field disappeared from Google Scholar despite
continuing to be available on the Web, which suggests an error on Google
Scholar's side. Disappeared documents did not reappear until the following
index-wide update, many months after the problem was discovered. The slowness
with which Google Scholar is currently able to resolve indexing errors is a
clear limitation of the platform both for literature search and bibliometric
use cases.

  Law",cs.CL cs.DL,"  Citing legal opinions is a key part of legal argumentation, an expert task
that requires retrieval, extraction and summarization of information from court
decisions. The identification of legally salient parts in an opinion for the
purpose of citation may be seen as a domain-specific formulation of a highlight
extraction or passage retrieval task. As similar tasks in other domains such as
web search show significant attention and improvement, progress in the legal
domain is hindered by the lack of resources for training and evaluation.
  This paper presents a new dataset that consists of the citation graph of
court opinions, which cite previously published court opinions in support of
their arguments. In particular, we focus on the verbatim quotes, i.e., where
the text of the original opinion is directly reused.
  With this approach, we explain the relative importance of different text
spans of a court opinion by showcasing their usage in citations, and measuring
their contribution to the relations between opinions in the citation graph.
  We release VerbCL, a large-scale dataset derived from CourtListener and
introduce the task of highlight extraction as a single-document summarization
task based on the citation graph establishing the first baseline results for
this task on the VerbCL dataset.

Relational Bayesian Networks (RBNs), in contrast, enable fully generative probabilistic modeling over graph-like structures and support rich symbolic knowledge and probabilistic inference. This paper presents a neuro-symbolic framework that seamlessly integrates GNNs into RBNs, combining the learning strength of GNNs with the flexible reasoning capabilities of RBNs.
  We develop two implementations of this integration: one compiles GNNs directly into the native RBN language, while the other maintains the GNN as an external component. Both approaches preserve the semantics and computational properties of GNNs while fully aligning with the RBN modeling paradigm. We also propose a maximum a-posteriori (MAP) inference method for these neuro-symbolic models.
  To demonstrate the framework's versatility, we apply it to two distinct problems. First, we transform a GNN for node classification into a collective classification model that explicitly models homo- and heterophilic label patterns, substantially improving accuracy. Second, we introduce a multi-objective network optimization problem in environmental planning, where MAP inference supports complex decision-making. Both applications include new publicly available benchmark datasets.
  This work introduces a powerful and coherent neuro-symbolic approach to graph data, bridging learning and reasoning in ways that enable novel applications and improved performance across diverse tasks."

data well, one which generates power laws and one which generates a stretched
exponential. It is not possible to discriminate between these models on the
present empirical basis. A consideration of citation distribution by subfield
shows that the citation patterns of high energy physics form a remarkably
homogeneous network. Further, we utilize the knowledge of the citation

  analysis",cs.DL,"  Unlike traditional citation analysis -- which assumes that all citations in a
paper are equivalent -- citation context analysis considers the contextual
information of individual citations. However, citation context analysis
requires creating large amounts of data through annotation, which hinders the
widespread use of this methodology. This study explored the applicability of
Large Language Models (LLMs) -- particularly ChatGPT -- to citation context
analysis by comparing LLMs and human annotation results. The results show that
the LLMs annotation is as good as or better than the human annotation in terms
of consistency but poor in terms of predictive performance. Thus, having LLMs
immediately replace human annotators in citation context analysis is
inappropriate. However, the annotation results obtained by LLMs can be used as
reference information when narrowing the annotation results obtained by
multiple human annotators to one, or LLMs can be used as one of the annotators
when it is difficult to prepare sufficient human annotators. This study
provides basic findings important for the future development of citation

properties of a given graph in the sampled graph. In this study, we provide a
comprehensive empirical characterization of five graph sampling algorithms on
six properties of a graph including degree, clustering coefficient, path
length, global clustering coefficient, assortativity, and modularity. We
extract samples from fifteen graphs grouped into five categories including
collaboration, social, citation, technological, and synthetic graphs. We
provide both qualitative and quantitative results. We find that there is no

(ConvNets), where filters are defined as elementwise multiplication in the
frequency domain of a graph. In machine learning settings where the dataset
consists of signals defined on many different graphs, the trained ConvNet
should generalize to signals on graphs unseen in the training set. It is thus
important to transfer ConvNets between graphs. Transferability, which is a
certain type of generalization capability, can be loosely defined as follows:
if two graphs describe the same phenomenon, then a single filter or ConvNet
should have similar repercussions on both graphs. This paper aims at debunking
the common misconception that spectral filters are not transferable. We show
that if two graphs discretize the same ""continuous"" space, then a spectral
filter or ConvNet has approximately the same repercussion on both graphs. Our
analysis is more permissive than the standard analysis. Transferability is
typically described as the robustness of the filter to small graph
perturbations and re-indexing of the vertices. Our analysis accounts also for
large graph perturbations. We prove transferability between graphs that can
have completely different dimensions and topologies, only requiring that both
graphs discretize the same underlying space in some generic sense.

study is to find the association among the authors' collaboration, the number
of retracted papers, the number of retracted citations, journal impact factor,
and research areas. We present a detailed analysis of 12231 research papers
indexed by Web of Science (WoS) as retracted publications from 1981-2020. The
study demonstrates the collaboration patterns of retracted publications where
61.5% of authors have only one and 24.6% have two retracted papers; however, 2%
of authors have more than 10 retracted papers. To study the impact of citing
retracted papers, we investigated the retracted papers with citations. The
study reveals that 55.2% of retracted papers have been cited at least once,
where 25.4% of papers are such papers where at least one citation turned out to
be a retraction. This shows the impact of scientific misconduct or fraud on new
research. The number of retractions is independent of the journal impact factor
and as compared to high impact papers, low impact papers are attracting more
citations. We also investigate the citations received by retracted papers
published in higher as well as lower impact factor journals. 1/4th of the
papers are retracted citations that cited the retracted papers; however, there
is no significant relationship exists between the higher impact or lower impact
journals with retractions or citations. Finally, how the average team size and
average retracted citations vary among different research areas are studied.
The study provides an insight that how a fraud leads to another fraud in the

the field of financial fraud detection by synergistically combining the
advantages of graph neural networks (gnn), convolutional neural networks (cnn)
and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. This convergence enables
multifaceted analysis of complex transaction patterns, improving detection
accuracy and resilience against complex fraudulent activities. A key novelty of
this paper is the use of multilayer perceptrons (MLPS) to estimate node
similarity, effectively filtering out neighborhood noise that can lead to false
positives. This intelligent purification mechanism ensures that only the most
relevant information is considered, thereby improving the model's understanding
of the network structure. Feature weakening often plagues graph-based models
due to the dilution of key signals. In order to further address the challenge
of feature weakening, GNN-CL adopts reinforcement learning strategies. By
dynamically adjusting the weights assigned to central nodes, it reinforces the
importance of these influential entities to retain important clues of fraud
even in less informative data. Experimental evaluations on Yelp datasets show
that the results highlight the superior performance of GNN-CL compared to

  journal",cs.DL stat.AP,"  How do the level of usage of an article, the timeframe of its usage and its
subject area relate to the number of citations it accrues? This paper aims to
answer this question through an observational study of usage and citation data
collected about the multidisciplinary, open access mega-journal Scientific
Reports. This observational study answers these questions using the following
methods: an overlap analysis of most read and top-cited articles; Spearman
correlation tests between total citation counts over two years and usage over
various timeframes; a comparison of first months of citation for most read and
all articles; a Wilcoxon test on the distribution of total citations of early
cited articles and the distribution of total citations of all other articles.
All analyses were performed using the programming language R. As Scientific
Reports is a multidisciplinary journal covering all natural and clinical
sciences, we also looked at the differences across subjects. We found a
moderate correlation between usage in the first year and citations in the first
two years since publication, and that articles with high usage in the first 6
months are more likely to have their first citation earlier (Wilcoxon=1811500,
p < 0.0001), which is also related to higher citations in the first two years
(Wilcoxon=8071200, p < 0.0001). As this final assertion is inferred based on
the results of the other elements of this paper, it requires further analysis.
Moreover, our choice of a 2 year window for our analysis did not consider the
articles' citation half-life, and our use of Scientific Reports (a journal that
is atypical compared to most academic journals) as the source of the articles
analysed has likely played a role in our findings, and so analysing a longer
timeframe and carrying out similar analysis on a different journal (or group of
journals) may lead to different conclusions.

semi-supervised learning of numerous web applications, such as classification
on web services and pages, analysis of online social networks, and
recommendation in e-commerce. The state of the art derives representations for
all nodes in graphs following the same diffusion (message passing) model
without discriminating their uniqueness. However, (i) labeled nodes involved in
model training usually account for a small portion of graphs in the
semisupervised setting, and (ii) different nodes locate at different graph
local contexts and it inevitably degrades the representation qualities if
treating them undistinguishedly in diffusion.
  To address the above issues, we develop NDM, a universal node-wise diffusion
model, to capture the unique characteristics of each node in diffusion, by
which NDM is able to yield high-quality node representations. In what follows,
we customize NDM for semisupervised learning and design the NIGCN model. In
particular, NIGCN advances the efficiency significantly since it (i) produces
representations for labeled nodes only and (ii) adopts well-designed neighbor
sampling techniques tailored for node representation generation. Extensive
experimental results on various types of web datasets, including citation,
social and co-purchasing graphs, not only verify the state-of-the-art
effectiveness of NIGCN but also strongly support the remarkable scalability of
NIGCN. In particular, NIGCN completes representation generation and training
within 10 seconds on the dataset with hundreds of millions of nodes and
billions of edges, up to orders of magnitude speedups over the baselines, while
achieving the highest F1-scores on classification.

signals represented in two different ways: concatenation of the channels of the
frequency bands and an image-like 2D representation of the EEG channel
locations. Performance of these models is examined on two tasks, social anxiety
disorder (SAD) detection, and emotion recognition using a dataset for emotion
analysis using physiological signals (DEAP). We hypothesized that model 2 will
significantly outperform model 1 and this was validated in our results as model
2 yielded $5$--$8\%$ higher accuracy in all machine learning algorithms
investigated. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) provided the best performance
far exceeding that of Support Vector Machine (SVM) and k-Nearest Neighbors

Contextualized Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (CG-RAG), a novel framework
that integrates sparse and dense retrieval signals within graph structures to

Lexical-Semantic Graph Retrieval (LeSeGR), which seamlessly integrates sparse

lexical precision and semantic understanding in citation graph retrieval,
demonstrating generalizability to existing graph retrieval and hybrid retrieval
methods. Finally, we present a context-aware generation strategy that utilizes
the retrieved graph-structured information to generate precise and contextually

research question answering benchmarks across multiple domains demonstrate that
our CG-RAG framework significantly outperforms RAG methods combined with

(HLS) are dependent on research in the engineering and physical sciences (EPS),
particularly physics, chemistry, mathematics, and engineering. The analysis
combines two different bibliometric approaches. The first approach to analyze
the 'EPS-HLS interface' is based on term map visualizations of HLS research
fields. We consider 16 clinical fields and five life science fields. On the
basis of expert judgment, EPS research in these fields is studied by
identifying EPS-related terms in the term maps. In the second approach, a
large-scale citation-based network analysis is applied to publications from all
fields of science. We work with about 22,000 clusters of publications, each
representing a topic in the scientific literature. Citation relations are used
to identify topics at the EPS-HLS interface. The two approaches complement each
other. The advantages of working with textual data compensate for the
limitations of working with citation relations and the other way around. An
important advantage of working with textual data is in the in-depth qualitative
insights it provides. Working with citation relations, on the other hand,
yields many relevant quantitative statistics. We find that EPS research
contributes to HLS developments mainly in the following five ways: new
materials and their properties; chemical methods for analysis and molecular
synthesis; imaging of parts of the body as well as of biomaterial surfaces;
medical engineering mainly related to imaging, radiation therapy, signal
processing technology, and other medical instrumentation; mathematical and
statistical methods for data analysis. In our analysis, about 10% of all EPS

percentage has remained more or less constant during the past decade.

Namely, that papers published in different years have varying citation potential. Hence, strictly speaking, their citations cannot be compared. In a former study, we created a new indicator called the internal rhythm indicator of an actor. The internal rhythm indicator makes it possible to compare the citation performances among different publication years, but it is only valid within the actor based framework. In this study, we define, create, and explore the external rhythm of an actor, which is also a sequence of ratios of observed citations to expected citations. The essential difference between internal rhythm and external rhythm lies in the way they are created and hence in the point of view taken to study an actor. The former is created based on its own publication-citation matrix, while the latter is based on two publication-citation matrices. One is the same as the former. The other one is a publication-citation matrix of a collective, which includes the actor under study. The external rhythm of an actor is a citation-based indicator of research that can be used to compare not only the citation performance of an actor with that of the collective the actor is part of, but also to compare two or more actors within the same collective. We further propose a summary average of ratios indicator."

generalizes known stability properties of graph filters and GNNs and it is also
a generalization of known stability properties of standard convolutional
filters and neural networks in continuous time. The most important observation
that follows from this analysis is that manifold filters, same as graph filters
and standard continuous time filters, have difficulty discriminating high
frequency components in the presence of deformations. This is a challenge that
can be ameliorated with the use of manifold, graph, or continuous time neural
networks. The most important practical consequence of this analysis is to shed
light on the behavior of graph filters and GNNs in large-scale graphs.

This phenomenon arises from LLMs' working memory constraints, which result in their inability to retain long-range graph topology over extended contexts while sustaining coherent multi-step reasoning. However, real-world graphs are often structurally complex, such as Web, Transportation, Social, and Citation networks. To address these limitations, we propose GraphCogent, a collaborative agent framework inspired by human Working Memory Model that decomposes graph reasoning into specialized cognitive processes: sense, buffer, and execute. The framework consists of three modules: Sensory Module standardizes diverse graph text representations via subgraph sampling, Buffer Module integrates and indexes graph data across multiple formats, and Execution Module combines tool calling and tool creation for efficient reasoning. We also introduce Graph4real, a comprehensive benchmark that contains four domains of real-world graphs (Web, Transportation, Social, and Citation) to evaluate LLMs' graph reasoning capabilities. Our Graph4real covers 21 different graph reasoning tasks, categorized into three types (Structural Querying, Algorithmic Reasoning, and Predictive Modeling tasks), with graph scales up to 10 times larger than existing benchmarks. Experiments show that Llama3.1-8B based GraphCogent achieves a 50% improvement over massive-scale LLMs like DeepSeek-R1 (671B). Compared to state-of-the-art agent-based baseline, our framework outperforms by 20% in accuracy while reducing token usage by 80% for in-toolset tasks and 30% for out-toolset tasks. Code will be available after review."

retrieval techniques based on full text search can be inaccurate to identify
main topics and they are not able to provide an indication about the importance
of the article. Generating a citation network is a good way to find most
popular articles but this approach is not context aware.
  The text around a citation mark is generally a good summary of the referred
article. So citation context analysis presents an opportunity to use the wisdom
of crowd for detecting important articles in a context sensitive way. In this
work, we analyze citation contexts to rank articles properly for a given topic.
The model proposed uses citation contexts in order to create a directed and
weighted citation network based on the target topic. We create a directed and
weighted edge between two articles if citation context contains terms related
with the target topic. Then we apply common ranking algorithms in order to find
important articles in this newly created network. We showed that this method
successfully detects a good subset of most prominent articles in a given topic.
The biggest contribution of this approach is that we are able to identify
important articles for a given search term even though these articles do not
contain this search term. This technique can be used in other linked documents
including web pages, legal documents, and patents.

directly map or translate a query, which is typically a claim or an entity
mention, to citation-worthy research papers. Within such a formulation, it is
challenging to pinpoint why one should cite a specific research paper for a
particular query, leading to limited recommendation interpretability. To
alleviate this, we introduce the evidence-grounded local citation
recommendation task, where the target latent space comprises evidence spans for
recommending specific papers. Using a distantly-supervised evidence retrieval
and multi-step re-ranking framework, our proposed system, ILCiteR, recommends
papers to cite for a query grounded on similar evidence spans extracted from
the existing research literature. Unlike past formulations that simply output
recommendations, ILCiteR retrieves ranked lists of evidence span and
recommended paper pairs. Secondly, previously proposed neural models for
citation recommendation require expensive training on massive labeled data,
ideally after every significant update to the pool of candidate papers. In
contrast, ILCiteR relies solely on distant supervision from a dynamic evidence
database and pre-trained Transformer-based Language Models without any model
training. We contribute a novel dataset for the evidence-grounded local
citation recommendation task and demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed
conditional neural rank-ensembling approach for re-ranking evidence spans.

promoting the idea of software citation to developers and users; collaborating

ensuring that the rest of the scholarly infrastructure, particularly indexing

neural networks (GNNs), various sparse learning techniques have been exploited
to reduce memory and storage costs. Examples include \textit{graph
sparsification} that samples a subgraph to reduce the amount of data
aggregation and \textit{model sparsification} that prunes the neural network to
reduce the number of trainable weights. Despite the empirical successes in
reducing the training cost while maintaining the test accuracy, the theoretical
generalization analysis of sparse learning for GNNs remains elusive. To the
best of our knowledge, this paper provides the first theoretical
characterization of joint edge-model sparse learning from the perspective of
sample complexity and convergence rate in achieving zero generalization error.
It proves analytically that both sampling important nodes and pruning neurons
with the lowest-magnitude can reduce the sample complexity and improve
convergence without compromising the test accuracy. Although the analysis is
centered on two-layer GNNs with structural constraints on data, the insights
are applicable to more general setups and justified by both synthetic and

allowed to merge articles; this may affect the H-index. We analyze the
(parameterized) computational complexity of maximizing the H-index using

compatibility graph whose edges correspond to plausible merges. Moreover, we
consider several different measures for computing the citation count of a
merged article. For the measure used by Google Scholar, we give an algorithm
that maximizes the H-index in linear time if the compatibility graph has
constant-size connected components. In contrast, if we allow to merge arbitrary
articles (that is, for compatibility graphs that are cliques), then already
increasing the H-index by one is NP-hard. Experiments on Google Scholar
profiles of AI researchers show that the H-index can be manipulated
substantially only if one merges articles with highly dissimilar titles.

from the research on web mining and information networks. Recent literature on
this topic has reached a consensus that node contents and link structures
should be integrated for reliable graph clustering, especially in an
unsupervised setting. However, existing methods based on shallow models often
suffer from content noise and sparsity. In this work, we propose to utilize
deep embedding for graph clustering, motivated by the well-recognized power of
neural networks in learning intrinsic content representations. Upon that, we
capture the dynamic nature of networks through the principle of influence
propagation and calculate the dynamic network embedding. Network clusters are
then detected based on the stable state of such an embedding. Unlike most
existing embedding methods that are task-agnostic, we simultaneously solve for
the underlying node representations and the optimal clustering assignments in
an end-to-end manner. To provide more insight, we theoretically analyze our
interpretation of network clusters and find its underlying connections with two
widely applied approaches for network modeling. Extensive experimental results
on six real-world datasets including both social networks and citation networks
demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model over the state-of-the-art.

excluding qualitative aspects such as sentiment and intent. However,
qualitative aspects provide deeper insights into the impact of a scientific
research artifact and make it possible to focus on relevant literature free
from bias associated with quantitative aspects. Therefore, it is possible to
rank and categorize papers based on their sentiment and intent. For this
purpose, larger citation sentiment datasets are required. However, from a time
and cost perspective, curating a large citation sentiment dataset is a
challenging task. Particularly, citation sentiment analysis suffers from both
data scarcity and tremendous costs for dataset annotation. To overcome the
bottleneck of data scarcity in the citation analysis domain we explore the
impact of out-domain data during training to enhance the model performance. Our
results emphasize the use of different scheduling methods based on the use
case. We empirically found that a model trained using sequential data
scheduling is more suitable for domain-specific usecases. Conversely, shuffled
data feeding achieves better performance on a cross-domain task. Based on our
findings, we propose an end-to-end trainable multi-task model that covers the
sentiment and intent analysis that utilizes out-domain datasets to overcome the
data scarcity.

  Compared to citation information, access logs have the advantage of being
immediately available, without manual or automatic extraction of the citation

can serve as a replacement for explicit meta-data, which potentially might be
expensive or completely unavailable. Therefore, we compare access, content, and
citation-based measures of relatedness on different recommendation tasks. As a
final result, an online recommendation system has been built that can help
scientists to find further relevant literature, without having to search for
them actively.

associated with a lower than expected rate of citations. In some fields, that
disparity is driven primarily by the citations of men and is increasing over
time despite increasing diversification of the profession. It is likely that
complex social interactions and individual ideologies shape these disparities.
Computational models of select factors that reproduce empirical observations
can help us understand some of the minimal driving forces behind these complex
phenomena and therefore aid in their mitigation. Here, we present a simple
agent-based model of citation practices within academia, in which academics
generate citations based on three factors: their estimate of the collaborative
network of the field, how they sample that estimate, and how open they are to
learning about their field from other academics. We show that increasing
homophily -- or the tendency of people to interact with others more like
themselves -- in these three domains is sufficient to reproduce observed biases
in citation practices. We find that homophily in sampling an estimate of the
field influences total citation rates, and openness to learning from new and
unfamiliar authors influences the change in those citations over time. We next
model a real-world intervention -- the citation diversity statement -- which
has the potential to influence both of these parameters. We determine a
parameterization of our model that matches the citation practices of academics
who use the citation diversity statement. This parameterization paired with an
openness to learning from many new authors can result in citation practices
that are equitable and stable over time. Ultimately, our work underscores the
importance of homophily in shaping citation practices and provides evidence
that specific actions may mitigate biased citation practices in academia.

This results in sub-optimal feature representation, affecting the model's performance on tasks involving dynamically changing graphs. To address this issue, we present Graph Selective States Focused Attention Networks (GSANs) based neural network architecture for graph-structured data. The GSAN is enabled by multi-head masked self-attention (MHMSA) and selective state space modeling (S3M) layers to overcome the limitations of GNNs. In GSAN, the MHMSA allows GSAN to dynamically emphasize crucial node connections, particularly in evolving graph environments. The S3M layer enables the network to adjust dynamically in changing node states and improving predictions of node behavior in varying contexts without needing primary knowledge of the graph structure. Furthermore, the S3M layer enhances the generalization of unseen structures and interprets how node states influence link importance. With this, GSAN effectively outperforms inductive and transductive tasks and overcomes the issues that traditional GNNs experience. To analyze the performance behavior of GSAN, a set of state-of-the-art comparative experiments are conducted on graphs benchmark datasets, including $Cora$, $Citeseer$, $Pubmed$ network citation, and $protein-protein-interaction$ datasets, as an outcome, GSAN improved the classification accuracy by $1.56\%$, $8.94\%$, $0.37\%$, and $1.54\%$ on $F1-score$ respectively."

of the literature focuses on transductive link prediction that requires all the
graph nodes and majority of links in training, inductive link prediction, which

challenging problem in various real-world applications. In this paper, we
propose a meta-learning approach with graph neural networks for link

perform both transductive and inductive learning tasks and adapt to patterns in
a large new graph after training with a small subgraph. Experiments on
real-world graphs are conducted to validate our model, where the results

other state-of-the-art models, and meanwhile generalizes well when training on

classification for deep neural network structures, e.g. convolutional neural
networks (CNN). The output of convolutional filters is modeled as a random
variable Y conditioned on the object class C and network filter bank F. The
conditional entropy (CENT) H(Y |C,F) is shown in theory and experiments to be a
highly compact and class-informative code, that can be computed from the filter
outputs throughout an existing CNN and used to obtain higher classification
results than the original CNN itself. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of CENT feature analysis in two separate CNN classification contexts. 1) In the
classification of neurodegeneration due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and natural
aging from 3D magnetic resonance image (MRI) volumes, 3 CENT features result in
an AUC=94.6% for whole-brain AD classification, the highest reported accuracy
on the public OASIS dataset used and 12% higher than the softmax output of the
original CNN trained for the task. 2) In the context of visual object
classification from 2D photographs, transfer learning based on a small set of
CENT features identified throughout an existing CNN leads to AUC values
comparable to the 1000-feature softmax output of the original network when
classifying previously unseen object categories. The general information
theoretical analysis explains various recent CNN design successes, e.g. densely
connected CNN architectures, and provides insights for future research
directions in deep learning.

space of the graph's adjacency matrix as input of deep neural networks.
Spectral coordinates in the spectral space capture the most useful topology
information of the network. Due to the small dimension of spectral coordinates
(compared with the dimension of the adjacency matrix derived from a graph),
training deep neural networks becomes feasible. We develop and evaluate two

are amazed by pictures of newscasting graph on Twitter, engaged by hidden

  To answer these questions, we first formally define the influence graph

using the Retraction Watch database. The retraction trend shows a steady
average growth in plagiarism cases of 1.2 times, while the fake peer review
exhibits a fluctuating pattern with an average growth of 5.5 times. Although
fewer papers are retracted in the plagiarism category compared to fake peer
reviews, plagiarism-related papers receive 2.5 times more citations.
Furthermore, the total number of retracted citations for plagiarized papers is
1.8 times higher than that for fake peer review papers. Within the plagiarism
category, 46% of the retracted citations are due to plagiarism, while 53.6% of
the retracted citations in the fake peer review category are attributed to the

often operate over the entire adjacency matrix -- as the input and intermediate
network layers are all designed in proportion to the size of the adjacency
matrix -- leading to intensive computation and large memory requirements as the

to reduce both run-time and memory requirements allowing for the analysis of

retrieval-augmented in-context learning, we introduce the hierarchical graph of
thoughts (HGOT), a structured, multi-layered graph approach designed to enhance
the retrieval of pertinent passages during in-context learning. The framework
utilizes the emergent planning capabilities of LLMs, employing the
divide-and-conquer strategy to break down complex queries into manageable
sub-queries. It refines self-consistency majority voting for answer selection,
which incorporates the recently proposed citation recall and precision metrics
to assess the quality of thoughts, linking an answer's credibility
intrinsically to the thought's quality. This methodology introduces a weighted
system in majority voting, prioritizing answers based on the citation quality
of their thoughts. Additionally, we propose a scoring mechanism for evaluating
retrieved passages, considering factors such as citation frequency and quality,
self-consistency confidence, and the retrieval module's ranking. Experiments
indicate that HGOT excels as a versatile approach, outperforming competing

the remarkable representation ability in learning the graph information.
However, GCNs, when implemented on a deep network, require expensive
computation power, making them difficult to be deployed on battery-powered

In this work, we propose SpikingGCN, an end-to-end framework that aims to

The original graph data are encoded into spike trains based on the
incorporation of graph convolution. We further model biological information
processing by utilizing a fully connected layer combined with neuron nodes. In
a wide range of scenarios (e.g. citation networks, image graph classification,

Furthermore, we show that SpikingGCN on a neuromorphic chip can bring a clear

outstanding performance in processing graph-structured data. However, the
undirected graphs limit their application scope. In this paper, we extend
spectral-based graph convolution to directed graphs by using first- and
second-order proximity, which can not only retain the connection properties of
the directed graph, but also expand the receptive field of the convolution
operation. A new GCN model, called DGCN, is then designed to learn
representations on the directed graph, leveraging both the first- and

working only with DGCNs can encode more useful information from graph and help
achieve better performance when generalized to other models. Moreover,
extensive experiments on citation networks and co-purchase datasets demonstrate

strings into their bibliography components such as ""Author"", ""Volume"",""Title"",
etc. This meta-data can be difficult to acquire accurately due to the thousands
of different styles and noise that can be applied to a bibliography to create
the citation string. Many approaches exist already to accomplish accurate
parsing of citation strings. This dissertation describes the creation of a
large data-set which can be used to aid in the training of these approaches
which have limited data.It also describes the investigation into if the
downfall of these approaches to citation parsing and in particular the machine
learning based approaches is because of the lack of size associated to the data
used to train them.

In this paper, we investigate the problem of detecting correlation between two Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs $G(n,p)$, formulated as a hypothesis testing problem: under the null hypothesis, the two graphs are independent, while under the alternative hypothesis, they are correlated. We develop a polynomial-time test by counting bounded degree motifs and prove its effectiveness for any constant correlation coefficient $\rho$ when the edge connecting probability satisfies $p\ge n^{-2/3}$. Our results overcome the limitation requiring $\rho \ge \sqrt{\alpha}$, where $\alpha\approx 0.338$ is the Otter's constant, extending it to any constant $\rho$. Methodologically, bounded degree motifs -- ubiquitous in real networks -- make the proposed statistic both natural and scalable. We also validate our method on synthetic and real co-citation networks, further confirming that this simple motif family effectively captures correlation signals and exhibits strong empirical performance."

possible mechanisms of human decision-making, we propose a novel theoretical
framework for the citation analysis. Given the existing trend to investigate
citation statistics in the context of various forms of power and Zipfian laws,
we show that the popular models of citation have poor predictive ability and
can hardly provide for an adequate explanation of the observed behavior of the

statistical mechanics. The model is applied to approximate the citation
frequencies of scientific articles from two large collections, and it
demonstrates a predictive potential much superior to the one of any of the
citation models known to the authors from the literature. Some analytical
properties of the developed model are discussed, and conclusions are drawn.

signals on a graph. Existing GC methods are limited to using the structural
information in the feature space. Additionally, the single step of GCs only
uses features on the one-hop neighboring nodes from the target node. In this
paper, we propose two methods to improve the performance of GCs: 1) Utilizing
structural information in the feature space, and 2) exploiting the multi-hop
information in one GC step. In the first method, we define three structural
features in the feature space: feature angle, feature distance, and relational
embedding. The second method aggregates the node-wise features of multi-hop
neighbors in a GC. Both methods can be simultaneously used. We also propose
graph neural networks (GNNs) integrating the proposed GC for classifying nodes
in 3D point clouds and citation networks. In experiments, the proposed GNNs
exhibited a higher classification accuracy than existing methods.

information spaces such as domains of the World Wide Web, citation graphs, and
on-line social networks. It uses a metric space to model the hidden attributes
of the vertices. Thus, vertices are elements of a metric space, and link
formation depends on the metric distance between vertices. We show, through
theoretical analysis and simulation, that for graphs formed according to the
SPA model it is possible to infer the metric distance between vertices from the
link structure of the graph. Precisely, the estimate is based on the number of
common neighbours of a pair of vertices, a measure known as {\sl co-citation}.
To be able to calculate this estimate, we derive a precise relation between the
number of common neighbours and metric distance. We also analyze the
distribution of {\sl edge lengths}, where the length of an edge is the metric
distance between its end points. We show that this distribution has three
different regimes, and that the tail of this distribution follows a power law.

that the low-dimensional embedded representation of nodes in the graph is
extremely useful in various typical tasks, such as node classification, link

binary relationship (i.e., edges) in the graph and have not leveraged the
higher order local structure (i.e., motifs) of the graph. Here, we propose
mGCMN -- a novel framework which utilizes node feature information and the
higher order local structure of the graph to effectively generate node
embeddings for previously unseen data. Through research we have found that
different types of networks have different key motifs. And the advantages of
our method over the baseline methods have been demonstrated in a large number
of experiments on citation network and social network datasets. At the same
time, a positive correlation between increase of the classification accuracy

(MPNNs) based on an extension of graphon analysis to a so called graphon-signal
analysis. A MPNN is a function that takes a graph and a signal on the graph (a
graph-signal) and returns some value. Since the input space of MPNNs is
non-Euclidean, i.e., graphs can be of any size and topology, properties such as
generalization are less well understood for MPNNs than for Euclidean neural
networks. We claim that one important missing ingredient in past work is a
meaningful notion of graph-signal similarity measure, that endows the space of
inputs to MPNNs with a regular structure. We present such a similarity measure,
called the graphon-signal cut distance, which makes the space of all
graph-signals a dense subset of a compact metric space -- the graphon-signal
space. Informally, two deterministic graph-signals are close in cut distance if
they ``look like'' they were sampled from the same random graph-signal model.
Hence, our cut distance is a natural notion of graph-signal similarity, which
allows comparing any pair of graph-signals of any size and topology. We prove
that MPNNs are Lipschitz continuous functions over the graphon-signal metric
space. We then give two applications of this result: 1) a generalization bound
for MPNNs, and, 2) the stability of MPNNs to subsampling of graph-signals. Our
results apply to any regular enough MPNN on any distribution of graph-signals,
making the analysis rather universal.

  Adaptive Feature and Graph Neural Network",cs.CL,"  Because most of the scientific literature data is unmarked, it makes semantic
representation learning based on unsupervised graph become crucial. At the same
time, in order to enrich the features of scientific literature, a learning
method of semantic representation of scientific literature based on adaptive
features and graph neural network is proposed. By introducing the adaptive
feature method, the features of scientific literature are considered globally
and locally. The graph attention mechanism is used to sum the features of
scientific literature with citation relationship, and give each scientific
literature different feature weights, so as to better express the correlation
between the features of different scientific literature. In addition, an
unsupervised graph neural network semantic representation learning method is
proposed. By comparing the mutual information between the positive and negative
local semantic representation of scientific literature and the global graph
semantic representation in the potential space, the graph neural network can
capture the local and global information, thus improving the learning ability
of the semantic representation of scientific literature. The experimental
results show that the proposed learning method of semantic representation of
scientific literature based on adaptive feature and graph neural network is
competitive on the basis of scientific literature classification, and has
achieved good results.

where data labels are scarce or possibly corrupted. We propose an approach
called $p$-conductance learning that generalizes the $p$-Laplace and Poisson
learning methods by introducing an objective reminiscent of $p$-Laplacian

a family of probability measure mincut programs that balance sparse edge
removal with accurate distribution separation. Our theoretical analysis
connects these programs to well-known variational and probabilistic problems on
graphs (including randomized cuts, effective resistance, and Wasserstein
distance) and provides motivation for robustness when labels are diffused via
the heat kernel. Computationally, we develop a semismooth Newton-conjugate
gradient algorithm and extend it to incorporate class-size estimates when
converting the continuous solutions into label assignments. Empirical results

scientific papers, where references of a scientific paper and their

citation graphs, it is still challenging to incorporate them into summarization
tasks. This is due to the difficulty of accurately identifying and leveraging
relevant content in references for a source paper, as well as capturing their
correlations of different intensities. Existing methods either ignore
references or utilize only abstracts indiscriminately from them, failing to
tackle the challenge mentioned above. To fill that gap, we propose a novel
citation-aware scientific paper summarization framework based on citation
graphs, able to accurately locate and incorporate the salient contents from
references, as well as capture varying relevance between source papers and
their references. Specifically, we first build a domain-specific dataset
PubMedCite with about 192K biomedical scientific papers and a large citation
graph preserving 917K citation relationships between them. It is characterized
by preserving the salient contents extracted from full texts of references, and
the weighted correlation between the salient contents of references and the
source paper. Based on it, we design a self-supervised citation-aware
summarization framework (CitationSum) with graph contrastive learning, which
boosts the summarization generation by efficiently fusing the salient
information in references with source paper contents under the guidance of
their correlations. Experimental results show that our model outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods, due to efficiently leveraging the information of
references and citation correlations.

Astronomer names were selected from various sources. From this work an
Astronomy Citation Database (ACD) has been constructed, containing citation
data for 6458+ astronomers, plus additional data for 173 astronomers and the
top-10 cited papers published 1981-1996. Various problems, both substantial and
subtle, of producing a reasonably fair citation database are detailed. Chief
among these are whether to assign either parital or full credit for each author
on a given paper. Whether one is honored with one of the top astronomy
lifetime-awards is a strong function of how well your work stands out as your
own, and in what kind of publications you publish (e.g., the ISI does not keep
track of papers in meeting proceedings/books/catalogs). Name confusion affects
this kind of analysis to the extent that that it would take an enormous effort
to disentangle its effects and, even then, not all name confusion would be
settled. A ``modest proposal'' is made that our professional field (and others)
go to a system of uniquely associating an identification number to each author

of individual papers cannot be added or averaged from the perspective of
theoretical analysis in mathematics: we provide mathematical proofs for the
crucial steps of the analysis. Second, we systematically classified the
existing main field normalization methods into linear and nonlinear field
normalization methods. The above two research works provide a theoretical basis
for the proper use of field normalization methods in the future, avoiding the
continued misuse of nonlinear data. Furthermore, because our mathematical proof
is applicable to all nonlinear data in the entire real number domain, our
research works are also meaningful for the whole field of data and information
science.

  Networks",cs.LG cs.AI,"  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved notable success in learning from
graph-structured data, owing to their ability to capture intricate dependencies
and relationships between nodes. They excel in various applications, including
semi-supervised node classification, link prediction, and graph generation.
However, it is important to acknowledge that the majority of state-of-the-art
GNN models are built upon the assumption of an in-distribution setting, which
hinders their performance on real-world graphs with dynamic structures. In this
article, we aim to assess the impact of training GNNs on localized subsets of
the graph. Such restricted training data may lead to a model that performs well
in the specific region it was trained on but fails to generalize and make
accurate predictions for the entire graph. In the context of graph-based
semi-supervised learning (SSL), resource constraints often lead to scenarios
where the dataset is large, but only a portion of it can be labeled, affecting
the model's performance. This limitation affects tasks like anomaly detection
or spam detection when labeling processes are biased or influenced by human
subjectivity. To tackle the challenges posed by localized training data, we
approach the problem as an out-of-distribution (OOD) data issue by by aligning
the distributions between the training data, which represents a small portion
of labeled data, and the graph inference process that involves making
predictions for the entire graph. We propose a regularization method to
minimize distributional discrepancies between localized training data and graph
inference, improving model performance on OOD data. Extensive tests on popular
GNN models show significant performance improvement on three citation GNN
benchmark datasets. The regularization approach effectively enhances model
adaptation and generalization, overcoming challenges posed by OOD data.

relatedness that can be utilized in the paper summarization task, for exploring

citation graphs to improve scientific paper extractive summarization under
different settings. We first propose a Multi-granularity Unsupervised
Summarization model (MUS) as a simple and low-cost solution to the task. MUS
finetunes a pre-trained encoder model on the citation graph by link prediction
tasks. Then, the abstract sentences are extracted from the corresponding paper
considering multi-granularity information. Preliminary results demonstrate that
citation graph is helpful even in a simple unsupervised framework. Motivated by
this, we next propose a Graph-based Supervised Summarization model (GSS) to
achieve more accurate results on the task when large-scale labeled data are
available. Apart from employing the link prediction as an auxiliary task, GSS
introduces a gated sentence encoder and a graph information fusion module to
take advantage of the graph information to polish the sentence representation.
Experiments on a public benchmark dataset show that MUS and GSS bring

Existing methods exploit homophily through designing homophily-aware GNN architectures or graph structure learning strategies, yet they primarily focus on GNN learning with training graphs. However, in real-world scenarios, test graphs often suffer from data quality issues and distribution shifts, such as domain shifts across users from different regions in social networks and temporal evolution shifts in citation network graphs collected over varying time periods. These factors significantly compromise the pre-trained model's robustness, resulting in degraded test-time performance. With empirical observations and theoretical analysis, we reveal that transforming the test graph structure by increasing homophily in homophilic graphs or decreasing it in heterophilic graphs can significantly improve the robustness and performance of pre-trained GNNs on node classifications, without requiring model training or update. Motivated by these insights, a novel test-time graph structural transformation method grounded in homophily, named GrapHoST, is proposed. Specifically, a homophily predictor is developed to discriminate test edges, facilitating adaptive test-time graph structural transformation by the confidence of predicted homophily scores. Extensive experiments on nine benchmark datasets under a range of test-time data quality issues demonstrate that GrapHoST consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, with improvements of up to 10.92%.

consider convolutional MNNs and GNNs where the manifold and the graph
convolutions are respectively defined in terms of the Laplace-Beltrami operator
and the graph Laplacian. Using the appropriate kernels, we analyze both dense
and moderately sparse graphs. We prove non-asymptotic error bounds showing that
convolutional filters and neural networks on these graphs converge to
convolutional filters and neural networks on the continuous manifold. As a
byproduct of this analysis, we observe an important trade-off between the
discriminability of graph filters and their ability to approximate the desired
behavior of manifold filters. We then discuss how this trade-off is ameliorated
in neural networks due to the frequency mixing property of nonlinearities. We
further derive a transferability corollary for geometric graphs sampled from
the same manifold. We validate our results numerically on a navigation control

for most papers, is set at the moment of publication. The fitness distributions
for different disciplines are very similar and can be approximated by the

related to the mechanism by which the knowledge about it spreads in the

origin to the fitness distribution, while deviations from universality are
associated with the discipline-specific citation dynamics of papers.

This study presents an empirical evaluation of KANs in context of class imbalanced classification, using ten benchmark datasets. We observe that KANs can inherently perform well on raw imbalanced data more effectively than Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) without any resampling strategy. However, conventional imbalance strategies fundamentally conflict with KANs mathematical structure as resampling and focal loss implementations significantly degrade KANs performance, while marginally benefiting MLPs. Crucially, KANs suffer from prohibitive computational costs without proportional performance gains. Statistical validation confirms that MLPs with imbalance techniques achieve equivalence with KANs (|d| < 0.08 across metrics) at minimal resource costs. These findings reveal that KANs represent a specialized solution for raw imbalanced data where resources permit. But their severe performance-resource tradeoffs and incompatibility with standard resampling techniques currently limits practical deployment. We identify critical research priorities as developing KAN specific architectural modifications for imbalance learning, optimizing computational efficiency, and theoretical reconciling their conflict with data augmentation. This work establishes foundational insights for next generation KAN architectures in imbalanced classification scenarios."

essential role in many scientific domains, e.g., computational biologist and

equivalence, we first introduce a localized variant of this concept --
ego-centered automorphic equivalence (Ego-AE). Then, we design a novel variant
of GNN, i.e., GRAPE, that uses learnable AE-aware aggregators to explicitly
differentiate the Ego-AE of each node's neighbors with the aids of various
subgraph templates. While the design of subgraph templates can be hard, we
further propose a genetic algorithm to automatically search them from graph

generating distinct representations for nodes with different Ego-AE features,
which fills in a fundamental gap of existing GNN variants. Finally, we

  empirical analysis based on propensity score matching",cs.DL,"  Field-normalization of citations is bibliometric standard. Despite the
observed differences in citation counts between fields, the question remains
how strong fields influence citation rates beyond the effect of attributes or
factors possibly influencing citations (FICs). We considered several FICs such
as number of pages and number of co-authors in this study. We wondered whether
there is a separate field-effect besides other effects (e.g., from numbers of
pages and co-authors). To find an answer on the question in this study, we
applied inverse-probability of treatment weighting (IPW). Using Web of Science
data (a sample of 308,231 articles), we investigated whether mean differences
among subject categories in citation rates still remain, even if the subject
categories are made comparable in the field-related attributes (e.g.,
comparable of co-authors, comparable number of pages) by IPW. In a diagnostic
step of our statistical analyses, we considered propensity scores as covariates
in regression analyses to examine whether the differences between the fields in
FICs vanish. The results revealed that the differences did not completely
vanish but were strongly reduced. We received similar results when we
calculated mean value differences of the fields after IPW representing the
causal or unconfounded field effects on citations. However, field differences
in citation rates remain. The results point out that field-normalization seems
to be a prerequisite for citation analysis and cannot be replaced by the
consideration of any set of FICs in citation analyses.

  Citation Data",physics.soc-ph physics.data-an,"  There are fundamental differences between citation networks and other classes
of graphs. In particular, given that citation networks are directed and
acyclic, methods developed primarily for use with undirected social network
data may face obstacles. This is particularly true for the dynamic development
of community structure in citation networks. Namely, it is neither clear when
it is appropriate to employ existing community detection approaches nor is it
clear how to choose among existing approaches. Using simulated data, we attempt
to clarify the conditions under which one should use existing methods and which
of these algorithms is appropriate in a given context. We hope this paper will
serve as both a useful guidepost and an encouragement to those interested in
the development of more targeted approaches for use with longitudinal citation

state-of-the-art results on several large-scale benchmark datasets. In this
paper, we carry out in-depth comparative analysis to better understand the

end, we develop an unified framework for both 2D-CNN and 3D-CNN action models,
which enables us to remove bells and whistles and provides a common ground for
fair comparison. We then conduct an effort towards a large-scale analysis
involving over 300 action recognition models. Our comprehensive analysis
reveals that a) a significant leap is made in efficiency for action
recognition, but not in accuracy; b) 2D-CNN and 3D-CNN models behave similarly
in terms of spatio-temporal representation abilities and transferability. Our

gnn_citations,graph neural networks for citation analysis,760,1908.06416,0.6411659,Investigating Convolutional Neural Networks using Spatial Orderness,cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML,"  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have been pivotal to the success of many
state-of-the-art classification problems, in a wide variety of domains (for
e.g. vision, speech, graphs and medical imaging). A commonality within those
domains is the presence of hierarchical, spatially agglomerative
local-to-global interactions within the data. For two-dimensional images, such
interactions may induce an a priori relationship between the pixel data and the
underlying spatial ordering of the pixels. For instance in natural images,
neighboring pixels are more likely contain similar values than non-neighboring
pixels which are further apart. To that end, we propose a statistical metric
called spatial orderness, which quantifies the extent to which the input data
(2D) obeys the underlying spatial ordering at various scales. In our
experiments, we mainly find that adding convolutional layers to a CNN could be
counterproductive for data bereft of spatial order at higher scales. We also
observe, quite counter-intuitively, that the spatial orderness of CNN feature
maps show a synchronized increase during the intial stages of training, and
validation performance only improves after spatial orderness of feature maps
start decreasing. Lastly, we present a theoretical analysis (and empirical
validation) of the spatial orderness of network weights, where we find that
using smaller kernel sizes leads to kernels of greater spatial orderness and
vice-versa.

illustrated (on ISI and PRE data sets) and analyzed by Redner [Eur. Phys. J. B
{\bf 4}, 131 (1998)]. To fit the data, a stretched exponential ($N(x) \propto
\exp{-(x/x_0)^{\beta}}$) has been used with only partial success. The success
is not complete because the data exhibit, for large citation count $x$, a power
law (roughly $N(x) \propto x^{-3}$ for the ISI data), which, clearly, the
stretched exponential does not reproduce. This fact is then attributed to a
possibly different nature of rarely cited and largely cited papers. We show
here that, within a nonextensive thermostatistical formalism, the same data can
be quite satisfactorily fitted with a single curve (namely, $N(x) \propto
1/[1+(q-1) \lambda x]^{q/{q-1}}$ for the available values of $x$. This is
consistent with the connection recently established by Denisov [Phys. Lett. A
{\bf 235}, 447 (1997)] between this nonextensive formalism and the
Zipf-Mandelbrot law. What the present analysis ultimately suggests is that, in
contrast to Redner's conclusion, the phenomenon might essentially be one and
the same along the entire range of the citation number $x$.

gnn_citations,graph neural networks for citation analysis,762,2208.07323,0.6411091,Signed Graph Neural Networks: A Frequency Perspective,cs.LG,"  Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) and its variants are designed for
unsigned graphs containing only positive links. Many existing GCNs have been
derived from the spectral domain analysis of signals lying over (unsigned)
graphs and in each convolution layer they perform low-pass filtering of the
input features followed by a learnable linear transformation. Their extension
to signed graphs with positive as well as negative links imposes multiple
issues including computational irregularities and ambiguous frequency
interpretation, making the design of computationally efficient low pass filters
challenging. In this paper, we address these issues via spectral analysis of
signed graphs and propose two different signed graph neural networks, one keeps
only low-frequency information and one also retains high-frequency information.
We further introduce magnetic signed Laplacian and use its eigendecomposition
for spectral analysis of directed signed graphs. We test our methods for node
classification and link sign prediction tasks on signed graphs and achieve
state-of-the-art performances.

  Salton's Cosine versus the Jaccard Index",physics.soc-ph cs.DL cs.IR,"  The debate about which similarity measure one should use for the
normalization in the case of Author Co-citation Analysis (ACA) is further
complicated when one distinguishes between the symmetrical co-citation--or,
more generally, co-occurrence--matrix and the underlying asymmetrical
citation--occurrence--matrix. In the Web environment, the approach of
retrieving original citation data is often not feasible. In that case, one
should use the Jaccard index, but preferentially after adding the number of
total citations (occurrences) on the main diagonal. Unlike Salton's cosine and
the Pearson correlation, the Jaccard index abstracts from the shape of the
distributions and focuses only on the intersection and the sum of the two sets.
Since the correlations in the co-occurrence matrix may partially be spurious,
this property of the Jaccard index can be considered as an advantage in this
case.

The system addresses limitations in existing RAG architectures through a multi-layered approach: hybrid retrieval combining semantic search, keyword filtering, and knowledge graph traversal; an agentic self-correction framework with iterative quality assurance; and post-hoc citation verification ensuring complete traceability. Our implementation processes scholarly literature through eight integrated stages: multi-source metadata acquisition, asynchronous PDF retrieval, custom document layout analysis using modified Docling architecture, bibliographic management, LLM-based field extraction, topic modeling, semantic unification, and knowledge graph construction. The system creates dual data products - a Neo4j knowledge graph enabling complex relationship queries and Qdrant vector collections supporting semantic search - serving as foundational infrastructure for verifiable information synthesis. Evaluation across 643 observations from 60 testing sessions demonstrates structured field extraction achieving 35.1% higher semantic similarity scores (0.655 $\pm$ 0.178) compared to PDF chunking approaches (0.485 $\pm$ 0.204, p < 0.000001). The agentic quality assurance mechanism achieves 68.3% single-pass success rates with 99.0% citation accuracy in validated responses.

multivariate time series is transformed into an image-like style and stacks of

quantification and interpretability, which are critical for trustworthy AI in
high-stakes domains. However, existing methods often struggle with issues such
as overconfidence, hyperparameter sensitivity, and posterior collapse, leaving
room for alternative approaches. In this work, we advance message passing (MP)
for BNNs and present a novel framework that models the predictive posterior as
a factor graph. To the best of our knowledge, our framework is the first MP
method that handles convolutional neural networks and avoids double-counting
training data, a limitation of previous MP methods that causes overconfidence.
We evaluate our approach on CIFAR-10 with a convolutional neural network of
roughly 890k parameters and find that it can compete with the SOTA baselines
AdamW and IVON, even having an edge in terms of calibration. On synthetic data,
we validate the uncertainty estimates and observe a strong correlation (0.9)
between posterior credible intervals and its probability of covering the true
data-generating function outside the training range. While our method scales to
an MLP with 5.6 million parameters, further improvements are necessary to match
the scale and performance of state-of-the-art variational inference methods.

stream graphs, a recent framework to model interactions over time. Formal
Concept Analysis provides a framework for analyzing concepts evolving within a
context. Considering graphs as the context, it has recently been applied to
perform closed pattern mining on social graphs. In this paper, we are
interested in pattern mining in sequences of interactions. After recalling and
extending notions from formal concept analysis on graphs to stream graphs, we
introduce algorithms to enumerate closed patterns on a labeled stream graph,
and introduce a way to select relevant closed patterns. We run experiments on
two real-world datasets of interactions among students and citations between
authors, and show both the feasibility and the relevance of our method.

dense subgraph induced by a particular attribute set. Existing methods are not
able to extract relevant knowledge regarding how vertex attributes interact

frequent itemset and quasi-clique mining problems. We propose statistical
significance measures that compare the structural correlation of attribute sets

gained widespread attention for their robust expressiveness and exceptional
performance in various graph applications. However, the efficacy of GNNs is
heavily reliant on sufficient data labels and complex network models, with the
former obtaining hardly and the latter computing costly. To address the labeled
data scarcity and high complexity of GNNs, Knowledge Distillation (KD) has been
introduced to enhance existing GNNs. This technique involves transferring the
soft-label supervision of the large teacher model to the small student model
while maintaining prediction performance. This survey offers a comprehensive
overview of Graph-based Knowledge Distillation methods, systematically
categorizing and summarizing them while discussing their limitations and future
directions. This paper first introduces the background of graph and KD. It then
provides a comprehensive summary of three types of Graph-based Knowledge
Distillation methods, namely Graph-based Knowledge Distillation for deep neural

Self-Knowledge Distillation based Graph-based Knowledge Distillation (SKD).
Each type is further divided into knowledge distillation methods based on the
output layer, middle layer, and constructed graph. Subsequently, various
algorithms' ideas are analyzed and compared, concluding with the advantages and
disadvantages of each algorithm supported by experimental results. In addition,
the applications of graph-based knowledge distillation in CV, NLP, RS, and

intentional perturbations on input features in visual classification tasks. Due
to the additional consideration of connections between examples (\eg articles
with citation link tend to be in the same class), graph neural networks could
be more sensitive to the perturbations, since the perturbations from connected
examples exacerbate the impact on a target example. Adversarial Training (AT),
a dynamic regularization technique, can resist the worst-case perturbations on
input features and is a promising choice to improve model robustness and
generalization. However, existing AT methods focus on standard classification,
being less effective when training models on graph since it does not model the
impact from connected examples.
  In this work, we explore adversarial training on graph, aiming to improve the
robustness and generalization of models learned on graph. We propose Graph
Adversarial Training (GraphAT), which takes the impact from connected examples
into account when learning to construct and resist perturbations. We give a
general formulation of GraphAT, which can be seen as a dynamic regularization
scheme based on the graph structure. To demonstrate the utility of GraphAT, we

conditions under which a graph can be partitioned into smaller pieces. The most
important tool for this partitioning is the Fiedler vector or discrete Cheeger
inequality. These results relate the graph spectrum (eigenvalues of the
normalized adjacency matrix) to the ability to break a graph into two pieces,
with few edge deletions. An entire subfield of mathematics, called spectral
graph theory, has emerged from these results. Yet these results do not say
anything about the rich community structure exhibited by real-world networks,
which typically have a significant fraction of edges contained in numerous
densely clustered blocks. Inspired by the properties of real-world networks, we
discover a new spectral condition that relates eigenvalue powers to a network
decomposition into densely clustered blocks. We call this the \emph{spectral
triadic decomposition}. Our relationship exactly predicts the existence of
community structure, as commonly seen in real networked data. Our proof
provides an efficient algorithm to produce the spectral triadic decomposition.
We observe on numerous social, coauthorship, and citation network datasets that
these decompositions have significant correlation with semantically meaningful
communities.

this paper, we propose a simplified visualization of the relationships between
scientific publications, in the form of a directed acyclic graph. From a given

which are one of the prevalent objects used to represent 3D geometry. Recent
works have developed models that exploit the intrinsic geometry of manifolds
and graphs, namely the Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and its spectral variants,
which learn from the local metric tensor via the Laplacian operator. Despite
offering excellent sample complexity and built-in invariances, intrinsic
geometry alone is invariant to isometric deformations, making it unsuitable for
many applications. To overcome this limitation, we propose several upgrades to
GNNs to leverage extrinsic differential geometry properties of
three-dimensional surfaces, increasing its modeling power.
  In particular, we propose to exploit the Dirac operator, whose spectrum
detects principal curvature directions --- this is in stark contrast with the
classical Laplace operator, which directly measures mean curvature. We coin the
resulting models \emph{Surface Networks (SN)}. We prove that these models
define shape representations that are stable to deformation and to
discretization, and we demonstrate the efficiency and versatility of SNs on two
challenging tasks: temporal prediction of mesh deformations under non-linear
dynamics and generative models using a variational autoencoder framework with
encoders/decoders given by SNs.

published, searching for references while writing a scientific paper is a
time-consuming process. A technique that could add a reference citation at the
appropriate place in a sentence will be beneficial. In this perspective,
context-aware citation recommendation has been researched upon for around two
decades. Many researchers have utilized the text data called the context
sentence, which surrounds the citation tag, and the metadata of the target
paper to find the appropriate cited research. However, the lack of
well-organized benchmarking datasets and no model that can attain high
performance has made the research difficult.
  In this paper, we propose a deep learning based model and well-organized
dataset for context-aware paper citation recommendation. Our model comprises a
document encoder and a context encoder, which uses Graph Convolutional Networks
(GCN) layer and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT),
which is a pre-trained model of textual data. By modifying the related PeerRead
dataset, we propose a new dataset called FullTextPeerRead containing context
sentences to cited references and paper metadata. To the best of our knowledge,
This dataset is the first well-organized dataset for context-aware paper

size. Experimental results show that SiCNN detects features at various scales,
and the classification result exhibits strong robustness against object scale
variations.

gnn_citations,graph neural networks for citation analysis,783,2007.03424,0.6362918,AEGCN: An Autoencoder-Constrained Graph Convolutional Network,cs.LG stat.ML,"  We propose a novel neural network architecture, called
autoencoder-constrained graph convolutional network, to solve node
classification task on graph domains. As suggested by its name, the core of
this model is a convolutional network operating directly on graphs, whose
hidden layers are constrained by an autoencoder. Comparing with vanilla graph
convolutional networks, the autoencoder step is added to reduce the information
loss brought by Laplacian smoothing. We consider applying our model on both
homogeneous graphs and heterogeneous graphs. For homogeneous graphs, the
autoencoder approximates to the adjacency matrix of the input graph by taking
hidden layer representations as encoder and another one-layer graph
convolutional network as decoder. For heterogeneous graphs, since there are
multiple adjacency matrices corresponding to different types of edges, the
autoencoder approximates to the feature matrix of the input graph instead, and
changes the encoder to a particularly designed multi-channel pre-processing
network with two layers. In both cases, the error occurred in the autoencoder
approximation goes to the penalty term in the loss function. In extensive
experiments on citation networks and other heterogeneous graphs, we demonstrate
that adding autoencoder constraints significantly improves the performance of
graph convolutional networks. Further, we notice that our technique can be
applied on graph attention network to improve the performance as well. This
reveals the wide applicability of the proposed autoencoder technique.

  Feature Distribution",cs.LG,"  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown expressive performance on graph
representation learning by aggregating information from neighbors. Recently,
some studies have discussed the importance of modeling neighborhood
distribution on the graph. However, most existing GNNs aggregate neighbors'
features through single statistic (e.g., mean, max, sum), which loses the
information related to neighbor's feature distribution and therefore degrades
the model performance. In this paper, inspired by the method of moment in
statistical theory, we propose to model neighbor's feature distribution with
multi-order moments. We design a novel GNN model, namely Mix-Moment Graph
Neural Network (MM-GNN), which includes a Multi-order Moment Embedding (MME)
module and an Element-wise Attention-based Moment Adaptor module. MM-GNN first
calculates the multi-order moments of the neighbors for each node as
signatures, and then use an Element-wise Attention-based Moment Adaptor to
assign larger weights to important moments for each node and update node
representations. We conduct extensive experiments on 15 real-world graphs
(including social networks, citation networks and web-page networks etc.) to
evaluate our model, and the results demonstrate the superiority of MM-GNN over
existing state-of-the-art models.

disease treatment innovation. The NIH-funded Bridge2AI project strives to
facilitate such innovations by uniting top-tier, diverse teams to curate
datasets designed for AI-driven biomedical research. We examined 1,699 dataset
papers from the Nucleic Acids Research (NAR) database issues and the Bridge2AI
Talent Knowledge Graph. By treating each paper's authors as a team, we explored
the relationship between team attributes (team power and fairness) and dataset
paper quality, measured by scientific impact (Relative Citation Ratio
percentile) and clinical translation power (APT, likelihood of citation by
clinical trials and guidelines). Utilizing the SHAP explainable AI framework,
we identified correlations between team attributes and the success of dataset
papers in both citation impact and clinical translation. Key findings reveal
that (1) PI (Principal Investigator) leadership and team academic prowess are
strong predictors of dataset success; (2) team size and career age are
positively correlated with scientific impact but show inverse patterns for
clinical translation; and (3) higher female representation correlates with
greater dataset success. Although our results are correlational, they offer
valuable insights into forming high-performing data generation teams. Future
research should incorporate causal frameworks to deepen understanding of these
relationships.

Preliminary testing suggests this method improves doctrinal relevance in the

main-memory algorithms exist for each. Simple graphs are not adequate for
modeling complex data sets with multiple entities and relationships. Multilayer
networks (MLNs) have been shown to be better suited, but there are very few
algorithms for centrality computation directly on MLNs. They are converted
(aggregated or collapsed) to simple graphs using Boolean AND or OR operators to
compute centrality, which is not only inefficient but incurs a loss of
structure and semantics. In this paper, we propose algorithms that compute
closeness centrality on an MLN directly using a novel decoupling-based
approach. Individual results of layers (or simple graphs) of an MLN are used
and a composition function developed to compute the centrality for the MLN. The
challenge is to do this accurately and efficiently. However, since these
algorithms do not have complete information of the MLN, computing a global
measure such as closeness centrality is a challenge. Hence, these algorithms
rely on heuristics derived from intuition. The advantage is that this approach
lends itself to parallelism and is more efficient compared to the traditional
approach. We present two heuristics for composition and experimentally validate
accuracy and efficiency on a large number of synthetic and real-world graphs
with diverse characteristics.

non-grid data, where the classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) cannot
be directly used. One similarity shared by GCNs and CNNs is the requirement of
massive amount of labeled data for network training. In addition, GCNs need the
adjacency matrix as input to define the relationship between those non-grid
data, which leads to all of data including training, validation and test data
typically forms only one graph structures data for training. Furthermore, the
adjacency matrix is usually pre-defined and stationary, which makes the data
augmentation strategies cannot be employed on the constructed graph structures
data to augment the amount of training data. To further improve the learning
capacity and model performance under the limited training data, in this paper,
we propose two types of self-supervised learning strategies to exploit
available information from the input graph structure data itself. Our proposed
self-supervised learning strategies are examined on two representative GCN
models with three public citation network datasets - Citeseer, Cora and Pubmed.
The experimental results demonstrate the generalization ability as well as the
portability of our proposed strategies, which can significantly improve the
performance of GCNs with the power of self-supervised learning in improving

such as citation networks, e-commerce networks and social networks has
attracted considerable attention in the web community. Recently, large language
models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities across a wide range of
tasks. However, the existing works focus on harnessing the potential of LLMs
solely relying on prompts to convey graph structure information to LLMs, thus
suffering from insufficient understanding of the complex structural
relationships within TAGs. To address this problem, in this paper we present
the Disentangled Graph-Text Learner (DGTL) model, which is able to enhance the
reasoning and predicting capabilities of LLMs for TAGs. Our proposed DGTL model
incorporates graph structure information through tailored disentangled graph
neural network (GNN) layers, enabling LLMs to capture the intricate
relationships hidden in text-attributed graphs from multiple structural
factors. Furthermore, DGTL operates with frozen pre-trained LLMs, reducing
computational costs and allowing much more flexibility in combining with
different LLM models. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed DGTL model on achieving superior or comparable performance over
state-of-the-art baselines. Additionally, we also demonstrate that our DGTL
model can offer natural language explanations for predictions, thereby
significantly enhancing model interpretability.

amount of scholars' influence determines whether their work will be accepted by
others. Most existing research focuses on predicting one paper's citation count
after a period or identifying the most influential papers among the massive
candidates, without concentrating on an individual paper's negative or positive
impact on its authors. Thus, this study aims to formulate the prediction
problem to identify whether one paper can increase scholars' influence or not,
which can provide feedback to the authors before they publish their papers.
First, we presented the self-adapted ACC (Average Annual Citation Counts)
metric to measure authors' impact yearly based on their annual published
papers, paper citation counts, and contributions in each paper. Then, we
proposed the RD-GAT (Reference-Depth Graph Attention Network) model to
integrate heterogeneous graph information from different depth of references by
assigning attention coefficients on them. Experiments on AMiner dataset
demonstrated that the proposed ACC metrics could represent the authors
influence effectively, and the RD-GAT model is more efficiently on the academic
citation network, and have stronger robustness against the overfitting problem
compared with the baseline models. By applying the framework in this work,
scholars can identify whether their papers can improve their influence in the

instead of electrons that can achieve substantially improved computing
performance. However, existing architectures can only handle data with regular
structures, e.g., images or videos, but fail to generalize to graph-structured
data beyond Euclidean space, e.g., social networks or document co-citation

architecture, termed diffractive graph neural network (DGNN), based on the
integrated diffractive photonic computing units (DPUs) to address this
limitation. Specifically, DGNN optically encodes node attributes into strip
optical waveguides, which are transformed by DPUs and aggregated by on-chip
optical couplers to extract their feature representations. Each DPU comprises
successive passive layers of metalines to modulate the electromagnetic optical
field via diffraction, where the metaline structures are learnable parameters
shared across graph nodes. DGNN captures complex dependencies among the node
neighborhoods and eliminates the nonlinear transition functions during the
light-speed optical message passing over graph structures. We demonstrate the
use of DGNN extracted features for node and graph-level classification tasks
with benchmark databases and achieve superior performance. Our work opens up a
new direction for designing application-specific integrated photonic circuits
for high-efficiency processing of large-scale graph data structures using deep

normalize citation counts for the field and the year in which a publication was
published. One mechanism is applied in the current so-called crown indicator of
our institute. The other mechanism is applied in the new crown indicator that

aggregation levels, such as at the level of research groups or at the level of
journals, the differences between the two mechanisms are somewhat larger. We
pay special attention to the way in which recent publications are handled.
These publications typically have very low citation counts and should therefore

represented as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). To detect communities in DAGs,
we propose a modularity for DAGs by defining an appropriate null model (i.e.,
randomized network) respecting the order of nodes. We implement a spectral
method to approximately maximize the proposed modularity measure and test the
method on citation networks and other DAGs. We find that the attained values of
the modularity for DAGs are similar for partitions that we obtain by maximizing
the proposed modularity (designed for DAGs), the modularity for undirected
networks and that for general directed networks. In other words, if we neglect
the order imposed on nodes (and the direction of links) in a given DAG and
maximize the conventional modularity measure, the obtained partition is close
to the optimal one in the sense of the modularity for DAGs.

where Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) are shown to converge to a Gaussian
process (GP) as all hidden layers are sent to infinite width. However, these
results do not apply to architectures that require one or more of the hidden
layers to remain narrow. In this paper, we consider the wide limit of BNNs
where some hidden layers, called ""bottlenecks"", are held at finite width. The
result is a composition of GPs that we term a ""bottleneck neural network
Gaussian process"" (bottleneck NNGP). Although intuitive, the subtlety of the
proof is in showing that the wide limit of a composition of networks is in fact
the composition of the limiting GPs. We also analyze theoretically a
single-bottleneck NNGP, finding that the bottleneck induces dependence between
the outputs of a multi-output network that persists through extreme
post-bottleneck depths, and prevents the kernel of the network from losing
discriminative power at extreme post-bottleneck depths.

solution to these issues would be to include in-text citations referring to

LLMs to generate in-text citations, their performances are far from

propose an effective training framework using fine-grained rewards to teach
LLMs to generate highly supportive and relevant citations, while ensuring the
correctness of their responses. We also conduct a systematic analysis of
applying these fine-grained rewards to common LLM training strategies,
demonstrating its advantage over conventional practices. We conduct extensive
experiments on Question Answering (QA) datasets taken from the ALCE benchmark

learning with graphs and have been increasingly applied in a multitude of
domains. Nevertheless, since most existing GNN models are based on flat
message-passing mechanisms, two limitations need to be tackled: (i) they are
costly in encoding long-range information spanning the graph structure; (ii)
they are failing to encode features in the high-order neighbourhood in the
graphs as they only perform information aggregation across the observed edges
in the original graph. To deal with these two issues, we propose a novel
Hierarchical Message-passing Graph Neural Networks framework. The key idea is
generating a hierarchical structure that re-organises all nodes in a flat graph
into multi-level super graphs, along with innovative intra- and inter-level
propagation manners. The derived hierarchy creates shortcuts connecting
far-away nodes so that informative long-range interactions can be efficiently
accessed via message passing and incorporates meso- and macro-level semantics
into the learned node representations. We present the first model to implement
this framework, termed Hierarchical Community-aware Graph Neural Network
(HC-GNN), with the assistance of a hierarchical community detection algorithm.
The theoretical analysis illustrates HC-GNN's remarkable capacity in capturing
long-range information without introducing heavy additional computation
complexity. Empirical experiments conducted on 9 datasets under transductive,
inductive, and few-shot settings exhibit that HC-GNN can outperform
state-of-the-art GNN models in network analysis tasks, including node
classification, link prediction, and community detection. Moreover, the model
analysis further demonstrates HC-GNN's robustness facing graph sparsity and the
flexibility in incorporating different GNN encoders.

videos, graphs, and triangular meshes. However, it has seldom been studied on
tetrahedral meshes. Given the merits of using volumetric meshes in applications
like brain image analysis, we introduce a novel interpretable graph CNN
framework for the tetrahedral mesh structure. Inspired by ChebyNet, our model
exploits the volumetric Laplace-Beltrami Operator (LBO) to define filters over
commonly used graph Laplacian which lacks the Riemannian metric information of
3D manifolds. For pooling adaptation, we introduce new objective functions for
localized minimum cuts in the Graclus algorithm based on the LBO. We employ a
piece-wise constant approximation scheme that uses the clustering assignment
matrix to estimate the LBO on sampled meshes after each pooling. Finally,
adapting the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping algorithm for
tetrahedral meshes, we use the obtained heatmaps to visualize discovered
regions-of-interest as biomarkers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
model on cortical tetrahedral meshes from patients with Alzheimer's disease, as
there is scientific evidence showing the correlation of cortical thickness to
neurodegenerative disease progression. Our results show the superiority of our
LBO-based convolution layer and adapted pooling over the conventionally used

Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) produce predictive uncertainty by propagating uncertainty in neural network (NN) weights and offer the promise of obtaining not only an accurate predictive model but also accurate UQ. However, in practice, obtaining accurate UQ with BNNs is difficult due in part to the approximations used for practical model training and in part to the need to choose a suitable set of hyperparameters; these hyperparameters outnumber those needed for traditional NNs and often have opaque effects on the results. We aim to shed light on the effects of hyperparameter choices for BNNs by performing a global sensitivity analysis of BNN performance under varying hyperparameter settings. Our results indicate that many of the hyperparameters interact with each other to affect both predictive accuracy and UQ. For improved usage of BNNs in real-world applications, we suggest that global sensitivity analysis, or related methods such as Bayesian optimization, should be used to aid in dimensionality reduction and selection of hyperparameters to ensure accurate UQ in BNNs."

However, common Neural Sheaf Diffusion implementations rely on SVD-based sheaf normalization and dense per-edge restriction maps, which scale with stalk dimension, require frequent Laplacian rebuilds, and yield brittle gradients. To address these limitations, we introduce Polynomial Neural Sheaf Diffusion (PolyNSD), a new sheaf diffusion approach whose propagation operator is a degree-K polynomial in a normalised sheaf Laplacian, evaluated via a stable three-term recurrence on a spectrally rescaled operator. This provides an explicit K-hop receptive field in a single layer (independently of the stalk dimension), with a trainable spectral response obtained as a convex mixture of K+1 orthogonal polynomial basis responses. PolyNSD enforces stability via convex mixtures, spectral rescaling, and residual/gated paths, reaching new state-of-the-art results on both homophilic and heterophilic benchmarks, inverting the Neural Sheaf Diffusion trend by obtaining these results with just diagonal restriction maps, decoupling performance from large stalk dimension, while reducing runtime and memory requirements."

To bridge this gap, we present FinRAGBench-V, a comprehensive visual RAG benchmark tailored for finance which effectively integrates multimodal data and provides visual citation to ensure traceability. It includes a bilingual retrieval corpus with 60,780 Chinese and 51,219 English pages, along with a high-quality, human-annotated question-answering (QA) dataset spanning heterogeneous data types and seven question categories. Moreover, we introduce RGenCite, an RAG baseline that seamlessly integrates visual citation with generation. Furthermore, we propose an automatic citation evaluation method to systematically assess the visual citation capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Extensive experiments on RGenCite underscore the challenging nature of FinRAGBench-V, providing valuable insights for the development of multimodal RAG systems in finance."

changing the size of the core of the most influential publications of a

how much the prefactor q influences the ranking. Likewise, the arbitrariness of
the highly-cited-publications indicator is due to the threshold value, given
either as an absolute number of citations or as a percentage of highly cited

the respective changes for the h-index.

of research assessment. Their databases use Web of Science (WoS) citation data,
which they match according to their own matching algorithms - in the case of
CWTS for standard usage in their studies and in the case of iFQ on an
experimental basis. Since the problem of non-matched citations in WoS persists
because of inaccuracies in the references or inaccuracies introduced in the
data extraction process, it is important to ascertain how well these
inaccuracies are rectified in these citation matching algorithms. This paper
evaluates the algorithms of CWTS and iFQ in comparison to WoS in a quantitative
and a qualitative analysis. The analysis builds upon the methodology and the
manually verified corpus of a previous study. The algorithm of CWTS performs
best, closely followed by that of iFQ. The WoS algorithm still performs quite
well (F1 score: 96.41 percent), but shows deficits in matching references
containing inaccuracies. An additional problem is posed by incorrectly provided

  Classification",cs.SI,"  Node classification has gained significant importance in graph deep learning
with real-world applications such as recommendation systems, drug discovery,
and citation networks. Graph Convolutional Networks and Graph Transformers have
achieved superior performance in node classification tasks. However, the key
concern with Graph Convolutional Networks is over-squashing, which limits their
ability to capture long-range dependencies in the network. Additionally, Graph
Transformers face scalability challenges, making it difficult to process large
graphs efficiently. To address this, we propose a novel framework, A Hybrid
SImilarity-Aware Graph Neural Network with Transformer for Node Classification
(SIGNNet), which capitalizes on local and global structural information,
enhances the model's capability to effectively capture fine-grained
relationships and broader contextual patterns within the graph structure. The
proposed method leverages Graph Convolutional Networks alongside a score-based
mechanism to effectively capture local and global node interactions while
addressing the limitations of over-squashing. Our proposed method employs a
novel Personalized PageRank-based node sampling method to address scalability
issues by generating subgraphs of nodes. Additionally, SIGNNet incorporates a
novel attention mechanism, Structure-Aware Multi-Head Attention (SA-MHA), which
integrates node structural information for informed attention weighting,
enabling the model to prioritize nodes based on topological significance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant improvements achieved by the
proposed method over existing state-of-the-art methods, with average accuracy

Yet, there are barely any studies of the phenomenon in the field of academic

this paper outlines a study to estimate the impact of scholarly citations that
female IS academics accumulate vis-\`a-vis their male colleagues. Drawing on a
scientometric study of the 7,260 papers published in the most prestigious IS
journals (known as the AIS Basket of Eight), our analysis aims to unveil
potential bias in the accumulation of citations between genders in the field.
We use panel regression to estimate the gendered citations accumulation in the

generation process is at odds with an author's desire to control specific

and use it to fine-tune a language model (LM) via next-token prediction. We
then utilize Proximal Policy Optimization to directly optimize the LM in favor
of a high score of our proposed controllability metric. The proposed workflow
harmoniously combines citation attribute suggestion and conditional citation

their self-reported trust in the generated responses. We found a significant
increase in trust when citations were present, a result that held true even
when the citations were random; we also found a significant decrease in trust
when participants checked the citations. These results highlight the importance

ordinary differential equations to vector fields on manifolds. In particular,
we construct combinatorial models for categories of modular continuous time
dynamical systems. Each such model, as a category, is a fibration over an
appropriate category of labeled directed graphs. This makes precise the
relation between dynamical systems living on networks and the combinatorial
structure of the underlying directed graphs, allowing us to exploit the

one graph to help classify unlabeled nodes in another graph, can be viewed as a
domain generalization problem of graph neural networks (GNNs) due to the
structure shift commonly appearing among various graphs. Nevertheless, current
endeavors for cross-graph node classification mainly focus on model training.
Data augmentation approaches, a simple and easy-to-implement domain
generalization technique, remain under-explored. In this paper, we develop a
new graph structure augmentation for the crossgraph domain generalization
problem. Specifically, low-weight edgedropping is applied to remove potential
noise edges that may hinder the generalization ability of GNNs, stimulating the
GNNs to capture the essential invariant information underlying different
structures. Meanwhile, clustering-based edge-adding is proposed to generate
invariant structures based on the node features from the same distribution.
Consequently, with these augmentation techniques, the GNNs can maintain the
domain invariant structure information that can improve the generalization
ability. The experiments on out-ofdistribution citation network datasets verify
our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among conventional
augmentations.

structures to reconstruct the graph And organize the characteristic information
of the nodes. Our method can effectively generate node embeddings for
previously unseen data, which has been proven in a series of experiments
conducted on citation networks and social networks (our method has advantages
over baseline methods). We believe that combining high-order local structural

a particular $l^{th}$ layer of the neural network model only the $l^{th}$ order
neighbourhood nodes of a social network are influential. Furthermore, the GCN
has been evaluated on citation and knowledge graphs, but not extensively on
friendship-based social graphs. The drawback associated with the dependencies
between layers and the order of node neighbourhood for the GCN can be more
prevalent for friendship-based graphs. The evaluation of the full potential of
the GCN on friendship-based social network requires openly available datasets
in larger quantities. However, most available social network datasets are not
complete. Also, the majority of the available social network datasets do not
contain both the features and ground truth labels. In this work, firstly, we
provide a guideline on simulating dynamic social networks, with ground truth
labels and features, both coupled with the topology. Secondly, we introduce an
open-source Python-based simulation library. We argue that the topology of the
network is driven by a set of latent variables, termed as the social DNA
(sDNA). We consider the sDNA as labels for the nodes. Finally, by evaluating on
our simulated datasets, we propose four new variants of the GCN, mainly to
overcome the limitation of dependency between the order of node-neighbourhood
and a particular layer of the model. We then evaluate the performance of all
the models and our results show that on 27 out of the 30 simulated datasets our
proposed GCN variants outperform the original model.

However, LLM hallucination, generating plausible but factually incorrect citations to source code, remains a critical barrier to reliable developer assistance. This paper addresses the challenges of achieving verifiable, citation grounded code comprehension through hybrid retrieval and lightweight structural reasoning. Our work is grounded in systematic evaluation across 30 Python repositories with 180 developer queries, comparing retrieval modalities, graph expansion strategies, and citation verification mechanisms. We find that challenges of citation accuracy arise from the interplay between sparse lexical matching, dense semantic similarity, and cross file architectural dependencies. Among these, cross file evidence discovery is the largest contributor to citation completeness, but it is largely overlooked because existing systems rely on pure textual similarity without leveraging code structure. We advocate for citation grounded generation as an architectural principle for code comprehension systems and demonstrate this need by achieving 92 percent citation accuracy with zero hallucinations. Specifically, we develop a hybrid retrieval system combining BM25 sparse matching, BGE dense embeddings, and Neo4j graph expansion via import relationships, which outperforms single mode baselines by 14 to 18 percentage points while discovering cross file evidence missed by pure text similarity in 62 percent of architectural queries."

previous studies on TCRs have not specifically focused on technical content,
such as academic papers and patents, whose effective curation requires

focuses on both the content and its citation relationships, for which curator
assignment uses the Personalized PageRank (PPR) algorithm while reward
computation uses a multi-task peer-prediction mechanism. Our proposed CitedTCR
bridges the literature on network-based and token-based recommender systems and
contributes to the autonomous development of an evolving citation graph for
high-quality content. Moreover, we experimentally confirm the incentive for

to be challenged need to be backed by citations. There are millions of articles
available online and thousands of new articles are released each month. For
this reason, finding relevant sources is a difficult task: many claims do not
have any references that support them. Furthermore, even existing citations
might not support a given claim or become obsolete once the original source is
updated or deleted. Hence, maintaining and improving the quality of Wikipedia
references is an important challenge and there is a pressing need for better
tools to assist humans in this effort. Here, we show that the process of
improving references can be tackled with the help of artificial intelligence
(AI). We develop a neural network based system, called Side, to identify
Wikipedia citations that are unlikely to support their claims, and subsequently
recommend better ones from the web. We train this model on existing Wikipedia
references, therefore learning from the contributions and combined wisdom of
thousands of Wikipedia editors. Using crowd-sourcing, we observe that for the
top 10% most likely citations to be tagged as unverifiable by our system,
humans prefer our system's suggested alternatives compared to the originally
cited reference 70% of the time. To validate the applicability of our system,
we built a demo to engage with the English-speaking Wikipedia community and
find that Side's first citation recommendation collects over 60% more
preferences than existing Wikipedia citations for the same top 10% most likely
unverifiable claims according to Side. Our results indicate that an AI-based

Wikipedia. More generally, we hope that our work can be used to assist fact
checking efforts and increase the general trustworthiness of information
online.

citation recommendation generally consider recommending one ground-truth
citation for a query context from an input manuscript, but lack of
consideration on co-citation recommendations. However, a piece of context often

novel scientific paper modeling for citation recommendations, namely
Multi-Positive BERT Model for Citation Recommendation (MP-BERT4CR), complied
with a series of Multi-Positive Triplet objectives to recommend multiple
positive citations for a query context. The proposed approach has the following
advantages: First, the proposed multi-positive objectives are effective to
recommend multiple positive candidates. Second, we adopt noise distributions
which are built based on the historical co-citation frequencies, so that
MP-BERT4CR is not only effective on recommending high-frequent co-citation
pairs; but also the performances on retrieving the low-frequent ones are
significantly improved. Third, we propose a dynamic context sampling strategy
which captures the ``macro-scoped'' citing intents from a manuscript and
empowers the citation embeddings to be content-dependent, which allow the
algorithm to further improve the performances. Single and multiple positive

improvements. In addition, MP-BERT4CR are also effective in retrieving the full
list of co-citations, and historically low-frequent co-citation pairs compared

Convolutional Network (GCN). How to effectively leverage the rich structural
information in complex graphs, such as knowledge graphs with heterogeneous
types of entities and relations, is a primary open challenge in the field. Most
GCN methods are either restricted to graphs with a homogeneous type of edges
(e.g., citation links only), or focusing on representation learning for nodes
only instead of jointly propagating and updating the embeddings of both nodes
and edges for target-driven objectives. This paper addresses these limitations
by proposing a novel framework, namely the Knowledge Embedding based Graph
Convolutional Network (KE-GCN), which combines the power of GCNs in graph-based
belief propagation and the strengths of advanced knowledge embedding (a.k.a.
knowledge graph embedding) methods, and goes beyond. Our theoretical analysis
shows that KE-GCN offers an elegant unification of several well-known GCN
methods as specific cases, with a new perspective of graph convolution.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets show the advantageous performance of
KE-GCN over strong baseline methods in the tasks of knowledge graph alignment

these three databases from 2001 to 2020. Results show that different from
SCIE/SSCI, both the annual publication volumes in the A&HCI database and all
A&HCI journals have remained relatively stagnant in all document types
considered scenario or have gained relatively slight increases in only citable
items considered scenario. Although the number of A&HCI journals also has
increased remarkably, the average journal publication volume of A&HCI journals
has decreased gradually if all document types are considered or kept relatively
stagnant when citable items only are considered. Besides, the A&HCI database
has ceased the systematic index of individually selected items from SCIE/SSCI
journals since 2018. The study finally discusses the possible causes and
consequences of the unbalanced expansion of WoSCC's different citation indexes.

gnn_citations,graph neural networks for citation analysis,836,1006.2307,0.6216599,Exploring the randomness of Directed Acyclic Networks,physics.soc-ph cond-mat.soft cs.DS q-bio.QM,"  The feed-forward relationship naturally observed in time-dependent processes
and in a diverse number of real systems -such as some food-webs and electronic
and neural wiring- can be described in terms of so-called directed acyclic
graphs (DAGs). An important ingredient of the analysis of such networks is a
proper comparison of their observed architecture against an ensemble of
randomized graphs, thereby quantifying the {\em randomness} of the real systems
with respect to suitable null models. This approximation is particularly
relevant when the finite size and/or large connectivity of real systems make
inadequate a comparison with the predictions obtained from the so-called {\em
configuration model}. In this paper we analyze four methods of DAG
randomization as defined by the desired combination of topological invariants
(directed and undirected degree sequence and component distributions) aimed to
be preserved. A highly ordered DAG, called \textit{snake}-graph and a
Erd\:os-R\'enyi DAG were used to validate the performance of the algorithms.
Finally, three real case studies, namely, the \textit{C. elegans} cell lineage
network, a PhD student-advisor network and the Milgram's citation network were
analyzed using each randomization method. Results show how the interpretation
of degree-degree relations in DAGs respect to their randomized ensembles depend
on the topological invariants imposed. In general, real DAGs provide disordered
values, lower than the expected by chance when the directedness of the links is
not preserved in the randomization process. Conversely, if the direction of the
links is conserved throughout the randomization process, disorder indicators
are close to the obtained from the null-model ensemble, although some
deviations are observed.

various graph structural data learning tasks. However, to mitigate the
over-smoothing phenomenon, and deal with heterogeneous graph structural data,
the design of GCN model remains a crucial issue to be investigated. In this
paper, we propose a novel GCN called SStaGCN (Simplified stacking based GCN) by
utilizing the ideas of stacking and aggregation, which is an adaptive general
framework for tackling heterogeneous graph data. Specifically, we first use the
base models of stacking to extract the node features of a graph. Subsequently,
aggregation methods such as mean, attention and voting techniques are employed
to further enhance the ability of node features extraction. Thereafter, the
node features are considered as inputs and fed into vanilla GCN model.
Furthermore, theoretical generalization bound analysis of the proposed model is
explicitly given. Extensive experiments on $3$ public citation networks and
another $3$ heterogeneous tabular data demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of the proposed approach over state-of-the-art GCNs. Notably, the
proposed SStaGCN can efficiently mitigate the over-smoothing problem of GCN.

convolutional neural networks (CNN) provide an end-to-end solution in
handwritten Chinese character recognition (HCCR) with great success. However,
the process of learning discriminative features for image recognition is
difficult in cases where little data is available. In this paper, we propose a
novel method for learning siamese neural network which employ a special
structure to predict the similarity between handwritten Chinese characters and
template images. The optimization of siamese neural network can be treated as a
simple binary classification problem. When the training process has been
finished, the powerful discriminative features help us to generalize the
predictive power not just to new data, but to entirely new classes that never
appear in the training set. Experiments performed on the ICDAR-2013 offline
HCCR datasets have shown that the proposed method has a very promising
generalization ability to the new classes that never appear in the training
set.

we propose a novel approach to improve BNNs performance through deep mutual

parameter distributions and feature distributions, promoting peer networks to
acquire distinct features that capture different characteristics of the input,
which enhances the effectiveness of mutual learning. Experimental results
demonstrate significant improvements in the classification accuracy, negative
log-likelihood, and expected calibration error when compared to traditional

An additional critical step for students is to identify the necessary prerequisite knowledge and learning paths. Although many approaches based on large language models (LLMs) can summarize the content of papers and trace the development of a field through citations, these methods often overlook the prerequisite knowledge involved in the papers and the rich semantic information embedded in the citation relationships between papers. Such information reveals how methods are interrelated, built upon, extended, or challenged. To address these limitations, we propose GoAI, a tool for constructing educational knowledge graphs from AI research papers that leverages these graphs to plan personalized learning paths and support creative ideation. The nodes in the knowledge graph we have built include papers and the prerequisite knowledge, such as concepts, skills, and tools, that they involve; the edges record the semantic information of citations. When a student queries a specific paper, a beam search-based path search method can trace the current development trends of the field from the queried paper and plan a learning path toward cutting-edge objectives. The integrated Idea Studio guides students to clarify problem statements, compare alternative designs, and provide formative feedback on novelty, clarity, feasibility, and alignment with learning objectives."

attention in graph representation learning. However, existing SGNNs are limited
in implementing graph filters with rigid transforms (e.g., graph Fourier or
predefined graph wavelet transforms) and cannot adapt to signals residing on
graphs and tasks at hand. In this paper, we propose a novel class of graph
neural networks that realizes graph filters with adaptive graph wavelets.
Specifically, the adaptive graph wavelets are learned with neural
network-parameterized lifting structures, where structure-aware attention-based
lifting operations (i.e., prediction and update operations) are developed to
jointly consider graph structures and node features. We propose to lift based
on diffusion wavelets to alleviate the structural information loss induced by
partitioning non-bipartite graphs. By design, the locality and sparsity of the
resulting wavelet transform as well as the scalability of the lifting structure
are guaranteed. We further derive a soft-thresholding filtering operation by
learning sparse graph representations in terms of the learned wavelets,
yielding a localized, efficient, and scalable wavelet-based graph filters. To
ensure that the learned graph representations are invariant to node
permutations, a layer is employed at the input of the networks to reorder the
nodes according to their local topology information. We evaluate the proposed
networks in both node-level and graph-level representation learning tasks on
benchmark citation and bioinformatics graph datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed networks over existing SGNNs in
terms of accuracy, efficiency, and scalability.

In addition, we explored the impact of these stratagems on the whole search

the citation search stratagem.

been adopted into many fields for their strengths in transparency,

widely used for graph-structured data processing due to their powerful
representation learning capabilities. It is generally believed that GNNs can
implicitly remove the non-predictive noises. However, the analysis of implicit
denoising effect in graph neural networks remains open. In this work, we
conduct a comprehensive theoretical study and analyze when and why the implicit
denoising happens in GNNs. Specifically, we study the convergence properties of
noise matrix. Our theoretical analysis suggests that the implicit denoising
largely depends on the connectivity, the graph size, and GNN architectures.
Moreover, we formally define and propose the adversarial graph signal denoising
(AGSD) problem by extending graph signal denoising problem. By solving such a
problem, we derive a robust graph convolution, where the smoothness of the node
representations and the implicit denoising effect can be enhanced. Extensive
empirical evaluations verify our theoretical analyses and the effectiveness of
our proposed model.

  Learning on Heterogeneous Graph",cs.IR cs.CL,"  While the volume of scholarly publications has increased at a frenetic pace,
accessing and consuming the useful candidate papers, in very large digital
libraries, is becoming an essential and challenging task for scholars.
Unfortunately, because of language barrier, some scientists (especially the
junior ones or graduate students who do not master other languages) cannot
efficiently locate the publications hosted in a foreign language repository. In
this study, we propose a novel solution, cross-language citation recommendation
via Hierarchical Representation Learning on Heterogeneous Graph (HRLHG), to
address this new problem. HRLHG can learn a representation function by mapping
the publications, from multilingual repositories, to a low-dimensional joint
embedding space from various kinds of vertexes and relations on a heterogeneous
graph. By leveraging both global (task specific) plus local (task independent)
information as well as a novel supervised hierarchical random walk algorithm,
the proposed method can optimize the publication representations by maximizing
the likelihood of locating the important cross-language neighborhoods on the
graph. Experiment results show that the proposed method can not only outperform
state-of-the-art baseline models, but also improve the interpretability of the
representation model for cross-language citation recommendation task.

is defined as $\frac{n-1}{\sum_{w \in V} d(v,w)}$. This measure is widely used
in the analysis of real-world complex networks, and the problem of selecting
the $k$ most central vertices has been deeply analysed in the last decade.
However, this problem is computationally not easy, especially for large
networks: in the first part of the paper, we prove that it is not solvable in
time $\O(|E|^{2-\epsilon})$ on directed graphs, for any constant $\epsilon>0$,
under reasonable complexity assumptions. Furthermore, we propose a new
algorithm for selecting the $k$ most central nodes in a graph: we
experimentally show that this algorithm improves significantly both the
textbook algorithm, which is based on computing the distance between all pairs
of vertices, and the state of the art. For example, we are able to compute the
top $k$ nodes in few dozens of seconds in real-world networks with millions of
nodes and edges. Finally, as a case study, we compute the $10$ most central
actors in the IMDB collaboration network, where two actors are linked if they
played together in a movie, and in the Wikipedia citation network, which
contains a directed edge from a page $p$ to a page $q$ if $p$ contains a link

  large-scale retrospective analysis based on PubMed",cs.DL,"  This paper explored the temporal characteristics of clinical citations of
biomedical papers, including how long it takes to receive its first clinical
citation (the initial stage) and how long it takes to receive two or more
clinical citations after its first clinical citation (the build-up stage). Over
23 million biomedical papers in PubMed between 1940 and 2013 and their clinical
citations are used as the research data. We divide these biomedical papers into
three groups and four categories from clinical citation level and translational
science perspectives. We compare the temporal characteristics of biomedical
papers of different groups or categories. From the perspective of clinical
citation level, the results show that highly clinically cited papers had
obvious advantages of receiving clinical citations over medium and lowly
clinically cited papers in both the initial and build-up stages. Meanwhile, as
the number of clinical citations increased in the build-up stage, the
difference in the length of time to receive the corresponding number of
clinical citations among the three groups of biomedical papers significantly
increased. From the perspective of translational science, the results reveal
that biomedical papers closer to clinical science more easily receive clinical
citations than papers closer to basic science in both the initial and build-up
stages. Moreover, we found that highly clinically cited papers had the
desperate advantage of receiving clinical citations over even the clinical
guidelines or clinical trials. The robustness analysis of the two aspects
demonstrates the reliability of our results.

classification through convolution and pooling. In particular, image pooling
transforms a connected discrete grid into a reduced grid with the same
connectivity and allows reduction functions to take into account all the pixels
of an image. However, a pooling satisfying such properties does not exist for
graphs. Indeed, some methods are based on a vertex selection step which induces
an important loss of information. Other methods learn a fuzzy clustering of
vertex sets which induces almost complete reduced graphs. We propose to
overcome both problems using a new pooling method, named MIVSPool. This method
is based on a selection of vertices called surviving vertices using a Maximal
Independent Vertex Set (MIVS) and an assignment of the remaining vertices to
the survivors. Consequently, our method does not discard any vertex information
nor artificially increase the density of the graph. Experimental results show
an increase in accuracy for graph classification on various standard datasets.

we propose a 3D point-based scene graph generation ($\mathbf{SGG_{point}}$)
framework to effectively bridge perception and reasoning to achieve scene

Convolutional Network ($\texttt{EdgeGCN}$) is created to exploit
multi-dimensional edge features for explicit relationship modeling, together
with the exploration of two associated twinning interaction mechanisms between
nodes and edges for the independent evolution of scene graph representations.
Overall, our integrated $\mathbf{SGG_{point}}$ framework is established to seek
and infer scene structures of interest from both real-world and synthetic 3D
point-based scenes. Our experimental results show promising edge-oriented

datasets, including the node-wise classification on citation networks and
whole-graph recognition problems for molecular analysis.

information on the intrinsic properties of data inaccessible to conventional

hindering the successful application of TDA in real-world studies, particularly
with machine learning on large complex networks.
  Indeed, most modern networks such as citation, blockchain, and online social
networks often have hundreds of thousands of vertices, making the application
of existing TDA methods infeasible. We develop two new, remarkably simple but
effective algorithms to compute the exact persistence diagrams of large graphs
to address this major TDA limitation. First, we prove that $(k+1)$-core of a

$PD_k(\mathcal{G})$. Second, we introduce a pruning algorithm for graphs to
compute their persistence diagrams by removing the dominated vertices. Our
experiments on large networks show that our novel approach can achieve
computational gains up to 95%.

and TDA, with applications in machine learning of large complex networks. Our

we propose a new preferential P-DropEdge method based on the Girvan-Newman

following the Girvan-Newman algorithm, we detect network periphery structures
using information on edge betweenness and then remove edges according to their

inter-channel correlations through a trainable adjacency matrix. The
interpretability is enhanced by revealing critical areas of brain activity and
their interrelations in various mental states. In validations on two public

models face the challenge of Bayesian inference in a high-dimensional and
usually over-parameterized space. This paper investigates a new line of
Bayesian deep learning by performing Bayesian inference on network structure.
Instead of building structure from scratch inefficiently, we draw inspirations
from neural architecture search to represent the network structure. We then
develop an efficient stochastic variational inference approach which unifies
the learning of both network structure and weights. Empirically, our method
exhibits competitive predictive performance while preserving the benefits of
Bayesian principles across challenging scenarios. We also provide convincing
experimental justification for our modeling choice.

  Prediction",cs.LG cs.AI,"  Link prediction is a crucial graph-learning task with applications including
citation prediction and product recommendation. Distilling Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) teachers into Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) students has
emerged as an effective approach to achieve strong performance and reducing
computational cost by removing graph dependency. However, existing distillation
methods only use standard GNNs and overlook alternative teachers such as
specialized model for link prediction (GNN4LP) and heuristic methods (e.g.,
common neighbors). This paper first explores the impact of different teachers
in GNN-to-MLP distillation. Surprisingly, we find that stronger teachers do not
always produce stronger students: MLPs distilled from GNN4LP can underperform
those distilled from simpler GNNs, while weaker heuristic methods can teach
MLPs to near-GNN performance with drastically reduced training costs. Building
on these insights, we propose Ensemble Heuristic-Distilled MLPs (EHDM), which
eliminates graph dependencies while effectively integrating complementary
signals via a gating mechanism. Experiments on ten datasets show an average
7.93% improvement over previous GNN-to-MLP approaches with 1.95-3.32 times less
training time, indicating EHDM is an efficient and effective link prediction
method.

invariance properties are encoded through in deep CNN architectures is still an
open question. In this paper, we propose to modify the standard convo- lutional
block of CNN in order to transfer more information layer after layer while
keeping some invariance within the net- work. Our main idea is to exploit both
positive and negative high scores obtained in the convolution maps. This behav-
ior is obtained by modifying the traditional activation func- tion step before
pooling. We are doubling the maps with spe- cific activations functions, called
MaxMin strategy, in order to achieve our pipeline. Extensive experiments on two
classical datasets, MNIST and CIFAR-10, show that our deep MaxMin convolutional

problems. However, their prediction error for unseen test data is difficult to
estimate a priori since the neural networks are trained using only selected
data and their architecture are largely considered a blackbox. This poses a
fundamental challenge to neural networks for unsupervised learning or
improvement beyond the label. In this paper, we show that the recent
unsupervised learning methods such as Noise2Noise, Stein's unbiased risk
estimator (SURE)-based denoiser, and Noise2Void are closely related to each
other in their formulation of an unbiased estimator of the prediction error,
but each of them are associated with its own limitations. Based on these
observations, we provide a novel boosting estimator for the prediction error.
In particular, by employing combinatorial convolutional frame representation of
encoder-decoder CNN and synergistically combining it with the batch
normalization, we provide a close form formulation for the unbiased estimator
of the prediction error that can be minimized for neural network training
beyond the label. Experimental results show that the resulting algorithm, what
we call Noise2Boosting, provides consistent improvement in various inverse
problems under both supervised and unsupervised learning setting.

graph-structured data with each node associated with raw texts. For TAGs,
traditional few-shot node classification methods directly conduct training on
the pre-processed node features and do not consider the raw texts. The
performance is highly dependent on the choice of the feature pre-processing
method. In this paper, we propose P2TAG, a framework designed for few-shot node
classification on TAGs with graph pre-training and prompting. P2TAG first
pre-trains the language model (LM) and graph neural network (GNN) on TAGs with
self-supervised loss. To fully utilize the ability of language models, we adapt
the masked language modeling objective for our framework. The pre-trained model
is then used for the few-shot node classification with a mixed prompt method,
which simultaneously considers both text and graph information. We conduct
experiments on six real-world TAGs, including paper citation networks and

proposed framework outperforms existing graph few-shot learning methods on
these datasets with +18.98% ~ +35.98% improvements.

  Neural Networks with Theoretical Guarantees",cs.LG cs.CR cs.CV,"  Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in
many graph-based tasks such as node classification and graph classification.
However, many recent works have demonstrated that an attacker can mislead GNN
models by slightly perturbing the graph structure. Existing attacks to GNNs are
either under the less practical threat model where the attacker is assumed to
access the GNN model parameters, or under the practical black-box threat model
but consider perturbing node features that are shown to be not enough
effective. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap and consider black-box
attacks to GNNs with structure perturbation as well as with theoretical
guarantees. We propose to address this challenge through bandit techniques.
Specifically, we formulate our attack as an online optimization with bandit
feedback. This original problem is essentially NP-hard due to the fact that
perturbing the graph structure is a binary optimization problem. We then
propose an online attack based on bandit optimization which is proven to be
{sublinear} to the query number $T$, i.e., $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N}T^{3/4})$ where
$N$ is the number of nodes in the graph. Finally, we evaluate our proposed
attack by conducting experiments over multiple datasets and GNN models. The
experimental results on various citation graphs and image graphs show that our
attack is both effective and efficient. Source code is available

We show that the proposed models are more effective than the HNN at regressing

We propose a new parameterization adding to each point a set of differential

edges and use it to efficiently detect them in acquired point clouds. After
successfully applying a multi-scale CNN on SSMs for the efficient

  Text-Attributed Graphs",cs.SI,"  Text-attributed Graphs (TAGs) are commonly found in the real world, such as
social networks and citation networks, and consist of nodes represented by
textual descriptions. Currently, mainstream machine learning methods on TAGs
involve a two-stage modeling approach: (1) unsupervised node feature extraction
with pre-trained language models (PLMs); and (2) supervised learning using
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, we observe that these representations,
which have undergone large-scale pre-training, do not significantly improve
performance with a limited amount of training samples. The main issue is that
existing methods have not effectively integrated information from the graph and
downstream tasks simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel framework
called G-Prompt, which combines a graph adapter and task-specific prompts to
extract node features. First, G-Prompt introduces a learnable GNN layer
(\emph{i.e.,} adaptor) at the end of PLMs, which is fine-tuned to better
capture the masked tokens considering graph neighborhood information. After the
adapter is trained, G-Prompt incorporates task-specific prompts to obtain
\emph{interpretable} node representations for the downstream task. Our
experiment results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms current
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on few-shot node classification. More
importantly, in zero-shot settings, the G-Prompt embeddings can not only
provide better task interpretability than vanilla PLMs but also achieve
comparable performance with fully-supervised baselines.

inference mechanisms. The datasets on which they are trained and evaluated can
be seen as database facts containing ground terms. This makes possible modeling
their inference mechanisms with equivalent logic programs, to better understand
not just how they propagate information between the entities involved in the
machine learning process but also to infer limits on what can be learned from a
given dataset and how well that might generalize to unseen test data.
  This leads us to the key idea of this paper: modeling with the help of a
logic program the information flows involved in learning to infer from the link
structure of a graph and the information content of its nodes properties of new
nodes, given their known connections to nodes with possibly similar properties.
The problem is known as graph node property prediction and our approach will
consist in emulating with help of a Prolog program the key information
propagation steps of a Graph Neural Network's training and inference stages.
  We test our a approach on the ogbn-arxiv node property inference benchmark.
To infer class labels for nodes representing papers in a citation network, we
distill the dependency trees of the text associated to each node into directed
acyclic graphs that we encode as ground Prolog terms. Together with the set of
their references to other papers, they become facts in a database on which we
reason with help of a Prolog program that mimics the information propagation in
graph neural networks predicting node properties. In the process, we invent
ground term similarity relations that help infer labels in the test set by
propagating node properties from similar nodes in the training set and we
evaluate their effectiveness in comparison with that of the graph's link
structure. Finally, we implement explanation generators that unveil performance
upper bounds inherent to the dataset.
  As a practical outcome, we obtain a logic program, that, when seen as machine
learning algorithm, performs close to the state of the art on the node property
prediction benchmark.

for their ability to provide well-calibrated posterior uncertainties. However,
model selection---even choosing the number of nodes---remains an open question.
In this work, we apply a horseshoe prior over node pre-activations of a
Bayesian neural network, which effectively turns off nodes that do not help
explain the data. We demonstrate that our prior prevents the BNN from
under-fitting even when the number of nodes required is grossly over-estimated.
Moreover, this model selection over the number of nodes doesn't come at the
expense of predictive or computational performance; in fact, we learn smaller

in the contexts discussed above. This is because the indicators would still
have flaws in addition to the generic limitations of citation-based indicators
and would still be inadequate for replacing peer review. Thus, the expense of
the data gathering does not always justify the value in practice of the extra

different temporal graph neural network (TGNs) configurations can impact the

Geometric Temporal came up with a few benchmark datasets but most of these

literature by performing a qualitative analysis of spatial-temporal dependence
structure learning on dynamic graphs, as well as a comparative study of the
effectiveness of selected TGNs on node and edge prediction tasks. Additionally,
an extensive ablation study will be conducted on different variants of the
best-performing TGN to identify the key factors contributing to its
performance. By achieving these objectives, this project will provide valuable
insights into the design and optimization of TGNs for dynamic graph analysis,
with potential applications in areas such as disease spread prediction, social

generated via MCMC sampling from the parameter space of a neural network, can
yield via Bayesian marginalization a valuable posterior predictive distribution
of the output of the neural network. Classification examples based on
multilayer perceptrons showcase highly accurate posterior predictive
distributions. The postulate of limited scope for MCMC developments in BNNs is
partially valid; an asymptotically exact parameter posterior seems less
plausible, yet an accurate posterior predictive distribution is a tenable
research avenue.

many other real networks from a high density, giving it a particular structure
that we call concentrated world and that differentiates a national legal system
(as considered with a resolution at the code level) from small-world graphs
identified in many social networks. Our analysis then shows that a few
communities (groups of highly wired vertices) of codes covering large domains
of regulation are structuring the whole system. Indeed we mainly find a central
group of influent codes, a group of codes related to social issues and a group

social media, citation networks in academic websites, and threads data in
online forums. Due to the complex topology, it is difficult to process and make
use of the rich information within such data. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have
shown great advantages on learning representations for structural data.
However, the non-transparency of the deep learning models makes it non-trivial
to explain and interpret the predictions made by GNNs. Meanwhile, it is also a
big challenge to evaluate the GNN explanations, since in many cases, the
ground-truth explanations are unavailable.
  In this paper, we take insights of Counterfactual and Factual (CF^2)
reasoning from causal inference theory, to solve both the learning and
evaluation problems in explainable GNNs. For generating explanations, we
propose a model-agnostic framework by formulating an optimization problem based
on both of the two casual perspectives. This distinguishes CF^2 from previous
explainable GNNs that only consider one of them. Another contribution of the
work is the evaluation of GNN explanations. For quantitatively evaluating the
generated explanations without the requirement of ground-truth, we design
metrics based on Counterfactual and Factual reasoning to evaluate the necessity
and sufficiency of the explanations. Experiments show that no matter
ground-truth explanations are available or not, CF^2 generates better
explanations than previous state-of-the-art methods on real-world datasets.
Moreover, the statistic analysis justifies the correlation between the

Graph-based networks to abstract features have emerged as a promising

with the advantages of Bayesian formalism. In recent years, the analysis of
wide, deep BNNs has provided theoretical insight into their priors and
posteriors. However, we have no analogous insight into their posteriors under
approximate inference. In this work, we show that mean-field variational
inference entirely fails to model the data when the network width is large and
the activation function is odd. Specifically, for fully-connected BNNs with odd
activation functions and a homoscedastic Gaussian likelihood, we show that the
optimal mean-field variational posterior predictive (i.e., function space)
distribution converges to the prior predictive distribution as the width tends
to infinity. We generalize aspects of this result to other likelihoods. Our
theoretical results are suggestive of underfitting behavior previously
observered in BNNs. While our convergence bounds are non-asymptotic and
constants in our analysis can be computed, they are currently too loose to be
applicable in standard training regimes. Finally, we show that the optimal
approximate posterior need not tend to the prior if the activation function is
not odd, showing that our statements cannot be generalized arbitrarily.

numerous main-memory algorithms. However, for modeling complex data sets with
multiple types of entities and relationships, simple graphs are not ideal.
Multilayer networks (or MLNs) have been proposed for modeling them and have
been shown to be better suited in many ways. Since there are no algorithms for
computing centrality measures directly on MLNs, existing strategies reduce
(aggregate or collapse) the MLN layers to simple networks using Boolean AND or
OR operators. This approach negates the benefits of MLN modeling as these
computations tend to be expensive and furthermore results in loss of structure

computing centrality measures (specifically, degree centrality) on MLNs
directly (i.e., without reducing them to simple graphs) using a newly-proposed
decoupling-based approach which is efficient as well as structure and semantics
preserving. We propose multiple heuristics to calculate the degree centrality

with Boolean OR aggregated Homogeneous MLNs (HoMLN) for ground truth. The
network decoupling approach can take advantage of parallelism and is more

  Speed-up Active Learning",cs.LG stat.ML,"  Active learning methods for neural networks are usually based on greedy
criteria which ultimately give a single new design point for the evaluation.
Such an approach requires either some heuristics to sample a batch of design
points at one active learning iteration, or retraining the neural network after
adding each data point, which is computationally inefficient. Moreover,
uncertainty estimates for neural networks sometimes are overconfident for the
points lying far from the training sample. In this work we propose to
approximate Bayesian neural networks (BNN) by Gaussian processes, which allows
us to update the uncertainty estimates of predictions efficiently without
retraining the neural network, while avoiding overconfident uncertainty

increased predictive capability. In addition to improving the predictions of
neural networks, there is a simultaneous demand for reliable uncertainty
quantification on estimates made by machine learning methods such as neural
networks. Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) are an important type of neural
network with built-in capability for quantifying uncertainty. This paper
discusses aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in BNNs and how they can be
calculated. With an example dataset of images where the goal is to identify the
amplitude of an event in the image, it is shown that epistemic uncertainty
tends to be lower in images which are well-represented in the training dataset
and tends to be high in images which are not well-represented. An algorithm for
out-of-distribution (OoD) detection with BNN epistemic uncertainty is
introduced along with various experiments demonstrating factors influencing the
OoD detection capability in a BNN. The OoD detection capability with epistemic
uncertainty is shown to be comparable to the OoD detection in the discriminator

the graph data. However, recent works show that the classical GAT is vulnerable
to adversarial attacks. It degrades dramatically with slight perturbations.
Therefore, how to enhance the robustness of GAT is a critical problem. Robust
GAT(RoGAT) is proposed in this paper to improve the robustness of GAT based on
the revision of the attention mechanism. Different from the original GAT, which
uses the attention mechanism for different edges but is still sensitive to the

improves the robustness. Firstly, RoGAT revises the edges weight based on the
smoothness assumption which is quite common for ordinary graphs. Secondly,
RoGAT further revises the features to suppress features' noise. Then, an extra
attention score is generated by the dynamic edge's weight and can be used to
reduce the impact of adversarial attacks. Different experiments against
targeted and untargeted attacks on citation data on citation data demonstrate
that RoGAT outperforms most of the recent defensive methods.

the past several years. With more than \$40 billion market capitalization, this
decentralized ecosystem produces massive, anonymous and real transaction
activities, which naturally forms a complicated transaction network. However,
there is limited understanding about the characteristics of this emerging NFT
ecosystem from a temporal graph analysis perspective. To mitigate this gap, we
instantiate a live graph with NFT transaction network and investigate its

downloading and parsing the NFT transaction activities, we obtain a temporal
graph with more than 4.5 million nodes and 124 million edges. Then, a series of

natural sciences. At the same time, prior knowledge of function values is often
available in these domains. For example, data-free biophysics-based models can
be informative on protein properties, while quantum-based computations can be
informative on small molecule properties. How can we coherently leverage such
prior knowledge to help improve a neural network model that is quite accurate
in some regions of input space -- typically near the training data -- but
wildly wrong in other regions? Bayesian neural networks (BNN) enable the user
to specify prior information only on the neural network weights, not directly
on the function values. Moreover, there is in general no clear mapping between
these. Herein, we tackle this problem by developing an approach to augment BNNs
with prior information on the function values themselves. Our probabilistic
approach yields predictions that rely more heavily on the prior information
when the epistemic uncertainty is large, and more heavily on the neural network
when the epistemic uncertainty is small.

dominated the field of Computer Vision (CV). Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have
performed remarkably well across diverse domains because they can represent
complex relationships via unstructured graphs. However, the applicability of
GNNs for visual tasks was unexplored till the introduction of Vision GNNs
(ViG). Despite the success of ViGs, their performance is severely bottlenecked
due to the expensive $k$-Nearest Neighbors ($k$-NN) based graph construction.
Recent works addressing this bottleneck impose constraints on the flexibility
of GNNs to build unstructured graphs, undermining their core advantage while
introducing additional inefficiencies. To address these issues, in this paper,
we propose a novel method called Dynamic Efficient Graph Convolution (DEGC) for
designing efficient and globally aware ViGs. DEGC partitions the input image
and constructs graphs in parallel for each partition, improving graph
construction efficiency. Further, DEGC integrates local intra-graph and global
inter-graph feature learning, enabling enhanced global context awareness. Using
DEGC as a building block, we propose a novel CNN-GNN architecture, ClusterViG,
for CV tasks. Extensive experiments indicate that ClusterViG reduces end-to-end
inference latency for vision tasks by up to $5\times$ when compared against a
suite of models such as ViG, ViHGNN, PVG, and GreedyViG, with a similar model
parameter count. Additionally, ClusterViG reaches state-of-the-art performance
on image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation tasks,
demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed globally aware learning
strategy. Finally, input partitioning performed by DEGC enables ClusterViG to
be trained efficiently on higher-resolution images, underscoring the

selection of operations during training with a schedule. Technically, an
architecture or a cell is represented as a directed graph. Our SDAS gradually
fixes the operations on the edges in the graph in a progressive and scheduled
manner, as opposed to a one-step decision of operations for all the edges once
the training completes in existing DAS, which may make the architecture
brittle. Moreover, we enlarge the search space of SDAS particularly for video
recognition by devising several unique operations to encode spatio-temporal
dynamics and demonstrate the impact in affecting the architecture search of
SDAS. Extensive experiments of architecture learning are conducted on CIFAR10,
Kinetics10, UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets, and superior results are reported when
comparing to DAS method. More remarkably, the search by our SDAS is around

used to create a homogeneous database of magnetic field measurements. However,
no systematic comparison of FORS field measurements to those obtained with
other instruments has been undertaken so far. AIMS. We exploit the FORS archive
of circular spectropolarimetric data to examine in a general way how reliable
and accurate field detections obtained with FORS are. METHODS. We examine the
observations of Ap and Bp stars, on the grounds that almost all of the
unambiguous detections of magnetic fields in the FORS1 archive are in these
kinds of stars. We assess the overall quality of the FORS1 magnetic data by
examining the consistency of field detections with what is known from previous
measurements obtained with other instruments, and we look at patterns of
internal consistency. RESULTS. FORS1 magnetic measurements are fully consistent
with those made with other instruments, and the internal consistency of the
data is excellent. However, it is important to recognise that each choice of
grism and wavelength window constitutes a distinct instrumental measuring
system, and that simultaneous field measurements in different instrumental
systems may produce field strength values that differ up to 20 %, or more.
Furthermore, we found that field measurements using hydrogen lines only yield
results that meaningfully reflect the field strength as sampled specifically by
lines of hydrogen for stars with effective temperatures above about 9000 K.
CONCLUSIONS. In general the magnetic field measurements of Ap and Bp stars
obtained with FORS1 are of excellent quality, accuracy and precision, and FORS1
provides an extremely useful example that offers valuable lessons for field
measurements with other low- resolution Cassegrain spectropolarimeters.

assumes a Bernoulli distribution on the weights by using Dropout.Several
attempts to optimize the dropout rate exist, e.g. using a variational
approach.In this paper, we present a new method called ""Dropout Regulation""
(DR), which consists of automatically adjusting the dropout rate during
training using a controller as used in automation.DR allows for a precise
estimation of the uncertainty which is comparable to the state-of-the-art while

domains including land coverage analysis, autonomous driving, and medical image
analysis. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) and Vision Transformers (ViTs)
provide the architecture models for semantic segmentation. Even though ViTs
have proven success in image classification, they cannot be directly applied to
dense prediction tasks such as image segmentation and object detection since
ViT is not a general purpose backbone due to its patch partitioning scheme. In
this survey, we discuss some of the different ViT architectures that can be
used for semantic segmentation and how their evolution managed the above-stated
challenge. The rise of ViT and its performance with a high success rate
motivated the community to slowly replace the traditional convolutional neural
networks in various computer vision tasks. This survey aims to review and
compare the performances of ViT architectures designed for semantic
segmentation using benchmarking datasets. This will be worthwhile for the
community to yield knowledge regarding the implementations carried out in
semantic segmentation and to discover more efficient methodologies using ViTs.

many real-world applications, such as facial recognition, image classification,
human pose estimation, and semantic segmentation. Despite their success, CNNs
are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where slight changes to their inputs may
lead to sharp changes in their output in even well-trained networks. Set-based
analysis methods can detect or prove the absence of bounded adversarial
attacks, which can then be used to evaluate the effectiveness of neural network
training methodology. Unfortunately, existing verification approaches have
limited scalability in terms of the size of networks that can be analyzed.
  In this paper, we describe a set-based framework that successfully deals with
real-world CNNs, such as VGG16 and VGG19, that have high accuracy on ImageNet.
Our approach is based on a new set representation called the ImageStar, which
enables efficient exact and over-approximative analysis of CNNs. ImageStars
perform efficient set-based analysis by combining operations on concrete images
with linear programming (LP). Our approach is implemented in a tool called NNV,
and can verify the robustness of VGG networks with respect to a small set of
input states, derived from adversarial attacks, such as the DeepFool attack.
The experimental results show that our approach is less conservative and faster
than existing zonotope methods, such as those used in DeepZ, and the polytope
method used in DeepPoly.

the leading medical image segmentation backbones. Nonetheless, due to their
limitations in either preserving global image context or efficiently processing
irregular shapes in visual objects, these backbones struggle to effectively
integrate information from diverse anatomical regions and reduce
inter-individual variability, particularly for the vasculature. Motivated by
the successful breakthroughs of graph neural networks (GNN) in capturing
topological properties and non-Euclidean relationships across various fields,
we propose NexToU, a novel hybrid architecture for medical image segmentation.
NexToU comprises improved Pool GNN and Swin GNN modules from Vision GNN (ViG)
for learning both global and local topological representations while minimizing
computational costs. To address the containment and exclusion relationships
among various anatomical structures, we reformulate the topological interaction
(TI) module based on the nature of binary trees, rapidly encoding the
topological constraints into NexToU. Extensive experiments conducted on three

potential in various fields. However, GNNs are still vulnerable to adversarial
attacks. Numerous adversarial defense methods on GNNs are proposed to address
the problem of adversarial attacks. However, these methods can only serve as a

an urgent need for a method to repair poisoned GNN. In this paper, we address
this gap by introducing the novel concept of model repair for GNNs. We propose
a repair framework, Repairing Robustness of Graph Neural Networks via Machine
Unlearning (GraphMU), which aims to fine-tune poisoned GNN to forget
adversarial samples without the need for complete retraining. We also introduce
a unlearning validation method to ensure that our approach effectively forget
specified poisoned data. To evaluate the effectiveness of GraphMU, we explore
three fine-tuned subgraph construction scenarios based on the available
perturbation information: (i) Known Perturbation Ratios, (ii) Known Complete
Knowledge of Perturbations, and (iii) Unknown any Knowledge of Perturbations.
Our extensive experiments, conducted across four citation datasets and four

generally repurposed semantic segmentation architectures and suffer from the
poor delineation of long and curved regions. Lack of overall road topology and

the inter-play between these two tasks unlocks superior performance from two
perspectives: (1) the hierarchically detected road borders enable the network
to capture and encode holistic road structure to enhance road connectivity (2)
identifying the intrinsic correlation of semantic landcover regions mitigates
the difficulty in recognizing roads cluttered by regions with similar

diversified and high requirements from a wide variety of emerging applications.
The complexity and diversity of Telecom networks place an increasing strain on

To detect network faults, and mitigate future failures, prior work focused on
leveraging traditional ML/DL methods to locate anomalies in networks. The
current approaches, although powerful, do not consider the intertwined nature
of embedded and software-intensive Radio Access Network systems. In this paper,
we propose a Bi-level Federated Graph Neural Network anomaly detection and

privacy-preserving manner, while minimizing communication costs. Our method
revolves around conceptualizing Telecom data as a bi-level temporal Graph
Neural Networks. The first graph captures the interactions between different
RAN nodes that are exposed to different deployment scenarios in the network,
while each individual Radio Access Network node is further elaborated into its
software (SW) execution graph. Additionally, we use Federated Learning to
address privacy and security limitations. Furthermore, we study the performance
of anomaly detection model under three settings: (1) Centralized (2) Federated

as widely used in industrial practice, mainly because of their increased memory
and compute costs. In this work, we investigate quantisation of BNNs by
compressing 32-bit floating-point weights and activations to their integer
counterparts, that has already been successful in reducing the compute demand
in standard pointwise neural networks. We study three types of quantised BNNs,
we evaluate them under a wide range of different settings, and we empirically
demonstrate that a uniform quantisation scheme applied to BNNs does not
substantially decrease their quality of uncertainty estimation.

a simple approach to incorporate the coordinate information to the CNN model

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been attracting increasing attention
in hyperspectral (HS) image classification, owing to their ability to capture
spatial-spectral feature representations. Nevertheless, their ability in
modeling relations between samples remains limited. Beyond the limitations of
grid sampling, graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have been recently proposed
and successfully applied in irregular (or non-grid) data representation and
analysis. In this paper, we thoroughly investigate CNNs and GCNs (qualitatively
and quantitatively) in terms of HS image classification. Due to the
construction of the adjacency matrix on all the data, traditional GCNs usually
suffer from a huge computational cost, particularly in large-scale remote
sensing (RS) problems. To this end, we develop a new mini-batch GCN (called
miniGCN hereinafter) which allows to train large-scale GCNs in a mini-batch
fashion. More significantly, our miniGCN is capable of inferring out-of-sample
data without re-training networks and improving classification performance.
Furthermore, as CNNs and GCNs can extract different types of HS features, an
intuitive solution to break the performance bottleneck of a single model is to
fuse them. Since miniGCNs can perform batch-wise network training (enabling the
combination of CNNs and GCNs) we explore three fusion strategies: additive
fusion, element-wise multiplicative fusion, and concatenation fusion to measure
the obtained performance gain. Extensive experiments, conducted on three HS
datasets, demonstrate the advantages of miniGCNs over GCNs and the superiority
of the tested fusion strategies with regards to the single CNN or GCN models.

the realm of variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), offers promising
computational advantages for tackling combinatorial optimization problems.
Well-defined initial circuit parameters, responsible for preparing a
parameterized quantum state encoding the solution, play a key role in
optimizing QAOA. However, classical optimization techniques encounter
challenges in discerning optimal parameters that align with the optimal
solution. In this work, we propose a hybrid optimization approach that
integrates Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN),
and a bilinear strategy as an innovative alternative to conventional optimizers
for predicting optimal parameters of QAOA circuits. GRU serves to
stochastically initialize favorable parameters for depth-1 circuits, while CNN
predicts initial parameters for depth-2 circuits based on the optimized
parameters of depth-1 circuits. To assess the efficacy of our approach, we
conducted a comparative analysis with traditional initialization methods using
QAOA on Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph instances, revealing superior optimal
approximation ratios. We employ the bilinear strategy to initialize QAOA
circuit parameters at greater depths, with reference parameters obtained from
GRU-CNN optimization. This approach allows us to forecast parameters for a
depth-12 QAOA circuit, yielding a remarkable approximation ratio of 0.998
across 10 qubits, which surpasses that of the random initialization strategy
and the PPN2 method at a depth of 10. The proposed hybrid GRU-CNN bilinear
optimization method significantly improves the effectiveness and accuracy of
parameters initialization, offering a promising iterative framework for QAOA
that elevates its performance.

principled way. Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) enables efficient
BNN learning by drawing samples from the BNN posterior using mini-batches.
However, SGLD and its extensions require storage of many copies of the model
parameters, a potentially prohibitive cost, especially for large neural
networks. We propose a framework, Adversarial Posterior Distillation, to
distill the SGLD samples using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). At
test-time, samples are generated by the GAN. We show that this distillation
framework incurs no loss in performance on recent BNN applications including
anomaly detection, active learning, and defense against adversarial attacks. By
construction, our framework not only distills the Bayesian predictive
distribution, but the posterior itself. This allows one to compute quantities
such as the approximate model variance, which is useful in downstream tasks. To
our knowledge, these are the first results applying MCMC-based BNNs to the
aforementioned downstream applications.

that photon noise is not the only source of uncertainty. As a consequence of
our new analysis and assessment of the uncertainties, we are not able to

Significant evolutionary effects were found for redshifts 2 < z < 4. Most
conspicuous are the increase of the average C IV absorption strength, of the
dust reddening, and of the intrinsic UV luminosity, and the decrease of the
average Ly alpha emission strength with decreasing redshift. In part the
observed evolutionary effects can be attributed to an increase of the
metallicity of the galaxies with cosmic age. Moreover, the increase of the
total star-formation rates and the stronger obscuration of the starburst cores
by dusty gas clouds suggest the occurrence of more massive starbursts at later
cosmic epochs.

applicable to high-z objects, we find a significant increase of the average
metallicities from about 0.16 Z_sun at the cosmic epoch corresponding to z ~

$\mathcal{O}(10)\%$ efficiency even if the hotspot temperature is
$\mathcal{O}(10)$ times smaller than the average CMB fluctuations. Overall, the
CNN search is sensitive to heavy particle masses $M_0/H_I=\mathcal{O}(200)$,
and constitutes one of the unique probes of very high energy particle physics.

  Component",cs.LG stat.ML,"  Neural Networks (NN) have been proposed in the past as an effective means for
both modeling and control of systems with very complex dynamics. However,
despite the extensive research, NN-based controllers have not been adopted by
the industry for safety critical systems. The primary reason is that systems
with learning based controllers are notoriously hard to test and verify. Even
harder is the analysis of such systems against system-level specifications. In
this paper, we provide a gradient based method for searching the input space of
a closed-loop control system in order to find adversarial samples against some
system-level requirements. Our experimental results show that combined with
randomized search, our method outperforms Simulated Annealing optimization.

host galaxies at high redshifts up to z~3.4. We compare our results to those of
other authors and discuss the correlation between galaxy evolution and quasar
activity. We analysed broad-band images in eight filters (from U to K) of eight
quasars in the FORS Deep Field with redshifts between z=0.87 and z=3.37. A
fully 2-dimensional decomposition was carried out to detect and resolve the
host galaxies. We were able to resolve the host galaxies of two out of eight
quasars between z=0.87 and z=2.75. Additionally, two host galaxies were
possibly resolved. The resolved low-redshift quasar (z=0.9) was identified as a
late type galaxy with a moderate star formation rate of 1.8 M_{sun}/yr hosting
a supermassive black hole with a mass of <10^{8}M_{sun}. The resolved high
redshift host galaxy (z=2.8) shows moderate star formation of 4.4-6.9
M_{sun}/yr, for the black hole mass we found a lower limit of >10^{7}M_{sun}.
All quasars host supermassive black hole with masses in the range
~10^{7}-10^{9}M_{sun}. Our findings are well consistent with those of other
authors.

of disk galaxies in 7 rich clusters with 0.3<=z<0.6. Spatially resolved MOS
spectra have been obtained with FORS at the VLT. We concentrate here on the
clusters MS1008.1-1224 at z=0.30 and Cl0413-6559 (F1557.19TC) at z=0.51. Out of
22 cluster members, 12 galaxies exhibit a rotation curve of the universal form
rising in the inner region and passing over into a flat part. The other members
have intrinsically peculiar kinematics. The 12 cluster galaxies for which a
maximum rotation velocity could be derived are distributed in the Tully-Fisher
diagram very similar to field galaxies from the FORS Deep Field with
corresponding redshifts. The same is true for 6 galaxies observed in the
cluster fields that turned out not to be members. In particular, these cluster
spirals do not show any significant luminosity evolution as might be expected
from certain clusterspecific phenomena. Contrary to that, the other half of the
cluster sample with disturbed kinematics also shows a higher degree of
structural assymetries on average indicating ongoing or recent interaction
processes.

  2012aw reveal an asymmetric explosion",astro-ph.HE astro-ph.SR,"  We present VLT-FORS spectropolarimetric observations of the type II supernova
(SN) 2012aw taken at seven epochs during the photospheric phase, from 16 to
120d after explosion. We correct for the interstellar polarization by
postulating that the SN polarization is naught near the rest wavelength of the
strongest lines - this is later confirmed by our modeling. SN2012aw exhibits
intrinsic polarization, with strong variations across lines, and with a
magnitude that grows in the 7000A line-free region from 0.1% at 16d up to 1.2%
at 120d. This behavior is qualitatively similar to observations gathered for
other type II SNe. A suitable rotation of Stokes vectors places the bulk of the
polarization in q, suggesting the ejecta of SN2012aw is predominantly
axisymmetric. Using an upgraded version of our 2D polarized radiative transfer
code, we model the wavelength- and time-dependent polarization of SN2012aw. The
key observables may be explained by the presence of a confined region of
enhanced 56Ni at ~4000km/s, which boosts the electron density in a cone having
an opening angle of ~50deg and an observer's inclination of ~70deg to the axis
of symmetry. With this fixed asymmetry in time, the observed evolution of the
SN2012aw polarization arises from the evolution of the ejecta optical depth,
ionization, and the relative importance of multiple versus single scattering.
However, the polarization signatures exhibit numerous degeneracies.
Cancellation effects at early times imply that a low polarization may occur for
ejecta with a large asymmetry. An axisymmetric ejecta with a latitude-dependent
explosion energy can also yield similar polarization signatures as an
asymmetric 56Ni distribution. Despite these uncertainties, SN2012aw provides
additional evidence for the generic asymmetry of type II SN ejecta, of which
VLT-FORS spectropolarimetric observations are a decisive and exquisite probe.

we are searching for their embedded stellar populations using FORS at the VLT.
The search is done with single-star photometry in V and I bands, which is
sensitive to both, young and old, stellar populations. Five CHVCs of our sample
have been observed so far down to I=24. We pointed the VLT towards the highest
HI column density regions, as determined in Effelsberg radio data. In an
alternate approach, we searched 2MASS public data towards those 5 CHVCs down to
K=16. While the VLT data probe the central regions out to distance moduli of
about 27, the 2MASS data are sensitive to a population of red giant stars to
distance moduli of about 20. The 2MASS data, on the other hand, cover a much
wider field of view than the VLT data (radius of 1 degree versus FORS field of
6.8 arcmin). We did not find a stellar population intrinsic to the CHVCs in
either data. In this paper, we illustrate our search methods.

imaging of 129 field spiral galaxies within the FORS Deep Field. The galaxies
cover the redshift range 0.1 < z < 1.0 and comprise all types from Sa to
Sdm/Im. Spatially resolved rotation curves were extracted and fitted with
synthetic velocity fields that take into account all geometric (e.g.,
inclination and misalignment) and observational effects (in particular,
blurring due to optical beam smearing and seeing). Using these fits, the
maximum rotation velocity Vmax could be determined for 73 objects. The
Tully-Fisher relation of this sample at a mean look-back time of ~5Gyr shows a
luminosity evolution which amounts to ~2mag in rest-frame B for low-mass
spirals (Vmax~100km/s) but is negligible for high-mass spirals (Vmax~300km/s).
This confirms our previous analysis which was limited to ground-based imaging.
The observed overluminosity of low-mass galaxies is at variance with
predictions from simulations. On the other hand, at given Vmax, we find
slightly smaller disk sizes towards higher redshifts, in compliance with the
CDM hierarchical model. The observed mass-dependent luminosity evolution might
therefore point towards the need for a more realistic modelling of the stellar
(i.e. baryonic) component in N-body codes.

1008-1224 (z=0.30), based on very deep observations obtained using the VLT with
FORS and ISAAC during the science verification phase. We reconstructed the
projected mass distribution from B,V,R,I bands using two different methods
independently. The mass maps are remarkably similar, which confirm that the PSF
correction worked well. The ISAAC and FORS data were combined to measure the
photometric redshifts and constrain the redshift distribution of the lensed
sources. The total mass inferred from weak shear is 2.3 10^{14} h^{-1} Mo on
large scales, in agreement with the X-ray mass. The measured mass profile is
well fit by both Navarro, Frenk and White and isothermal sphere with core
radius models although the NFW is slightly better. In the inner regions, the
lensing mass is about 2 times higher than the X-ray mass, which supports the
view that complex physical processes in the innermost parts of clusters are
responsible for the X-ray/lensing mass discrepancy. The central part of the
cluster is composed of two mass peaks whose the center of mass is 15 arcsecond
north of the cD galaxy. This provides an explanation for the 15 arcsecond
offset between the cD and the center of the X-ray map reported elsewhere. The
optical, X-ray and the mass distributions show that MS 1008-1224 is composed of
many subsystems which are probably undergoing a merger. MS 1008-1224 shows a
remarkable case of cluster-cluster lensing. The photometric redshifts show an
excess of galaxies located 30 arcseconds south-west of the cD galaxy at a
redshift of about 0.9 which is lensed by MS 1008-1224. These results show the

primary optical imaging instruments for the VLT. They are not direct-imaging
instruments, as there are several optical elements in the light path. In
particular, both instruments are attached to a field rotator. Obtaining truly
photometric data with such instruments present a significant challenge. In this
paper, we investigate in detail twilight flats taken with the FORS instruments.
We find that a large fraction of the structure seen in these flatfields rotates
with the field rotator.
  We discuss in detail the methods we use to determine the cause of this
effect. The effect was tracked down to be caused by the Linear Atmospheric
Dispersion Corrector (LADC). The results are thus of special interest for
designers of instruments with LADCs and developers of calibration plans and
pipelines for such instruments. The methods described here to find and correct
it, however, are of interest also for other instruments using a field rotator.
  If not properly corrected, this structure in the flatfield may degrade the
photometric accuracy of imaging observations taken with the FORS instruments by
adding a systematic error of up to 4% for broad band filters. We discuss
several strategies to obtain photometric images in the presence of rotating
flatfield pattern.

physics-informed deep learning methods that utilize Hamiltonian theory as
foundational knowledge within neural networks. However, their direct
application to engineering systems is often challenged by practical issues,
including the presence of external inputs, dissipation, and noisy measurements.
This paper introduces a novel framework that enhances the capabilities of HNNs
to address these real-life factors. We integrate port-Hamiltonian theory into
the neural network structure, allowing for the inclusion of external inputs and
dissipation, while mitigating the impact of measurement noise through an
output-error (OE) model structure. The resulting output error port-Hamiltonian
neural networks (OE-pHNNs) can be adapted to tackle modeling complex
engineering systems with noisy measurements. Furthermore, we propose the
identification of OE-pHNNs based on the subspace encoder approach (SUBNET),
which efficiently approximates the complete simulation loss using subsections
of the data and uses an encoder function to predict initial states. By
integrating SUBNET with OE-pHNNs, we achieve consistent models of complex
engineering systems under noisy measurements. In addition, we perform a
consistency analysis to ensure the reliability of the proposed data-driven
model learning method. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on
system identification benchmarks, showing its potential as a powerful tool for
modeling dynamic systems in real-world applications.

  Streaming QoE over GEO Satellite Networks",cs.NI,"  Geosynchronous satellite (GEO) networks are a crucial option for users beyond
terrestrial connectivity. However, unlike terrestrial networks, GEO networks
exhibit high latency and deploy TCP proxies and traffic shapers. The deployment
of proxies effectively mitigates the impact of high network latency in GEO
networks, while traffic shapers help realize customer-controlled data-saver
options that optimize data usage. It is unclear how the interplay between GEO
networks' high latency, TCP proxies, and traffic-shaping policies affects the
quality of experience (QoE) for commonly used video applications. To fill this
gap, we analyze the quality of over $2$k YouTube video sessions streamed across
a production GEO network with a $900$Kbps shaping rate. Given the average bit
rates for the selected videos, we expected seamless streaming at $360$p or
lower resolutions. However, our analysis reveals that this is not the case:
$28\%$ of TCP sessions and $18\%$ of gQUIC sessions experience rebuffering
events, while the median average resolution is only $380$p for TCP and $299$p
for gQUIC. Our analysis identifies two key factors contributing to sub-optimal
performance: (i)unlike TCP, gQUIC only utilizes $63\%$ of network capacity; and
(ii)YouTube's imperfect chunk request pipelining. As a result of our study, the
partner GEO ISP discontinued support for the low-bandwidth data-saving option
in U.S. business and residential markets to avoid potential degradation of
video quality -- highlighting the practical significance of our findings.

for uncertainty estimation due to the solid theorical foundations. However, the
performance of BNNs is affected by the ability of catching uncertainty. Instead
of only seeking the distribution of neural network weights by in-distribution

Attached structure (ABNN) to catch more uncertainty from out-of-distribution

of OOD data according to the prior distribution, and then develop an attached
Bayesian structure to integrate the uncertainty of OOD data into the backbone
network. ABNN is composed of an expectation module and several distribution
modules. The expectation module is a backbone deep network which focuses on the
original task, and the distribution modules are mini Bayesian structures which
serve as attachments of the backbone. In particular, the distribution modules
aim at extracting the uncertainty from both ID and OOD data. We further provide
theoretical analysis for the convergence of ABNN, and experimentally validate
its superiority by comparing with some state-of-the-art uncertainty estimation

to the existing sampling-based approaches, which are inapplicable to the
infinite time horizon setting, we train a separate deterministic neural network
that serves as an infinite time horizon safety certificate. In particular, we
show that the certificate network guarantees the safety of the system over a
subset of the BNN weight posterior's support. Our method first computes a safe
weight set and then alters the BNN's weight posterior to reject samples outside
this set. Moreover, we show how to extend our approach to a safe-exploration
reinforcement learning setting, in order to avoid unsafe trajectories during
the training of the policy. We evaluate our approach on a series of

primary imaging cameras for the VLT. Since they are not direct-imaging cameras,
the accuracy of photometry which can routinely be obtained is limited by
significant sky concentration and other effects.
  Photometric standard observations are routinely obtained by ESO, and nightly
zero points are computed mainly for the purpose of monitoring the instrument
performance. The accuracy of these zero points is about 10%.
  Recently, we have started a program to investigate, if and how percent-level
absolute photometric accuracy with FORS can be achieved. The main results of
this project are presented in this paper. We first discuss the quality of the
flatfields and how it can be improved. We then use data with improved
flat-fielding to investigate the usefulness of Stetson standard fields for FORS
calibration and the accuracy which can be achieved. The main findings of the
FORS Absolute Photometry Project program are as follows. There are significant
differences between the sky flats and the true photometric response of the
instrument which partially depend on the rotator angle. A second order
correction to the sky flat significantly improves the relative photometry
within the field. Percent level photometric accuracy can be achieved with
FORS1. To achieve this accuracy, observers need to invest some of the assigned
science time for imaging of photometric standard fields in addition to the
routine nightly photometric calibration.

What can be said on the set $\mathbb{G}(f)$ of the interaction graphs of the automata networks isomorphic to $f$? It seems that this simple question has never been studied. In a previous paper, we prove that the complete digraph $K_n$, with $n^2$ arcs, is universal in that $K_n\in \mathbb{G}(f)$ whenever $f$ is not constant nor the identity (and $n\geq 5$). In this paper, taking the opposite direction, we prove that there exist universal automata networks $f$, in that $\mathbb{G}(f)$ contains all the digraphs on $[n]$, excepted the empty one. Actually, we prove that the presence of only three specific digraphs in $\mathbb{G}(f)$ implies the universality of $f$, and we prove that this forces the alphabet size $q$ to have at least $n$ prime factors (with multiplicity). However, we prove that for any fixed $q\geq 3$, there exists almost universal functions, that is, functions $f:Q^n\to Q^n$ such that the probability that a random digraph belongs to $\mathbb{G}(f)$ tends to $1$ as $n\to\infty$.

The technique can help tradeoff safety, size, and precision, in creating

lane keeping controller for an autonomous vehicle and (b) a controller for an

abundances in the host. We probe the geometry of the host by studying the
emission line profiles. Our spectral analysis shows that the star forming
region in the host is metal poor with 12 + log(O/H) = 7.54 (+0.17, -0.10)
(~0.07 Z_sun), placing it among the most metal deficient subset of
emission-line galaxies. It is also the lowest metallicity found so far for a
GRB host from an emission-line analysis. Given the stellar mass of the galaxy
of ~10^7 M_sun and the SFR (H alpha) = 0.065 +/- 0.005 M_sun/yr, the high
specific star formation rate indicates an age for the galaxy of less than ~200
Myr. The brightest emission lines are clearly asymmetric and are well fit by
two Gaussian components separated by ~22$ km/s. We detect two discrete Na I and
Ca II absorption components at the same redshifts as the emission components.
We tentatively interpret the two components as arising from two different
starforming regions in the host, but high resolution imaging is necessary to
confirm this.

dispersion Spectrographs FORS 1 and FORS 2 in spectropolarimetric mode revealed
the presence of strong line profile variations (LPV) in spectra of magnetic OBA
stars. More specifically, we detected moderate line profile variations of
selected lines on a time scale of minutes in FORS 2 spectra of the A0
supergiant HD 92207 (Hubrig et al. 2014). Recently, we investigated the
variability of line profiles of selected OBA stars with the multi-mode focal
reducer SCORPIO at the 6-meter BTA telescope. We discovered regular variations
of H and He lines in the spectra of the O-type star HD 93521 (O9.5III) with
periods ~4-5 and ~32-36 minutes. The possible origin of short time-scale
spectral variations is discussed.

  solar-type background star CPD -83$^{\circ}$ 64B",astro-ph.SR,"  HD 21190 is a known $\delta$ Scuti star showing Ap star characteristics and a
variability period of 3.6 h discovered by the Hipparcos mission. Using Gaia DR1
data for an astrometric analysis, it was recently suggested that HD 21190 forms
a physical binary system with the companion CPD -83$^{\circ}$ 64B. An
atmospheric chemical analysis based on HARPS observations revealed the presence
of overabundances of heavy and rare-earth elements, which are typically
observed in chemically peculiar stars with large-scale organized magnetic
fields. Previous observations of HD 21190 indicated a magnetic field strength
of a few hundred Gauss. The presence of a magnetic field in CPD -83$^{\circ}$
64B remained unexplored. In this work, we reanalyse this system using Gaia DR2
data and present our search for the magnetic field in both stars based on
multi-epoch HARPSpol high-resolution and FORS 2 low-resolution
spectropolarimetric observations. The Gaia DR2 results clearly indicate that
the two star are not physically associated. A magnetic field detection at a
significance level of more than 6$\sigma$ ($\left< B_{\rm z}\right>_{\rm
all}=230\pm38$ G) was achieved for the $\delta$ Scuti variable HD 21190 in FORS
2 observations using the entire spectrum for the measurements. The magnetic
field appears to be stronger in CPD -83$^{\circ}$ 64B. The highest value for
the longitudinal magnetic field in CPD -83$^{\circ}$ 64B, $\left< B_{\rm
z}\right>_{\rm all}=509\pm104$ G, is measured at a significance level of
4.9$\sigma$. Furthermore, the high-resolution HARPS\-pol observations of this
component indicate the presence of pulsational variability on a time scale of
tens of minutes.

cellular networks toward continual assessment, proactive management, and
what-if analysis. Existing discussions have been focusing on using only deep
learning techniques to build DNTs, which raises widespread concerns regarding
their generalization, explainability, and transparency. In this paper, we
explore an alternative approach to augment network simulators with
context-aware neural agents. The main challenge lies in the non-trivial
simulation-to-reality (sim-to-real) discrepancy between offline simulators and
real-world networks. To solve the challenge, we propose a new learn-to-bridge
algorithm to cost-efficiently bridge the sim-to-real discrepancy in two
alternative stages. In the first stage, we select states to query performances
in real-world networks by using newly-designed cost-aware Bayesian
optimization. In the second stage, we train the neural agent to learn the state
context and bridge the probabilistic discrepancy based on Bayesian neural
networks (BNN). In addition, we build a small-scale end-to-end network testbed
based on OpenAirInterface RAN and Core with USRP B210 and a smartphone, and
replicate the network in NS-3. The evaluation results show that, our proposed
solution substantially outperforms existing methods, with more than 92\%
reduction in the sim-to-real discrepancy.

integrated on all types of platforms, from data centers to embedded systems
including low-power processors and, recently, FPGAs. Neural Networks (NN) are
expected to become ubiquitous in IoT systems by transforming all sorts of
real-world applications, including applications in the safety-critical and
security-sensitive domains. However, the underlying hardware security
vulnerabilities of embedded NN implementations remain unaddressed. In
particular, embedded DNN implementations are vulnerable to Side-Channel
Analysis (SCA) attacks, which are especially important in the IoT and edge
computing contexts where an attacker can usually gain physical access to the
targeted device. A research field has therefore emerged and is rapidly growing
in terms of the use of SCA including timing, electromagnetic attacks and power
attacks to target NN embedded implementations. Since 2018, research papers have
shown that SCA enables an attacker to recover inference models architectures
and parameters, to expose industrial IP and endangers data confidentiality and
privacy. Without a complete review of this emerging field in the literature so
far, this paper surveys state-of-the-art physical SCA attacks relative to the
implementation of embedded DNNs on micro-controllers and FPGAs in order to
provide a thorough analysis on the current landscape. It provides a taxonomy
and a detailed classification of current attacks. It first discusses mitigation
techniques and then provides insights for future research leads.

One form of coordination is to solve the overall system operation problem in a hierarchical way, computing Feasible Operational Regions (FORs) for the interconnection between TSO/DSO. Most methods for computing FORs rely on the assumption of only one interconnection point between TSO and DSOs, which is often violated in practice. In this work, we propose a method for computing FORs in distribution grids with multiple interconnection points to the transmission grid. We test our method in a grid with two interconnecting points and analyze the properties of the resulting high-dimensional FOR from a power systems perspective."

  Radio Networks",cs.NI,"  In many cognitive radio applications, there are multiple types of message
queues. Existing queueing analysis works in underlay CR networks failed to
discuss packets heterogeneity. Therefore high priority packets with impatient
waiting time that have preemptive transmission opportunities over low class are
investigated. We model the system behavior as a M/M/1+GI queue which is
represented by a two dimensional state transition graph. The reneging
probability of high priority packets and the average waiting time in two-class
priority queues is analyzed. Simulation results demonstrate that the average
waiting time of high priority packets decreases with the growing interference
power threshold and the average waiting time of the low priority packet is
proportional to the arrival rate of the high priority packet. This work may lay
the foundation to design efficient MAC protocols and optimize long term system
performance by carefully choosing system parameters.

  of the nebula from VLT/FORS polarimetry",astro-ph.SR astro-ph.GA,"  The long-period Cepheid RS Pup is surrounded by a large dusty nebula
reflecting the light from the central star. Due to the changing luminosity of
the central source, light echoes propagate into the nebula. This remarkable
phenomenon was the subject of Paper I.The origin and physical properties of the
nebula are however uncertain: it may have been created through mass loss from
the star itself, or it could be the remnant of a pre-existing interstellar
cloud. Our goal is to determine the 3D structure of the nebula, and estimate
its mass. Knowing the geometrical shape of the nebula will also allow us to
retrieve the distance of RS Pup in an unambiguous manner using a model of its
light echoes (in a forthcoming work). The scattering angle of the Cepheid light
in the circumstellar nebula can be recovered from its degree of linear
polarization. We thus observed the nebula surrounding RS Pup using the
polarimetric imaging mode of the VLT/FORS instrument, and obtained a map of the
degree and position angle of linear polarization. From our FORS observations,
we derive a 3D map of the distribution of the dust, whose overall geometry is
an irregular and thin layer. The nebula does not present a well-defined
symmetry. Using a simple model, we derive a total dust mass of M(dust) = 2.9
+/- 0.9 Msun for the dust within 1.8 arcmin of the Cepheid. This translates
into a total mass of M(gas+dust) = 290 +/- 120 Msun, assuming a dust-to-gas
ratio of 1.0 +/- 0.3 %. The high mass of the dusty nebula excludes that it was
created by mass-loss from the star. However, the thinness nebula is an
indication that the Cepheid participated to its shaping, e.g. through its
radiation pressure or stellar wind. RS Pup therefore appears as a regular
long-period Cepheid located in an exceptionally dense interstellar environment.

  more years of operations",astro-ph.IM,"  The FORS Upgrade project (FORS-Up) aims at bringing a new life to the highly
demanded workhorse instrument attached to ESO's Very Large Telescope (VLT).
FORS2 is a multimode optical instrument, which started regular science
operations in 2000 and since then, together with its twin, FORS1, has been one
of the most demanded and most productive instruments of the VLT. In order to
ensure that a FORS shall remain operational for at least another 15 years, an
upgrade has been planned. This is required as FORS2 is using technology and
software that is now obsolete and cannot be put and maintained to the standards
in use at the Observatory. The project - carried out as a collaboration between
ESO and INAF-Astronomical Observatory of Trieste - aims at bringing to the
telescope in 2023/2024 a refurbished instrument with a new scientific detector,
an upgrade of the instrument control software and electronics, a new
calibration unit, as well as additional filters and grisms. The new FORS will
also serve as a test bench for the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) standard
technologies (among them the use of programmable logic controllers and of the
features of the ELT Control Software). The project aims at minimising the
downtime of the instrument by performing the upgrade on the currently
decommissioned instrument FORS1 and retrofitting the Mask Exchange Unit and
polarisation optics from FORS2 to FORS1.

  operational management",eess.SY cs.SY,"  Aggregated flexibilities or PQ-capabilities (active and reactive power
capabilities) are termed in literature as Feasible Operating Regions (FORs).
The FORs from underlying active distribution grids can effectively contribute
to the operational management at the HV grid level. The HV buses are allocated
aggregated FORs from the underlying MV grids, which are inherently nonlinear
and non-convex. Therefore, two approaches are proposed in the paper to apply
the FOR constraints in the HV grid operational management. First, a mixed
integer linear programming (MILP) based optimization approach for alleviating
the HV grid constraint violations is proposed, which addresses the
non-convexity of the FOR using piecewise segmentation. Furthermore, the MILP
method is enhanced to consider the influence of the HV bus voltage on the
underlying MV grid flexibilities resulting in a three dimensional PQ(V)-FOR.
Second, a convexification approach is proposed, which uses a convex
approximation of the non-convex 3D PQ(V)-FOR shape for implementation in a
linear optimization method. Results reveal a robust utilization of the
distribution flexibilities to maintain grid security and reliability at the HV
grid level. Comparisons present increased computation times for the MILP method
which are significantly improved using the convexification based approach.
