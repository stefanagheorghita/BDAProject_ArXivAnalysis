quantum_field,quantum field theory gauge symmetry,1,1110.1176,0.8293875,Classical gauge gravitation theory,math-ph gr-qc math.MP,"  Classical gravitation theory is formulated as gauge theory on natural bundles
where gauge symmetries are general covariant transformations and a
gravitational field is a Higgs field responsible for their spontaneous symmetry
breaking.
"
quantum_field,quantum field theory gauge symmetry,2,hep-th/0602185,0.8290782,Twist to close,hep-th,"  It has been proposed that the Poincare and some other symmetries of
noncommutative field theories should be twisted. Here we extend this idea to
gauge transformations and find that twisted gauge symmetries close for
arbitrary gauge group. We also analyse twisted-invariant actions in
noncommutative theories.

quantum_field,quantum field theory gauge symmetry,3,1310.8164,0.82000995,Gauge fields beyond perturbation theory,hep-th,"  A new formulation of nonabelian gauge theories, introducing new ghost fields
and new symmetry is proposed. This formulation does not suffer from Gribov
ambiguity and allows to quantize nonabelian gauge fields beyond perturbation
theory.
"
quantum_field,quantum field theory gauge symmetry,4,1302.3183,0.818429,Lattice BRST without Neuberger 0/0 problem,hep-th hep-lat,"  We illustrate in a simple toy model how the methods of SUSY quantum mechanics
and topological quantum field theory can be used for covariant gauge-fixing
with unbroken BRST symmetry on a finite lattice.

quantum_field,quantum field theory gauge symmetry,5,0711.4091,0.81541044,Symmetries in noncommutative field theories: Hopf versus Lie,hep-th,"  I discuss motivations for introducing Hopf algebra symmetries in
noncommutative field theories and briefly describe twisting of main symmetry
transformations. New results include an extended list of twisted gauge
invariants (which may help to overcome the problem of inconsistency of
equations of motion) and a gauge-covariant twist operator (leading to a
gauge-covariant star product).
"
quantum_field,quantum field theory gauge symmetry,6,1611.08856,0.81266,Gauge Fixing Invariance and Anti-BRST Symmetry,hep-th,"  It is shown that anti-BRST invariance in quantum gauge theories can be
considered as the quantized version of the symmetry of classical gauge theories
with respect to different gauge fixing mechanisms.
"
quantum_field,quantum field theory gauge symmetry,7,1602.06776,0.8103095,Lecture on Gauge Gravitation Theory. Gravity as a Higgs Field,math-ph gr-qc hep-th math.MP,"  Gravitation theory is formulated as gauge theory on natural bundles with
spontaneous symmetry breaking where gauge symmetries are general covariant
transformations, gauge fields are general linear connections, and Higgs fields
are pseudo-Riemannian metrics.
"
quantum_field,quantum field theory gauge symmetry,8,0802.2382,0.8075937,Mathematical models of spontaneous symmetry breaking,math-ph math.MP,"  The Higgs mechanism of mass generation is the main ingredient in the
contemporary Standard Model and its various generalizations. However, there is
no comprehensive theory of spontaneous symmetry breaking. We summarize the
relevant mathematical results characterizing spontaneous symmetry breaking
phenomena in algebraic quantum theory, axiomatic quantum field theory, group
theory, and classical gauge theory.

quantum_field,quantum field theory gauge symmetry,9,1612.02612,0.8042072,Off-Shell Covariantization of Algebroid Gauge Theories,hep-th math-ph math.MP,"  We present a generalized method to construct field strengths and gauge
symmetries, which yield a Yang-Mills type action with Lie n-algebroid gauge
symmetry. The procedure makes use of off-shell covariantization in a
supergeometric setting. We apply this method to the system of a 1-form gauge
field and scalar fields with Lie n-algebroid gauge symmetry. We work out some
characteristic examples.
"
quantum_field,quantum field theory gauge symmetry,10,1006.1039,0.8034327,Theories on noncommutative spaces and deformed symmetries,hep-th,"  In this thesis we study different aspects of noncommutativity in quantum
mechanics, field theory and gravity. We give particular emphasis on the
underlying symmetries of these theories. Deformations of usual symmetries like
the external space time symmetries and the internal gauge symmetry in
noncommutative theories are analyzed in detail.
