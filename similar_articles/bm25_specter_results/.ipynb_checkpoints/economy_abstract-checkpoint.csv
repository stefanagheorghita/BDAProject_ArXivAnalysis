Building on our previous studies, which establish Navier-Stokes-based approaches to spatial treatment effects and financial network fragility, we demonstrate that technology adoption spreads simultaneously through both geographic proximity and supply chain connections. Using comprehensive data on six technologies adopted by 500 firms over 2010-2023, we document three key findings. First, technology adoption exhibits strong exponential geographic decay with spatial decay rate $\kappa \approx 0.043$ per kilometer, implying a spatial boundary of $d^* \approx 69$ kilometers beyond which spillovers are negligible (R-squared = 0.99). Second, supply chain connections create technology-specific networks whose algebraic connectivity ($\lambda_2$) increases 300-380 percent as adoption spreads, with correlation between $\lambda_2$ and adoption exceeding 0.95 across all technologies. Third, traditional difference-in-differences methods that ignore spatial and network structure exhibit 61 percent bias in estimated treatment effects. An event study around COVID-19 reveals that network fragility increased 24.5 percent post-shock, amplifying treatment effects through supply chain spillovers in a manner analogous to financial contagion documented in our recent study. Our framework provides micro-foundations for technology policy: interventions have spatial reach of 69 kilometers and network amplification factor of 10.8, requiring coordinated geographic and supply chain targeting for optimal effectiveness."

We develop a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) integrated with boundary detection methods from stochastic process theory to identify when and how treatment effects propagate beyond local markets. Our approach treats the evolution of spatial spillovers as a L\'evy process with jump-diffusion dynamics, where the first passage time to critical thresholds indicates regime shifts from partial to general equilibrium. Using CUSUM-based sequential detection, we identify the spatial and temporal boundaries at which local interventions become systemic. Applied to AI adoption across Japanese prefectures, we find that treatment effects exhibit L\'evy jumps at approximately 35km spatial scales, with general equilibrium effects amplifying partial equilibrium estimates by 42\%. Monte Carlo simulations show that ignoring these stochastic boundaries leads to underestimation of treatment effects by 28-67\%, with particular severity in densely connected economic regions. Our framework provides the first rigorous method for determining when spatial spillovers necessitate general equilibrium analysis, offering crucial guidance for policy evaluation in interconnected economies."

Previous studies have extensively examined pairwise transmission and local reinforcement. However, the role of macro-level social influence -- where widespread adoption enhances further adoption -- remains understudied. Here, we focus on a contagion process that incorporates both pairwise interactions and macro-level reinforcement. We show that the contagion undergoes a shift from continuous to mixed-order transition as macro-level influence exceeds a reinforcement threshold. Simulations on various real-world networks indicate that network localization governs the contagion outcomes by determining the critical point and the reinforcement threshold. Building on this insight, we develop a structural metric linking network localization to contagion dynamics, revealing a key trade-off: networks that facilitate weak contagion tend to experience slower diffusion and lower adoption rates, while networks that suppress weak contagions enable faster and more widespread adoption. These findings challenge the conventional belief that stronger local connectivity uniformly promotes contagion."

as a spreading process driven to large extent by social influence and
conditioned by the needs and capacities of individuals. To model this process
one usually introduces behavioural threshold mechanisms, which can give rise to
the evolution of global cascades if the system satisfies a set of conditions.
However, these models do not address temporal aspects of the emerging cascades,
which in real systems may evolve through various pathways ranging from slow to
rapid patterns. Here we fill this gap through the analysis and modelling of
product adoption in the world's largest voice over internet service, the social
network of Skype. We provide empirical evidence about the heterogeneous
distribution of fractional behavioural thresholds, which appears to be
independent of the degree of adopting egos. We show that the structure of
real-world adoption clusters is radically different from previous theoretical
expectations, since vulnerable adoptions --induced by a single adopting
neighbour-- appear to be important only locally, while spontaneous adopters
arriving at a constant rate and the involvement of unconcerned individuals
govern the global emergence of social spreading.

  Innovation",physics.soc-ph cs.SI econ.GN q-fin.EC,"  When multiple innovations compete for adoption, historical chance leading to
early advantage can generate lock-in effects that allow suboptimal innovations
to succeed at the expense of superior alternatives. Research on the diffusion
of innovafacetion has identified many possible sources of early advantage, but
these mechanisms can benefit both optimal and suboptimal innovations. This
paper moves beyond chance-as-explanation to identify structural principles that
systematically impact the likelihood that the optimal strategy will spread. A
formal model of innovation diffusion shows that the network structure of
organizational relationships can systematically impact the likelihood that
widely adopted innovations will be payoff optimal. Building on prior diffusion
research, this paper focuses on the role of central actors i.e. well-connected
people or firms. While contagion models of diffusion highlight the benefits of
central actors for spreading innovations further and faster, the present
analysis reveals a dark side to this influence: the mere presence of central
actors in a network increases rates of adoption but also increases the
likelihood of suboptimal outcomes. This effect, however, does not represent a
speed-optimality tradeoff, as dense networks are both fast and optimal. This
finding is consistent with related research showing that network centralization
undermines collective intelligence.

the social interactions of individuals in a population. The Bass diffusion
model has been widely used to model the temporal evolution of adoption in such
social systems. In the model, the likelihood of a new adoption is proportional
to the number of previous adopters, implicitly assuming a global (or
homogeneous) interaction among all individuals in the network. Such global
interactions do not exist in many large social networks, however. Instead,
individuals typically interact with a small part of the larger population. To
quantify the growth rate (or equivalently the adoption timing) in networks with
limited interactions, we study a stochastic adoption process where the
likelihood that each individual adopts is proportional to the number of
adopters among the small group of persons he/she interacts with (and not the
entire population of adopters). When the underlying network of interactions is
a random $k$-regular graph, we compute the sample path limit of the fraction of
adopters. We show the limit coincides with the solution of a differential
equation which can viewed as a generalization of the Bass diffusion model. When
the degree $k$ is bounded, we show the adoption curve differs significantly
from the one corresponds to the Bass diffusion model. In particular, the
adoption grows more slowly than what the Bass model projects. In addition, the
adoption curve is asymmetric, unlike that of the Bass diffusion model. Such
asymmetry has important consequences for the estimation of market potential.
Finally, we calculate the timing of early adoptions at finer scales, e.g.,
logarithmic in the population size.

We formalize the concept of treatment effect boundaries as structural parameters characterizing regime transitions where causal effects cease to operate. Building on reaction-diffusion models of information propagation, we establish conditions under which spatial and temporal boundaries share common dynamics governed by diffusion parameters (delta, lambda), yielding the testable prediction d^*/tau^* = 3.32 lambda sqrt{delta} for standard detection thresholds. We derive formal identification results under staggered treatment adoption and develop a three-stage estimation procedure implementable with standard panel data. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate excellent finite-sample performance, with boundary estimates achieving RMSE below 10% in realistic configurations. We apply the framework to two empirical settings: EU broadband diffusion (2006-2021) and US wildfire economic impacts (2017-2022). The broadband application reveals a scope limitation -- our framework assumes depreciation dynamics and fails when effects exhibit increasing returns through network externalities. The wildfire application provides strong validation: estimated boundaries satisfy d^* = 198 km and tau^* = 2.7 years, with the empirical ratio (72.5) exactly matching the theoretical prediction 3.32 lambda sqrt{delta} = 72.5. The framework provides practical tools for detecting when localized treatments become systemic and identifying critical thresholds for policy intervention."

network. To infer the network topology, a \textit{dynamic} structural equation
model is adopted to capture the relationship between observed adoption times
and the unknown edge weights. Assuming a slowly time-varying topology and
leveraging the sparse connectivity inherent to social networks, edge weights
are estimated by minimizing a sparsity-regularized exponentially-weighted
least-squares criterion. To this end, solvers with complementary strengths are
developed by leveraging (pseudo) real-time sparsity-promoting proximal gradient
iterations, the improved convergence rate of accelerated variants, or reduced
computational complexity of stochastic gradient descent. Numerical tests with
both synthetic and real data demonstrate the effectiveness of the novel
algorithms in unveiling sparse dynamically-evolving topologies, while
accounting for external influences in the adoption times. Key events in the

of the individual's social network. The micro-model was used to simulate
macro-level diffusion patterns emerging from different configurations of
micro-model parameters. Micro-level simulation results matched very closely the
adoption patterns predicted by the widely-used Bass macro-level model (Bass,
1969). For a portion of the domain, results from micro-simulations were
consistent with aggregate-level adoption patterns reported in the literature.
Induced Bass macro-level parameters and responded to changes in
micro-parameters: (1) increased with the number of innovators and with the rate
at which innovators are introduced; (2) increased with the probability of
rewiring in small-world networks, as the characteristic path length decreases;
and (3) an increase in the overall perceived utility of an innovation caused a
corresponding increase in induced and values. Understanding micro to macro
linkages can inform the design and assessment of marketing interventions on

behaviors are adopted. In widely-used models of biological contagion,
interventions that randomly rewire edges (on average making them ""longer"")
accelerate spread. However, there are other models relevant to social
contagion, such as those motivated by myopic best-response in games with
strategic complements, in which an individual's behavior is described by a
threshold number of adopting neighbors above which adoption occurs (i.e.,
complex contagions). Recent work has argued that highly clustered, rather than
random, networks facilitate spread of these complex contagions. Here we show
that minor modifications to this model, which make it more realistic, reverse
this result, thereby harmonizing qualitative facts about how network structure
affects contagion. To model the trade-off between long and short edges we
analyze the rate of spread over networks that are the union of circular
lattices and random graphs on $n$ nodes. Allowing for noise in adoption
decisions (i.e., adoptions below threshold) to occur with order
${n}^{-1/\theta}$ probability along at least some ""short"" cycle edges is enough
to ensure that random rewiring accelerates the spread of a noisy
threshold-$\theta$ contagion. This conclusion also holds under partial but
frequent enough rewiring and when adoption decisions are reversible but
infrequently so, as well as in high-dimensional lattice structures that
facilitate faster-expanding contagions. Simulations illustrate the robustness
of these results to several variations on this noisy best-response behavior.
Hypothetical interventions that randomly rewire existing edges or add random
edges (versus adding ""short"", triad-closing edges) in hundreds of empirical
social networks reduce time to spread.

accurate predictions of a social contagion and technology adoption at the city

real geographic space and exposes individuals to mass media influence. We show
that homopholy both amongst individuals with similar propensities to adopt a
technology and geographic location are critical to reproduce features of real
spatiotemporal adoption. Furthermore, we estimate that mass media was
responsible for increasing Twitter's user base two to four fold. To reflect
this strength, we extend traditional contagion models to include an endogenous
mass media agent that responds to those adopting an innovation as well as
influencing agents to adopt themselves.

departure from the standard model, we model a trickle-up process by introducing

erratic generation of innovation at the periphery of the network. The results
confirm the robustness of the Bass model and expand considerably its range of

service is commonly interpreted as a spreading phenomenon throughout the fabric
of society. This process is arguably driven by social influence, social
learning and by external effects like media. Observations of such processes
date back to the seminal studies by Rogers and Bass, and their mathematical
modelling has taken two directions: One paradigm, called simple contagion,
identifies adoption spreading with an epidemic process. The other one, named
complex contagion, is concerned with behavioural thresholds and successfully
explains the emergence of large cascades of adoption resulting in a rapid
spreading often seen in empirical data. The observation of real world adoption
processes has become easier lately due to the availability of large digital
social network and behavioural datasets. This has allowed simultaneous study of
network structures and dynamics of online service adoption, shedding light on
the mechanisms and external effects that influence the temporal evolution of
behavioural or innovation adoption. These advancements have induced the
development of more realistic models of social spreading phenomena, which in
turn have provided remarkably good predictions of various empirical adoption
processes. In this chapter we review recent data-driven studies addressing
real-world service adoption processes. Our studies provide the first detailed
empirical evidence of a heterogeneous threshold distribution in adoption. We
also describe the modelling of such phenomena with formal methods and
data-driven simulations. Our objective is to understand the effects of
identified social mechanisms on service adoption spreading, and to provide
potential new directions and open questions for future research.

real-world collective behavior, such as the contagious spread of fads and the
adoption of new technologies. A common property of those cascade models is that
a vanishingly small seed fraction can spread to a finite fraction of an
infinitely large network through local infections.
  In social and economic networks, however, individuals' behavior is often
influenced not only by what their direct neighbors are doing, but also by what
the majority of people are doing as a trend. A trend affects individuals'
behavior while individuals' behavior creates a trend.
  To analyze such a complex interplay between local- and global-scale
phenomena, I generalize the standard threshold model by introducing a new type
of node, called \textit{global nodes} (or \textit{trend followers}), whose
activation probability depends on a global-scale trend; specifically the
percentage of activated nodes in the population. The model shows that global
nodes play a role as accelerating cascades once a trend emerges while reducing
the probability of a trend emerging. Global nodes thus either facilitate or
inhibit cascades, suggesting that a moderate share of trend followers may
maximize the average size of cascades.

is the efficient estimation choice, however, it is not always a feasible one.
In network diffusion models with unobserved signal propagation, MLE requires
integrating out a large number of latent variables, which quickly becomes
computationally infeasible even for moderate network sizes and time horizons.
Limiting the model time horizon on the other hand entails loss of important
information while approximation techniques entail a (small) error that.
Searching for a viable alternative is thus potentially highly beneficial. This
paper proposes two estimators specifically tailored to the network diffusion
model of partially observed adoption and unobserved network diffusion.

behaviors are adopted in a population. These models typically lead to a
continuous or a discontinuous phase transition of the number of adopters as a
function of a control parameter. We explore a simple model of social adoption
where the agents can be in two states, either adopters or non-adopters, and can
switch between these two states interacting with other agents through a
network. The probability of an agent to switch from non-adopter to adopter
depends on the number of adopters in her network neighborhood, the adoption
threshold $T$ and the adoption coefficient $a$, two parameters defining a Hill
function. In contrast, the transition from adopter to non-adopter is
spontaneous at a certain rate $\mu$. In a mean-field approach, we derive the
governing ordinary differential equations and show that the nature of the
transition between the global non-adoption and global adoption regimes depends
mostly on the balance between the probability to adopt with one and two
adopters. The transition changes from continuous, via a transcritical
bifurcation, to discontinuous, via a combination of a saddle-node and a
transcritical bifurcation, through a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation. We
characterize the full parameter space. Finally, we compare our analytical
results with Montecarlo simulations on annealed and quenched degree regular
networks, showing a better agreement for the annealed case. Our results show
how a simple model is able to capture two seemingly very different types of
transitions, i.e., continuous and discontinuous and thus unifies underlying
dynamics for different systems. Furthermore the form of the adoption
probability used here is based on empirical measurements.

community structure. In this model, individuals adopt the new behavior based on
how many neighbors have already chosen it. Specifically, we consider the
permanent adoption model wherein individuals that have adopted the new behavior
(or opinion) cannot change their state. We present a
differential-equation-based tight approximation to the stochastic process of
adoption and prove the validity of the mean-field equations. In addition, we
characterize both necessary and sufficient conditions for contagion to happen
no matter how small the set of initial adopters is. Finally, we study the
problem of optimum seeding given budget constraints and propose a
gradient-based heuristic seeding strategy. Our algorithm, numerically, dispels
commonly held beliefs in the literature that suggest the best seeding strategy
is to seed over the vertices with the highest number of neighbors.

governed by the impact of media and social interactions. Although these
mechanisms have been identified by quantitative theories, their role and
relative importance are not entirely understood, since empirical verification
has so far been hindered by the lack of appropriate data. Here we analyse a
dataset recording the spreading dynamics of the world's largest Voice over
Internet Protocol service to empirically support the assumptions behind models
of social contagion. We show that the rate of spontaneous service adoption is
constant, the probability of adoption via social influence is linearly
proportional to the fraction of adopting neighbours, and the rate of service
termination is time-invariant and independent of the behaviour of peers. By
implementing the detected diffusion mechanisms into a dynamical agent-based
model, we are able to emulate the adoption dynamics of the service in several
countries worldwide. This approach enables us to make medium-term predictions
of service adoption and disclose dependencies between the dynamics of
innovation spreading and the socioeconomic development of a country.

social entity will adopt a product, service, or opinion in the foreseeable
future. Such probabilities are central to fundamental issues in social network
analysis, including the influence maximization problem. In practice, adoption
probabilities have significant implications for applications ranging from
social network-based target marketing to political campaigns; yet, predicting
adoption probabilities has not received sufficient research attention. Building
on relevant social network theories, we identify and operationalize key factors
that affect adoption decisions: social influence, structural equivalence,
entity similarity, and confounding factors. We then develop the
locally-weighted expectation-maximization method for Na\""ive Bayesian learning
to predict adoption probabilities on the basis of these factors. The principal
challenge addressed in this study is how to predict adoption probabilities in
the presence of confounding factors that are generally unobserved. Using data
from two large-scale social networks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method. The empirical results also suggest that cascade methods
primarily using social influence to predict adoption probabilities offer
limited predictive power, and that confounding factors are critical to adoption
probability predictions.
