text,Neutrino decays as a natural explanation of the neutrino mass tension,3,1408.2864,0.8944579362869263,Neutrino oscillations: brief history and present status,hep-ph,"  A brief review of the problem of neutrino masses and oscillations is given.
In the beginning we present an early history of neutrino masses, mixing and
oscillations. Then we discuss all possibilities of neutrino masses and mixing
(neutrino mass terms). The phenomenology of neutrino oscillations in vacuum is
considered in some details. We present also the neutrino oscillation data and
the seesaw mechanism of the neutrino mass generation.

text,Neutrino decays as a natural explanation of the neutrino mass tension,4,hep-ph/9402355,0.8942708969116211,Solar and atmospheric neutrinos,hep-ph,"  Possible explanations of solar neutrino and atmospheric neutrino anomalies
are summarized and future tests discussed.

text,Neutrino decays as a natural explanation of the neutrino mass tension,5,1207.2167,0.8899166584014893,Tensions with the Three-Neutrino Paradigm,hep-ph,"  We review the tensions with the standard three-neutrino framework for
neutrino oscillation. These tensions hint at the possible existence of sterile
neutrinos. We briefly describe some of the diverse ideas for probing the
existence of such neutrinos in a definitive way through future experiments.

neutrinos can be accounted for by neutrino decay. Furthermore, it is possible
to account for all neutrino anomalies with just three flavors.
"
text,Neutrino decays as a natural explanation of the neutrino mass tension,7,hep-ph/9402229,0.8865153789520264,Naturally Degenerate Neutrinos,hep-ph,"  The solar neutrino problem, atmospheric neutrino problem, and the existence
of hot dark matter can all be economically accounted for using only the three
known neutrinos if these neutrinos all have nearly degenerate masses of a few
eV. We show how to generate this pattern of neutrino masses in a natural way
within a `see-saw' framework.

text,Neutrino decays as a natural explanation of the neutrino mass tension,8,1108.2694,0.8858439922332764,Neutrinos and the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe,hep-ph,"  The discovery of neutrino oscillations provides a solid evidence for nonzero
neutrino masses and leptonic mixing. The fact that neutrino masses are so tiny
constitutes a puzzling problem in particle physics. From the theoretical
viewpoint, the smallness of neutrino masses can be elegantly explained through
the seesaw mechanism. Another challenging issue for particle physics and
cosmology is the explanation of the matter-antimatter asymmetry observed in
Nature. Among the viable mechanisms, leptogenesis is a simple and
well-motivated framework. In this talk we briefly review these aspects, making
emphasis on the possibility of linking neutrino physics to the cosmological
baryon asymmetry originated from leptogenesis.

text,Neutrino decays as a natural explanation of the neutrino mass tension,9,hep-ph/9808293,0.8851426839828491,Neutrinos on Earth and in the Heavens,hep-ph,"  Recent data lead us to a simple and intriguing form of the neutrino mass
matrix. In particular, we find solar neutrino oscillations to be nearly maximal
(and rule out the small-angle MSW explanation of solar neutrino observations)
if relic neutrinos comprise at least one~percent of the critical mass density
of the universe.

small but nonzero masses. They further suggest that mass eigenvalues have
certain degree of hierarchical structures, and also some mixing angles are
near-maximal while the others are small. We first survey possible explanations
for the smallness of neutrino masses. We then discuss some models in which the
hierarchical pattern of neutrino masses and mixing angles arises as a
consequence of U(1) flavor symmetries which would explain also the hierarchical
quark and charged lepton masses.

text,Neutrino decays as a natural explanation of the neutrino mass tension,11,hep-ph/0110001,0.881388783454895,Leptogenesis and Low-energy Observables,hep-ph,"  We relate leptogenesis in a class of theories to low-energy experimental
observables: quark and lepton masses and mixings. With reasonable assumptions
motivated by grand unification, one can show that the CP-asymmetry parameter
takes a universal form. Furthermore the dilution mass is related to the light
neutrino masses. Overall, these models offer a natural explanation for a lepton
asymmetry in the early universe.

text,Neutrino decays as a natural explanation of the neutrino mass tension,12,hep-ph/9906244,0.880730390548706,Neutrino Mass and Oscillation,hep-ph hep-ex,"  The question of neutrino mass is one of the major riddles in particle
physics. Recently, strong evidence that neutrinos have nonzero masses has been
found. While tiny, these masses could be large enough to contribute
significantly to the mass density of the universe. The evidence for
nonvanishing neutrino masses is based on the apparent observation of neutrino
oscillation -- the transformation of a neutrino of one type or ""flavor"" into
one of another. We explain the physics of neutrino oscillation, and review and
weigh the evidence that it actually occurs in nature. We also discuss the
constraints on neutrino mass from cosmology and from experiments with negative
results. After presenting illustrative neutrino mass spectra suggested by the
present data, we consider how near- and far-future experiments can further
illuminate the nature of neutrinos and their masses.

text,Neutrino decays as a natural explanation of the neutrino mass tension,13,hep-ex/9902027,0.8802270293235779,News on Neutrino Oscillations and Neutrino Masses,hep-ex,"  Recent results on neutrino oscillations and neutrino masses are presented.
The most exciting news are the Super-Kamiokande measurements of atmospheric
neutrinos, which show evidence for the neutrinos being massive. Various
possible schemes for the neutrino masses are discussed.

text,Neutrino decays as a natural explanation of the neutrino mass tension,14,hep-ph/0411010,0.878890872001648,Seesaw and the Riddle of Mass,hep-ph,"  The prediction of small neutrino masses through the Seesaw Mechanism and
their subsequent measurement suggests that the natural cut-off of the Standard
Model is very high indeed. The recent neutrino data must be interpreted as a
reflection of physics at very high energy. We examine their implications in
terms of ideas of Grand Unification and Supersymmetry, and as possible hints
for a unified theory of flavor.

particles and their tiny masses originate from a one-loop radiative diagram.
The new fields required by the neutrino mass-generation also accommodate the
explanation for the matter-antimatter asymmetry and dark matter in the
universe.

  Oscillations",hep-ph,"  We introduce a simple flavor symmetry breaking scheme, in which charged
lepton masses have a strong hierarchy and neutrino masses are almost
degenerate. It is possible to obtain a natural suppression of lepton flavor
mixing between the 1st and 3rd families as well as the approximate decoupling
of atmospheric and solar neutrino oscillations with nearly bi-maximal mixing
factors. The similarity and difference between lepton and quark flavor mixing
schemes are briefly discussed.

text,Neutrino decays as a natural explanation of the neutrino mass tension,17,hep-ph/0010206,0.874567449092865,Neutrino Mass: The Present and the Future,hep-ph,"  We argue that the evidence for neutrino mass is quite compelling. This mass
raises a number of questions, which we enumerate, about neutrinos. Then we
focus on one of these questions---the issue of the possible neutrino mass
spectra. In particular, we explain that one can have a four-neutrino spectrum
which does not require significant sterile-neutrino involvement in either the
atmospheric or solar neutrino oscillations.

  Rotation",hep-ph,"  It is shown that a fermion mass matrix changing in orientation (rotating)
with changing scales can give a simple yet near-quantitative explanation for
quark mixing, neutrino oscillations and the fermion mass hierarchy.

text,Neutrino decays as a natural explanation of the neutrino mass tension,19,2211.04403,0.8739094138145447,"Neutrino mass and leptogenesis in a hybrid seesaw model with a
  spontaneously broken CP",hep-ph,"  We introduce a novel hybrid framework combining type I and type II seesaw
models for neutrino mass where a complex vacuum expectation value of a singlet
scalar field breaks CP spontaneously. Using pragmatic organizing symmetries we
demonstrate that such a model can simultaneously explain the neutrino
oscillation data and generate observed baryon asymmetry through leptogenesis.
Interestingly, natural choice of parameters leads to a mixed leptogenesis
scenario driven by nearly degenerate scalar triplet and right handed singlet
neutrino fields for which we present a detailed quantitative analysis.

text,Neutrino decays as a natural explanation of the neutrino mass tension,20,2211.00070,0.8731425404548645,de Sitter symmetry and neutrino oscillations,physics.gen-ph,"  Although the phenomenon of neutrino oscillations is confirmed in many
experiments, the theoretical explanation of this phenomenon in the literature
is essentially model dependent and is not based on rigorous physical
principles. We propose an approach where the neutrino is treated as a massless
elementary particle in anti-de Sitter (AdS) invariant quantum theory. In
contrast to standard Poincare invariant quantum theory, an AdS analog of the
mass squared changes over time even for elementary particles. Our approach
naturally explains why, in contrast to the neutrino, the electron, muon and tau
lepton do not have flavors changing over time and why the number of solar
neutrinos reaching the Earth is around a third of the number predicted by the
standard solar model.
