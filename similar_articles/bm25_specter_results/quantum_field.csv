text,quantum field theory gauge symmetry,1,1110.1176,0.8293874859809875,Classical gauge gravitation theory,math-ph gr-qc math.MP,"  Classical gravitation theory is formulated as gauge theory on natural bundles
where gauge symmetries are general covariant transformations and a
gravitational field is a Higgs field responsible for their spontaneous symmetry
breaking.

text,quantum field theory gauge symmetry,2,hep-th/0602185,0.829078197479248,Twist to close,hep-th,"  It has been proposed that the Poincare and some other symmetries of
noncommutative field theories should be twisted. Here we extend this idea to
gauge transformations and find that twisted gauge symmetries close for
arbitrary gauge group. We also analyse twisted-invariant actions in
noncommutative theories.

text,quantum field theory gauge symmetry,3,1310.8164,0.8200099468231201,Gauge fields beyond perturbation theory,hep-th,"  A new formulation of nonabelian gauge theories, introducing new ghost fields
and new symmetry is proposed. This formulation does not suffer from Gribov
ambiguity and allows to quantize nonabelian gauge fields beyond perturbation
theory.

text,quantum field theory gauge symmetry,4,1302.3183,0.8184289932250977,Lattice BRST without Neuberger 0/0 problem,hep-th hep-lat,"  We illustrate in a simple toy model how the methods of SUSY quantum mechanics
and topological quantum field theory can be used for covariant gauge-fixing
with unbroken BRST symmetry on a finite lattice.

text,quantum field theory gauge symmetry,5,0711.4091,0.8154104351997375,Symmetries in noncommutative field theories: Hopf versus Lie,hep-th,"  I discuss motivations for introducing Hopf algebra symmetries in
noncommutative field theories and briefly describe twisting of main symmetry
transformations. New results include an extended list of twisted gauge
invariants (which may help to overcome the problem of inconsistency of
equations of motion) and a gauge-covariant twist operator (leading to a
gauge-covariant star product).
"
text,quantum field theory gauge symmetry,6,1611.08856,0.8126599788665771,Gauge Fixing Invariance and Anti-BRST Symmetry,hep-th,"  It is shown that anti-BRST invariance in quantum gauge theories can be
considered as the quantized version of the symmetry of classical gauge theories
with respect to different gauge fixing mechanisms.

text,quantum field theory gauge symmetry,7,1602.06776,0.8103095293045044,Lecture on Gauge Gravitation Theory. Gravity as a Higgs Field,math-ph gr-qc hep-th math.MP,"  Gravitation theory is formulated as gauge theory on natural bundles with
spontaneous symmetry breaking where gauge symmetries are general covariant
transformations, gauge fields are general linear connections, and Higgs fields
are pseudo-Riemannian metrics.
"
text,quantum field theory gauge symmetry,8,0802.2382,0.8075937032699585,Mathematical models of spontaneous symmetry breaking,math-ph math.MP,"  The Higgs mechanism of mass generation is the main ingredient in the
contemporary Standard Model and its various generalizations. However, there is
no comprehensive theory of spontaneous symmetry breaking. We summarize the
relevant mathematical results characterizing spontaneous symmetry breaking
phenomena in algebraic quantum theory, axiomatic quantum field theory, group
theory, and classical gauge theory.

text,quantum field theory gauge symmetry,9,1612.02612,0.8042072057723999,Off-Shell Covariantization of Algebroid Gauge Theories,hep-th math-ph math.MP,"  We present a generalized method to construct field strengths and gauge
symmetries, which yield a Yang-Mills type action with Lie n-algebroid gauge
symmetry. The procedure makes use of off-shell covariantization in a
supergeometric setting. We apply this method to the system of a 1-form gauge
field and scalar fields with Lie n-algebroid gauge symmetry. We work out some
characteristic examples.

text,quantum field theory gauge symmetry,10,1006.1039,0.8034327030181885,Theories on noncommutative spaces and deformed symmetries,hep-th,"  In this thesis we study different aspects of noncommutativity in quantum
mechanics, field theory and gravity. We give particular emphasis on the
underlying symmetries of these theories. Deformations of usual symmetries like
the external space time symmetries and the internal gauge symmetry in
noncommutative theories are analyzed in detail.

text,quantum field theory gauge symmetry,11,2005.04125,0.8032451868057251,A Gauge Theory that mixes Bosonic and Fermionic Gauge Fields,hep-th,"  Using a gauge symmetry derived by applying the Dirac constraint formalism to
supergravity with cosmological term in 2+1 dimensions, we construct a gauge
theory with many characteristics of Yang-Mills theory. The gauge transformation
mixes two Bosonic fields and one Fermionic field.

text,quantum field theory gauge symmetry,12,math-ph/9807029,0.801643967628479,Constrained quantization in algebraic field theory,math-ph math.MP math.OA,"  Quantization relates Poisson algebras to $C^*$-algebras. The analysis of
local gauge symmetries in algebraic quantum field theory is approached through
the quantization of classical gauge theories, regarded as constrained dynamical
systems. This approach is based on the analogy between symplectic reduction and
Rieffel induction on the classical and on the quantum side, respectively. Thus
one is led to a description of e.g. $\theta$-angles and gauge anomalies in the
algebraic setting.

text,quantum field theory gauge symmetry,13,2307.07547,0.8016241788864136,Lectures on Generalized Symmetries,hep-th,"  These are a set of lecture notes on generalized global symmetries in quantum
field theory. The focus is on invertible symmetries with a few comments
regarding non-invertible symmetries. The main topics covered are the basics of
higher-form symmetries and their properties including 't Hooft anomalies,
gauging and spontaneous symmetry breaking. We also introduce the useful notion
of symmetry topological field theories (SymTFTs). Furthermore, an introduction
to higher-group symmetries describing mixings of higher-form symmetries is
provided. Some advanced topics covered include the encoding of higher-form
symmetries in holography and geometric engineering constructions in string
theory. Throughout the text, all concepts are consistently illustrated using
gauge theories as examples.

text,quantum field theory gauge symmetry,14,0903.0478,0.8011409640312195,"Poincare' Quasi-Hopf Symmetry and Non-Associative Spacetime Algebra from
  Twisted Gauge Theories",hep-th gr-qc math-ph math.MP math.QA,"  In previous work, starting from the Moyal plane, we formulated interacting
theories of matter and gauge fields with only the former fields twisted. In
this approach, gauge theories, including the standard model, can be formulated
without new gauge degrees of freedom. We show their underlying symmetry algebra
to be Poincar\'e quasi-Hopf . The associated spacetime algebra is hence
non-associative.

text,quantum field theory gauge symmetry,15,1702.08073,0.800207257270813,Spontaneous Breaking of Gauge Groups to Discrete Symmetries,hep-ph hep-th math-ph math.MP,"  Many models of beyond Standard Model physics connect flavor symmetry with a
discrete group. Having this symmetry arise spontaneously from a gauge theory
maintains compatibility with quantum gravity and can be used to systematically
prevent anomalies. We minimize a number of Higgs potentials that break gauge
groups to discrete symmetries of interest, and examine their scalar mass
spectra.

text,quantum field theory gauge symmetry,16,1503.08397,0.7997798323631287,Exceptional Field Theory for $E_{6(6)}$ supergravity,hep-th,"  A brief description of the supersymmetric and duality covariant approach to
supergravity is presented. The formalism is based on exceptional geometric
structures and turns the hidden U-duality group into a manifest gauge symmetry.
Tensor hierarchy of gauged supergravity appears naturally here as a consequence
of covariance of the construction. Finally, the full supersymmetric Lagrangian
is explicitly constructed. This work was presented on the International
Conference ""Quantum Field Theory and Gravity (QFTG'14)"" in Tomsk.

text,quantum field theory gauge symmetry,17,1402.3373,0.798509418964386,Field-dependent quantum gauge transformation,hep-th math-ph math.MP,"  In this paper we generalize the quantum gauge transformation of Maxwell
theory obtained through gaugeon formalism. The generalization is made by making
the bosonic transformation parameter field-dependent. The Jacobian of vacuum
functional under field-dependent quantum gauge transformation is calculated
explicitly. We show that the quantum gauge transformation with a particular
choice of field-dependent parameter connects the gaugeon actions of Maxwell
theory in two different gauges. We establish the result by connecting two
well-known gauges, namely, Lorentz gauge and axial gauge.

text,quantum field theory gauge symmetry,20,2504.05960,0.7939169406890869,Generalised Symmetries in Particle Physics,hep-ph hep-th,"  In this talk I review various notions of generalised global symmetry:
higher-form, higher-group, and non-invertible symmetry. All these notions have
had profound impact on quantum field theory research in the last decade. I
highlight various applications of these new symmetries in particle physics,
focussing on theories beyond the Standard Model. Areas touched upon include
axions, gauge unification, dark matter, neutrino masses, and flavour
hierarchies.
