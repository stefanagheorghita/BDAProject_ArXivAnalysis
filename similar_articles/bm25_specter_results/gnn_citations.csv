  embeddings",cs.CL,"  Introduction: Tracing the spread of ideas and the presence of influence is a
question of special importance across a wide range of disciplines, ranging from
intellectual history to cultural analytics, computational social science, and
the science of science.
  Method: We collect a corpus of open source journal articles, generate
Knowledge Graph representations using the Gemini LLM, and attempt to predict
the existence of citations between sampled pairs of articles using previously
published methods and a novel Graph Neural Network based embedding model.
  Results: We demonstrate that our knowledge graph embedding method is superior
at distinguishing pairs of articles with and without citation. Once trained, it
runs efficiently and can be fine-tuned on specific corpora to suit individual
researcher needs.
  Conclusion(s): This experiment demonstrates that the relationships encoded in
a knowledge graph, especially the types of concepts brought together by
specific relations can encode information capable of revealing intellectual
influence. This suggests that further work in analyzing document level
knowledge graphs to understand latent structures could provide valuable
insights.

In scientometrics, they are also central to the construction of quantitative indicators. Not all citations, however, serve the same function: some provide background, others introduce methods, or compare results. Therefore, understanding citation intent allows for a more nuanced interpretation of scientific impact. In this paper, we adopted a GAN-based method to classify citation intents. Our results revealed that the proposed method achieves competitive classification performance, closely matching state-of-the-art results with substantially fewer parameters. This demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of leveraging GAN architectures combined with contextual embeddings in intent classification task. We also investigated whether filtering citation intents affects the centrality of papers in citation networks. Analyzing the network constructed from the unArXiv dataset, we found that paper rankings can be significantly influenced by citation intent. All four centrality metrics examined- degree, PageRank, closeness, and betweenness - were sensitive to the filtering of citation types. The betweenness centrality displayed the greatest sensitivity, showing substantial changes in ranking when specific citation intents were removed."
text,graph neural networks for citation analysis,5,2104.02562,0.7614059448242188,Structured Citation Trend Prediction Using Graph Neural Networks,cs.LG cs.SI,"  Academic citation graphs represent citation relationships between
publications across the full range of academic fields. Top cited papers
typically reveal future trends in their corresponding domains which is of
importance to both researchers and practitioners. Prior citation prediction
methods often require initial citation trends to be established and do not take
advantage of the recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs). We
present GNN-based architecture that predicts the top set of papers at the time
of publication. For experiments, we curate a set of academic citation graphs
for a variety of conferences and show that the proposed model outperforms other
classic machine learning models in terms of the F1-score.

text,graph neural networks for citation analysis,6,1904.09981,0.7608433961868286,GraphNAS: Graph Neural Architecture Search with Reinforcement Learning,cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML,"  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been popularly used for analyzing
non-Euclidean data such as social network data and biological data. Despite
their success, the design of graph neural networks requires a lot of manual
work and domain knowledge. In this paper, we propose a Graph Neural
Architecture Search method (GraphNAS for short) that enables automatic search
of the best graph neural architecture based on reinforcement learning.
Specifically, GraphNAS first uses a recurrent network to generate
variable-length strings that describe the architectures of graph neural
networks, and then trains the recurrent network with reinforcement learning to
maximize the expected accuracy of the generated architectures on a validation
data set. Extensive experimental results on node classification tasks in both
transductive and inductive learning settings demonstrate that GraphNAS can
achieve consistently better performance on the Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed citation
network, and protein-protein interaction network. On node classification tasks,
GraphNAS can design a novel network architecture that rivals the best
human-invented architecture in terms of test set accuracy.

assist Open scientific research in the Computational Linguistics domain.
Integrating and enhancing the previous versions of the ACL Anthology, the ACL
OCL contributes metadata, PDF files, citation graphs and additional structured
full texts with sections, figures, and links to a large knowledge resource
(Semantic Scholar). The ACL OCL spans seven decades, containing 73K papers,
alongside 210K figures.
  We spotlight how ACL OCL applies to observe trends in computational
linguistics. By detecting paper topics with a supervised neural model, we note
that interest in ""Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing"" is waning and ""Natural
Language Generation"" is resurging. Our dataset is available from HuggingFace

reflecting how authors frame their work, and influencing uptake by future
scholars. However, our understanding of citation behavior has been limited to
small-scale manual citation analysis. We perform the largest behavioral study
of citations to date, analyzing how citations are both framed and taken up by
scholars in one entire field: natural language processing. We introduce a new
dataset of nearly 2,000 citations annotated for function and centrality, and
use it to develop a state-of-the-art classifier and label the entire ACL
Reference Corpus. We then study how citations are framed by authors and use
both papers and online traces to track how citations are followed by readers.
We demonstrate that authors are sensitive to discourse structure and
publication venue when citing, that online readers follow temporal links to
previous and future work rather than methodological links, and that how a paper
cites related work is predictive of its citation count. Finally, we use changes
in citation roles to show that the field of NLP is undergoing a significant
increase in consensus.

  Evaluation of Graph and Text Embedding Methods",cs.SI physics.soc-ph,"  Recent advances in machine learning offer new ways to represent and study
scholarly works and the space of knowledge. Graph and text embeddings provide a
convenient vector representation of scholarly works based on citations and
text. Yet, it is unclear whether their representations are consistent or
provide different views of the structure of science. Here, we compare graph and
text embedding by testing their ability to capture the hierarchical structure
of the Physics and Astronomy Classification Scheme (PACS) of papers published
by the American Physical Society (APS). We also provide a qualitative
comparison of the overall structure of the graph and text embeddings for
reference. We find that neural network-based methods outperform traditional
methods and graph embedding methods such as node2vec are better than other
methods at capturing the PACS structure. Our results call for further
investigations into how different contexts of scientific papers are captured by
different methods, and how we can combine and leverage such information in an
interpretable manner.

  Learning",cs.LG cs.SI,"  There has been rapid growth in biomedical literature, yet capturing the
heterogeneity of the bibliographic information of these articles remains
relatively understudied. Although graph mining research via heterogeneous graph
neural networks has taken center stage, it remains unclear whether these
approaches capture the heterogeneity of the PubMed database, a vast digital
repository containing over 33 million articles. We introduce PubMed Graph
Benchmark (PGB), a new benchmark dataset for evaluating heterogeneous graph
embeddings for biomedical literature. The benchmark contains rich metadata
including abstract, authors, citations, MeSH terms, MeSH hierarchy, and some
other information. The benchmark contains three different evaluation tasks
encompassing systematic reviews, node classification, and node clustering. In
PGB, we aggregate the metadata associated with the biomedical articles from
PubMed into a unified source and make the benchmark publicly available for any
future works.

semi-supervised object classification, whereby we propose to train a
fully-connected network jointly with the graph neural network via parameter
sharing and interpolation-based regularization. Further, we provide a
theoretical analysis of how GraphMix improves the generalization bounds of the
underlying graph neural network, without making any assumptions about the
""aggregation"" layer or the depth of the graph neural networks. We
experimentally validate this analysis by applying GraphMix to various
architectures such as Graph Convolutional Networks, Graph Attention Networks
and Graph-U-Net. Despite its simplicity, we demonstrate that GraphMix can
consistently improve or closely match state-of-the-art performance using even
simpler architectures such as Graph Convolutional Networks, across three
established graph benchmarks: Cora, Citeseer and Pubmed citation network
datasets, as well as three newly proposed datasets: Cora-Full, Co-author-CS and
Co-author-Physics.

This study introduces CiteFusion, an ensemble framework designed to address the multi-class Citation Intent Classification task on two benchmark datasets: SciCite and ACL-ARC. The framework employs a one-vs-all decomposition of the multi-class task into class-specific binary subtasks, leveraging complementary pairs of SciBERT and XLNet models, independently tuned, for each citation intent. The outputs of these base models are aggregated through a feedforward neural network meta-classifier to reconstruct the original classification task. To enhance interpretability, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is employed to analyze token-level contributions, and interactions among base models, providing transparency into the classification dynamics of CiteFusion, and insights about the kind of misclassifications of the ensemble. In addition, this work investigates the semantic role of structural context by incorporating section titles, as framing devices, into input sentences, assessing their positive impact on classification accuracy. CiteFusion ultimately demonstrates robust performance in imbalanced and data-scarce scenarios: experimental results show that CiteFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, with Macro-F1 scores of 89.60% on SciCite, and 76.24% on ACL-ARC. Furthermore, to ensure interoperability and reusability, citation intents from both datasets schemas are mapped to Citation Typing Ontology (CiTO) object properties, highlighting some overlaps. Finally, we describe and release a web-based application that classifies citation intents leveraging the CiteFusion models developed on SciCite."

  Part I",cs.DL,"  This review summarizes papers which analyze impact of self-citation on
research evaluation. We introduce a generalized definition of self-citation and
its variants: author, institutional, country, journal, discipline, publisher
self-citation. Formulae of the basic self-citation measures are given, namely
self-citing and self-cited rates. World literature on author, institutional,
country and journal self-citation is studied in more detail. Current views on
the role and impact of self-citation are compiled and analyzed. It is found
that there is a general consensus on some points: (a) pathological is as
excessive self-citation so its total absence; (b) self-citation has low impact
on large science units but may be critical for analysis of individual
researchers; (c) share of self-citations is generally higher for units with low
bibliometric performance, while top scientists, institutions, journals receive
the majority of their citations from outside. This review also considers how
bibliometric instruments and databases respond to challenge of possible
manipulation by self-citations and how they correct bibliometric indicators
calculated by them. The first part of the review presented here deals with the
fundamental terms and definitions, and the most discussed and studied type of
the self-citation, author self-citation. The paper was funded by RFBR, project

text,graph neural networks for citation analysis,16,2203.12455,0.7464557886123657,Assessing Network Representations for Identifying Interdisciplinarity,cs.DL cs.SI,"  Many studies have sought to identify interdisciplinary research as a function
of the diversity of disciplines identified in an article's references or
citations. However, given the constant evolution of the scientific landscape,
disciplinary boundaries are shifting and blurring, making it increasingly
difficult to describe research within a strict taxonomy. In this work, we
explore the potential for graph learning methods to learn embedded
representations for research papers that encode their 'interdisciplinarity' in
a citation network. This facilitates the identification of interdisciplinary
research without the use of disciplinary categories. We evaluate these
representations and their ability to identify interdisciplinary research,
according to their utility in interdisciplinary citation prediction. We find
that those representations which preserve structural equivalence in the
citation graph are best able to predict distant, interdisciplinary interactions
in the network, according to multiple definitions of citation distance.

text,graph neural networks for citation analysis,17,2105.05527,0.746454656124115,Self-citation Analysis using Sentence Embeddings,cs.DL,"  The purpose of citation indexes and metrics is intended to be a measure for
scientific innovation and quality for researchers, journals, and institutions.
However, those metrics are often prone to abuse and manipulation by excessive
and unethical self-citations induced by authors, reviewers, editors, or
journals. Identifying whether there are or not legitimate reasons for
self-citations is normally determined during the review process, where the
participating parts may have intrinsic incentives, rendering the legitimacy of
self-citations, after publication, questionable. In this paper, we conduct a
large-scale analysis of journal self-citations while taking into consideration
the similarity between a publication and its references. Specifically, we look
into PubMed Central articles published since 1990 and compute similarities of
article-reference pairs using sentence embeddings. We examine journal
self-citations with an aim to distinguish between justifiable and unethical
self-citations.

  network and semantic analysis",cs.DL,"  Citations acknowledge the impact a scientific publication has on subsequent
work. At the same time, deciding how and when to cite a paper, is also heavily
influenced by social factors. In this work, we conduct an empirical analysis
based on a dataset of 2010-2012 global publications in chemical engineering. We
use social network analysis and text mining to measure publication attributes
and understand which variables can better help predicting their future success.
Controlling for intrinsic quality of a publication and for the number of
authors in the byline, we are able to predict scholarly impact of a paper in
terms of citations received six years after publication with almost 80 percent
accuracy. Results suggest that, all other things being equal, it is better to
co-publish with rotating co-authors and write the papers' abstract using more
positive words, and a more complex, thus more informative, language.
Publications that result from the collaboration of different social groups also
attract more citations.

  application to author citation networks",cs.DL cs.SI,"  Understanding the evolution of paper and author citations is of paramount
importance for the design of research policies and evaluation criteria that can
promote and accelerate scientific discoveries. Recently many studies on the
evolution of science have been conducted in the context of the emergent science
of science field. While many studies have probed the link problem in citation
networks, only a few works have analyzed the temporal nature of link prediction
in author citation networks. In this study we compared the performance of 10
well-known local network similarity measurements to predict future links in
author citations networks. Differently from traditional link prediction
methods, the temporal nature of the predict links is relevant for our approach.
Our analysis revealed interesting results. The Jaccard coefficient was found to
be among the most relevant measurements. The preferential attachment
measurement, conversely, displayed the worst performance. We also found that
the extension of local measurements to their weighted version do not
significantly improved the performance of predicting citations. Finally, we
also found that a neural network approach summarizing the information from all
10 considered similarity measurements was not able to provide the highest
prediction performance.

text,graph neural networks for citation analysis,20,2004.12275,0.7435628175735474,Citation Cascade and the Evolution of Topic Relevance,cs.SI cs.DL,"  Citation analysis, as a tool for quantitative studies of science, has long
emphasized direct citation relations, leaving indirect or high order citations
overlooked. However, a series of early and recent studies demonstrate the
existence of indirect and continuous citation impact across generations. Adding
to the literature on high order citations, we introduce the concept of a
citation cascade: the constitution of a series of subsequent citing events
initiated by a certain publication. We investigate this citation structure by
analyzing more than 450,000 articles and over 6 million citation relations. We
show that citation impact exists not only within the three generations
documented in prior research, but also in much further generations. Still, our
experimental results indicate that two to four generations are generally
adequate to trace a work's scientific impact. We also explore specific
structural properties such as depth, width, structural virality, and size,
which account for differences among individual citation cascades. Finally, we
find evidence that it is more important for a scientific work to inspire trans
domain (or indirectly related domain) works than to receive only intra domain
recognition in order to achieve high impact. Our methods and findings can serve
as a new tool for scientific evaluation and the modeling of scientific history.
