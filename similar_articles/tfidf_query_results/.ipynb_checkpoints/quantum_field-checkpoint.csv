quantum_field,1609.00985,0.6754522717172979,"Symmetry Enrichment in Three-Dimensional Topological Phases.   While two-dimensional symmetry-enriched topological phases ($\mathsf{SET}$s)
have been studied intensively and systematically, three-dimensional ones are
still open issues. We propose an algorithmic approach of imposing global
symmetry $G_s$ on gauge theories (denoted by $\mathsf{GT}$) with gauge group
$G_g$. The resulting symmetric gauge theories are dubbed ""symmetry-enriched
gauge theories"" ($\mathsf{SEG}$), which may be served as low-energy effective
theories of three-dimensional symmetric topological quantum spin liquids. We
focus on $\mathsf{SEG}$s with gauge group
$G_g=\mathbb{Z}_{N_1}\times\mathbb{Z}_{N_2}\times\cdots$ and on-site unitary
symmetry group $G_s=\mathbb{Z}_{K_1}\times\mathbb{Z}_{K_2}\times\cdots$ or
$G_s=\mathrm{U(1)}\times \mathbb{Z}_{K_1}\times\cdots$. Each
$\mathsf{SEG}(G_g,G_s)$ is described in the path integral formalism associated
with certain symmetry assignment. From the path-integral expression, we propose
how to physically diagnose the ground state properties (i.e., $\mathsf{SET}$
orders) of $\mathsf{SEG}$s in experiments of charge-loop braidings (patterns of
symmetry fractionalization) and the \emph{mixed} multi-loop braidings among
deconfined loop excitations and confined symmetry fluxes. From these
symmetry-enriched properties, one can obtain the map from $\mathsf{SEG}$s to
$\mathsf{SET}$s. By giving full dynamics to background gauge fields,
$\mathsf{SEG}$s may be eventually promoted to a set of new gauge theories
(denoted by $\mathsf{GT}^*$). Based on their gauge groups, $\mathsf{GT}^*$s may
be further regrouped into different classes each of which is labeled by a gauge
group ${G}^*_g$. Finally, a web of gauge theories involving $\mathsf{GT}$,
$\mathsf{SEG}$, $\mathsf{SET}$ and $\mathsf{GT}^*$ is achieved. We demonstrate
the above symmetry-enrichment physics and the web of gauge theories through
many concrete examples.

quantum_field,1904.04038,0.6861201265032633,"A note on unfree gauge symmetry.   We study the general structure of field theories with the unfree gauge
symmetry where the gauge parameters are restricted by differential equations.
The examples of unfree gauge symmetries include volume preserving
diffeomorphisms in the unimodular gravity and various higher spin field
theories with transverse gauge symmetries. All the known examples of the models
with unfree gauge symmetry share one common feature. They admit local
quantities which vanish on shell, though they are not linear combinations of
Lagrangian equations and their derivatives. We term these quantities as mass
shell completion functions.
  In the case of usual gauge symmetry with unconstrained gauge parameters, the
irreducible gauge algebra involves the two basic constituents: the action
functional and gauge symmetry generators. For the case of unfree gauge
symmetry, we identify two more basic constituents: operators of gauge parameter
constraints and completion functions. These two extra constituents are involved
in the algebra of unfree gauge symmetry on equal footing with action and gauge
symmetry generators.
  Proceeding from the algebra, we adjust the Faddeev-Popov (FP) path integral
quantization scheme to the case of unfree gauge symmetry. The modified FP
action involves the operators of the constraints imposed on the gauge
parameters, while the corresponding BRST transformation involves the completion
functions. The BRST symmetry ensures gauge independence of the path integral.
We provide two examples which admit the alternative unconstrained
parametrization of gauge symmetry and demonstrate that they lead to the
equivalent FP path integral.

demonstrate that optimizing the digitization of gauge theories to quantum
memory to account for noise channels can extend the lifetime before complete
loss of gauge symmetry by $2-10\times$ over some other digitizations. These
constructions also allow for quantum error correction to integrate the

quantum_field,1812.04716,0.6671670566717335,"Comments on One-Form Global Symmetries and Their Gauging in 3d and 4d.   We study 3d and 4d systems with a one-form global symmetry, explore their
consequences, and analyze their gauging. For simplicity, we focus on
$\mathbb{Z}_N$ one-form symmetries. A 3d topological quantum field theory
(TQFT) $\mathcal{T}$ with such a symmetry has $N$ special lines that generate
it. The braiding of these lines and their spins are characterized by a single
integer $p$ modulo $2N$. Surprisingly, if $\gcd(N,p)=1$ the TQFT factorizes
$\mathcal{T}=\mathcal{T}'\otimes \mathcal{A}^{N,p}$. Here $\mathcal{T}'$ is a
decoupled TQFT, whose lines are neutral under the global symmetry and
$\mathcal{A}^{N,p}$ is a minimal TQFT with the $\mathbb{Z}_N$ one-form symmetry
of label $p$. The parameter $p$ labels the obstruction to gauging the
$\mathbb{Z}_N$ one-form symmetry; i.e.\ it characterizes the 't Hooft anomaly
of the global symmetry. When $p=0$ mod $2N$, the symmetry can be gauged.
Otherwise, it cannot be gauged unless we couple the system to a 4d bulk with
gauge fields extended to the bulk. This understanding allows us to consider
$SU(N)$ and $PSU(N)$ 4d gauge theories. Their dynamics is gapped and it is
associated with confinement and oblique confinement -- probe quarks are
confined. In the $PSU(N)$ theory the low-energy theory can include a discrete
gauge theory. We will study the behavior of the theory with a space-dependent
$\theta$-parameter, which leads to interfaces. Typically, the theory on the
interface is not confining. Furthermore, the liberated probe quarks are anyons
on the interface. The $PSU(N)$ theory is obtained by gauging the $\mathbb{Z}_N$
one-form symmetry of the $SU(N)$ theory. Our understanding of the symmetries in
3d TQFTs allows us to describe the interface in the $PSU(N)$ theory.

quantum_field,2304.10042,0.6886930600876938,"Unfree gauge symmetry.   The gauge symmetry is said unfree if the gauge transformation leaves the
action functional unchanged provided for the gauge parameters are constrained
by the system of partial differential equations. The best known example of this
phenomenon is the volume preserving diffeomorphism being the gauge symmetry of
unimodular gravity (UG). Various extensions are known of the UG, including the
higher spin analogs - all with unfree gauge symmetry. Given the distinctions of
the unfree gauge symmetry from the symmetry with unrestricted gauge parameters,
the algebra of gauge transformations is essentially different. These
distinctions have consequences for all the key constituents of general gauge
theory, starting from the second Noether theorem, Hamiltonian constrained
formalism, BRST complex, and quantization. In this review article, we summarise
the modifications of general gauge theory worked out in recent years to cover
the case of unfree gauge symmetry.

of BRST symmetry is utilized. Under generalized BRST transformations, we show
that the gaugeon fields appear naturally in the reducible gauge theory.

  Theories.   Gauge symmetry plays a key role in our description of subatomic matter. The
vanishing photon mass, the long-ranged Coulomb law, and asymptotic freedom are
all due to gauge invariance. Recent years have seen tantalizing progress in the
microscopic reconstruction of gauge theories in engineered quantum simulators.
Yet, many of these are plagued by a fundamental question: When gauge symmetry
is only approximate in the quantum device, do we actually quantum-simulate a
gauge theory? Here, we answer this question in the affirmative for a paradigm
gauge theory akin to quantum electrodynamics. Analytically, we derive a
renormalized gauge symmetry that is at least exponentially accurate. Further,
numerically computing the phase diagram in the thermodynamic limit, we find
that the long-distance behavior of the gauge theory is only compromised upon
reaching a sharp quantum phase transition. This behavior is enabled by an
energy penalty term, which lends a mass to the Higgs boson to which the
coherent gauge breaking couples. Our results not only lend validity to ongoing
gauge-theory quantum simulations, they also probe the fundamental question of
how gauge symmetry could emerge in nature.

As a paradigmatic model, we consider the three-dimensional Abelian-Higgs (AH)
model with an N-component scalar field and a noncompact gauge field, which is
invariant under U(1) gauge and SU(N) transformations. We consider
gauge-symmetry breaking perturbations that are quadratic in the gauge field,
such as a photon mass term, and determine their effect on the critical behavior
of the gauge-invariant model, focusing mainly on the continuous transitions
associated with the charged fixed point of the AH field theory. We discuss
their relevance and compute the (gauge-dependent) exponents that parametrize
the departure from the critical behavior (continuum limit) of the
gauge-invariant model. We also address the critical behavior of lattice AH
models with broken gauge symmetry, showing an effective enlargement of the
global symmetry, from U(N) to O(2N), which reflects a peculiar cyclic
renormalization-group flow in the space of the lattice AH parameters and of the
photon mass.

quantum_field,1107.4664,0.7196639642008076,"Gauge symmetry breaking in gauge theories---In search of clarification.   The paper investigates the spontaneous breaking of gauge symmetries in gauge
theories from a philosophical angle, taking into account the fact that the
notion of a spontaneously broken local gauge symmetry, though widely employed
in textbook expositions of the Higgs mechanism, is not supported by our leading
theoretical frameworks of gauge quantum theories. In the context of lattice
gauge theory, the statement that local gauge symmetry cannot be spontaneously
broken can even be made rigorous in the form of Elitzur's theorem.
Nevertheless, gauge symmetry breaking does occur in gauge quantum field
theories in the form of the breaking of remnant subgroups of the original local
gauge group under which the theories typically remain invariant after gauge
fixing. The paper discusses the relation between these instances of symmetry
breaking and phase transitions and draws some more general conclusions for the
philosophical interpretation of gauge symmetries and their breaking.

quantum_field,2304.00756,0.7069121543750079,"Gauge fixing and physical symmetries.   We analyze how gauge fixing, which is required by any practical continuum
approach to gauge systems, can interfere with the physical symmetries of such
systems. In principle, the gauge fixing procedure, which deals with the
(unphysical) gauge symmetry, should not interfere with the other (physical)
symmetries. In practice, however, there can be an interference which takes two
different forms. First, depending on the considered gauge, it might not always
be simple or possible to devise approximation schemes that preserve the
physical symmetry constraints on (gauge-independent) observables. Second, even
at an exact level of discussion, the (gauge-dependent) effective action for the
gauge field, and thus the related vertex functions, may not reflect the
physical symmetries of the problem. We illustrate these difficulties using a
very general class of gauge fixings that contains the usual gauge fixings as
particular cases. Using background field techniques, we then propose specific
gauge choices that allow one to keep the physical symmetries explicit, both at
the level of the observables and at the level of the effective action for the
gauge field. Our analysis is based on the notion of invariance modulo gauge
transformations. This is not only a convenient framework to discuss symmetries
in the presence of unphysical degrees of freedom, but it also allows one to
reinterpret certain well known phenomena in gauge theories without the need to
invoke the conceptually annoying ``breaking of a gauge symmetry''.

consider scalar electrodynamics in which $N_f$ complex scalar fields interact
with a U(1) gauge field. We discuss under which conditions a gauge-symmetry
breaking term destabilizes the critical behavior (continuum limit) of the
gauge-invariant theory. We find that the gauge symmetry is robust at
transitions at which gauge fields are not critical. At charged transitions,
where gauge fields are critical, gauge symmetry is lost as soon as the
perturbation is added.

Zwanziger, Parrinello and Jona-Lasinio, which is related to the non-linear
gauge $A_{\mu}^{2}=\lambda$ of Dirac and Nambu in the large mass limit. We have
recently shown that this modified quantization scheme is in fact identical to
the conventional {\em local} Faddeev-Popov formula {\em without} taking the
large mass limit, if one takes into account the variation of the gauge field
along the entire gauge orbit and if the Gribov complications can be ignored.
This suggests that the classical massive vector theory, for example, is
interpreted in a more flexible manner either as a gauge invariant theory with a
gauge fixing term added, or as a conventional massive non-gauge theory. As for
massive gauge particles, the Higgs mechanics, where the mass term is gauge
invariant, has a more intrinsic meaning.
  It is suggested to extend the notion of quantum gauge symmetry (BRST
symmetry) not only to classical gauge theory but also to a wider class of
theories whose gauge symmetry is broken by some extra terms in the classical
action. We comment on the implications of this extended notion of quantum gauge
