geographical extensions of social influence modelling. Improved understanding
of innovation diffusion across locations and through social connections can
provide us with new insights into the spread of information, technological
progress and economic development. In this work, we analyze the spatial
adoption dynamics of iWiW, an Online Social Network (OSN) in Hungary and
uncover empirical features about the spatial adoption in social networks.
During its entire life cycle from 2002 to 2012, iWiW reached up to 300 million
friendship ties of 3 million users. We find that the number of adopters as a
function of town population follows a scaling law that reveals a strongly
concentrated early adoption in large towns and a less concentrated late
adoption. We also discover a strengthening distance decay of spread over the
life-cycle indicating high fraction of distant diffusion in early stages but
the dominance of local diffusion in late stages. The spreading process is
modelled within the Bass diffusion framework that enables us to compare the
differential equation version with an agent-based version of the model run on
the empirical network. Although both models can capture the macro trend of
adoption, they have limited capacity to describe the observed trends of urban
scaling and distance decay. We find, however that incorporating adoption
thresholds, defined by the fraction of social connections that adopt a
technology before the individual adopts, improves the network model fit to the
urban scaling of early adopters. Controlling for the threshold distribution
enables us to eliminate the bias induced by local network structure on
predicting local adoption peaks. Finally, we show that geographical features
such as distance from the innovation origin and town size influence prediction
of adoption peak at local scales.

  Security Innovations","  Information System (IS) Security threats is still a major concern for many
organisations. However, most organisations fall short in achieving a successful
adoption and implementation of IS security measures. In this paper, we
developed a theoretical model for the adoption process of IS Security
innovations in organisations. The model was derived by combining four
theoretical models of innovation adoption, namely: Diffusion of Innovation
theory (DOI), the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the Theory of Planned
Behaviour (TPB) and the Technology-Organisation-Environment (TOE) framework.
The model depicts IS security innovation adoption in organisations, as two
decision proceedings. The adoption process from the initiation stage until the
acquisition of innovation is considered as a decision made by organisation
while the process of innovation assimilation is assumed as a result of the user
acceptance of innovation within the organisation. In addition, the model
describes the IS Security adoption process progressing in three sequential
stages, i.e. pre-adoption, adoption- decision and post-adoption phases. The
model also introduces several factors that influence the different stages of IS
Security innovation adoption process. This study contributes to IS security
literature by proposing an overall model of IS security adoption that includes
organisational adoption and user acceptance of innovation in a single
illustration. Also, IS security adoption model proposed in this study provides
important practical implications for research and practice.

service is commonly interpreted as a spreading phenomenon throughout the fabric
of society. This process is arguably driven by social influence, social
learning and by external effects like media. Observations of such processes
date back to the seminal studies by Rogers and Bass, and their mathematical
modelling has taken two directions: One paradigm, called simple contagion,
identifies adoption spreading with an epidemic process. The other one, named
complex contagion, is concerned with behavioural thresholds and successfully
explains the emergence of large cascades of adoption resulting in a rapid
spreading often seen in empirical data. The observation of real world adoption
processes has become easier lately due to the availability of large digital
social network and behavioural datasets. This has allowed simultaneous study of
network structures and dynamics of online service adoption, shedding light on
the mechanisms and external effects that influence the temporal evolution of
behavioural or innovation adoption. These advancements have induced the
development of more realistic models of social spreading phenomena, which in
turn have provided remarkably good predictions of various empirical adoption
processes. In this chapter we review recent data-driven studies addressing
real-world service adoption processes. Our studies provide the first detailed
empirical evidence of a heterogeneous threshold distribution in adoption. We
also describe the modelling of such phenomena with formal methods and
data-driven simulations. Our objective is to understand the effects of
identified social mechanisms on service adoption spreading, and to provide
potential new directions and open questions for future research.

  Education","  Contributions: An adoption framework to include GenAI in the university
curriculum. It identifies and highlights the role of different stakeholders
(university management, students, staff, etc.) during the adoption process. It
also proposes an objective approach based upon an evaluation matrix to assess
the success and outcome of the GenAI adoption.
  Background: Universities worldwide are debating and struggling with the
adoption of GenAI in their curriculum. Both the faculty and students are unsure
about the approach in the absence of clear guidelines through the
administration and regulators. This requires an established framework to define
a process and articulate the roles and responsibilities of each stakeholder
involved.
  Research Questions: Whether the academic ecosystem requires a methodology to
adopt GenAI into its curriculum? A systematic approach for the academic staff
to ensure the students' learning outcomes are met with the adoption of GenAI.
How to measure and communicate the adoption of GenAI in the university setup?
  Methodology: The methodology employed in this study focuses on examining the
university education system and assessing the opportunities and challenges
related to incorporating GenAI in teaching and learning. Additionally, it
identifies a gap and the absence of a comprehensive framework that obstructs
the effective integration of GenAI within the academic environment.
  Findings: The literature survey results indicate the limited or no adoption
of GenAI by the university, which further reflects the dilemma in the minds of
different stakeholders. For the successful adoption of GenAI, a standard
framework is proposed i) for effective redesign of the course curriculum, ii)
for enabling staff and students, iii) to define an evaluation matrix to measure
the effectiveness and success of the adoption process.

Yet regional EV adoption varies widely, and prior studies often overlook county-level heterogeneity by relying on broad state-level analyses or limited city samples. Such approaches risk masking local patterns and may lead to inaccurate or non-transferable policy recommendations. This study introduces a graph-theoretic framework that complements predictive modeling to better capture how county-level characteristics relate to EV adoption. Feature importances from multiple predictive models are averaged and used as weights within a weighted Gower similarity metric to construct a county similarity network. A mutual k-nearest-neighbors procedure and modularity-based community detection identify 27 clusters of counties with similar weighted feature profiles. EV adoption rates are then analyzed across clusters, and standardized effect sizes (Cohens d) highlight the most distinguishing features for each cluster. Findings reveal consistent global trends, such as declining median income, educational attainment, and charging-station availability across lower adoption tiers; while also uncovering important local variations that general trend or prediction analyses fail to capture. In particular, some low-adoption groups are rural but not economically disadvantaged, whereas others are urbanized yet experience high poverty rates, demonstrating that different mechanisms can lead to the same adoption outcome. By exposing both global structural patterns and localized deviations, this framework provides policymakers with actionable, cluster-specific insights for designing more effective and context-sensitive EV adoption strategies."

societies. Signals of social identity are known to influence individual
behaviors in the adoption of innovations. Yet the population-level consequences
of identity signaling on the diffusion of innovations are largely unknown. Here
we use both analytical and agent-based modeling to consider the spread of a
beneficial innovation in a structured population in which there exist two
groups who are averse to being mistaken for each other. We investigate the
dynamics of adoption and consider the role of structural factors such as
demographic skew and communication scale on population-level outcomes. We find
that outgroup aversion can lead to adoption being delayed or suppressed in one
group, and that population-wide underadoption is common. Comparing the two
models, we find that differential adoption can arise due to structural
constraints on information flow even in the absence of intrinsic between-group
differences in adoption rates. Further, we find that patterns of polarization
in adoption at both local and global scales depend on the details of
demographic organization and the scale of communication. This research has
particular relevance to widely beneficial but identity-relevant products and
behaviors, such as green technologies, where overall levels of adoption
determine the positive benefits that accrue to society at large.

  Crossover phenomena in phase transition","  Heterogeneous adoption thresholds exist widely in social contagions, but were
always neglected in previous studies. We first propose a non-Markovian
spreading threshold model with general adoption threshold distribution. In
order to understand the effects of heterogeneous adoption thresholds
quantitatively, an edge-based compartmental theory is developed for the
proposed model. We use a binary spreading threshold model as a specific
example, in which some individuals have a low adoption threshold (i.e.,
activists) while the remaining ones hold a relatively high adoption threshold
(i.e., bigots), to demonstrate that heterogeneous adoption thresholds markedly
affect the final adoption size and phase transition. Interestingly, the
first-order, second-order and hybrid phase transitions can be found in the
system. More importantly, there are two different kinds of crossover phenomena
in phase transition for distinct values of bigots' adoption threshold: a change
from first-order or hybrid phase transition to the second-order phase
transition. The theoretical predictions based on the suggested theory agree
very well with the results of numerical simulations.

  Adoption and Charging Infrastructure Growth","  The increasing global demand for conventional energy has led to significant
challenges, particularly due to rising CO2 emissions and the depletion of
natural resources. In the U.S., light-duty vehicles contribute significantly to
transportation sector emissions, prompting a global shift toward electrified
vehicles (EVs). Among the challenges that thwart the widespread adoption of EVs
is the insufficient charging infrastructure (CI). This study focuses on
exploring the complex relationship between EV adoption and CI growth. Employing
a graph theoretic approach, we propose a graph model to analyze correlations
between EV adoption and CI growth across 137 counties in six states. We examine
how different time granularities impact these correlations in two distinct
scenarios: Early Adoption and Late Adoption. Further, we conduct causality
tests to assess the directional relationship between EV adoption and CI growth
in both scenarios. Our main findings reveal that analysis using lower levels of
time granularity result in more homogeneous clusters, with notable differences
between clusters in EV adoption and those in CI growth. Additionally, we
identify causal relationships between EV adoption and CI growth in 137
counties, and show that causality is observed more frequently in Early Adoption
scenarios than in Late Adoption ones. However, the causal effects in Early
Adoption are slower than those in Late Adoption.

This study introduces a time-series-based analytical framework that quantifies and classifies adoption behaviors of geographic entities within a region. A novel metric, the Adoption over Time Index (ATI), captures cumulative adoption intensity and identifies shifts in adoption trends, improving the ability to distinguish between fundamental adoption paths. By combining ATI with three key features found to be indicative of adoption dynamics, we define a typology of eight distinct paths, including two newly identified trajectories - the decelerating path and the declining moderate path. Applying this framework to a case study of an off-grid Bedouin population in southern Israel reveals that these retreating paths exist in substantial proportions. Identifying such trends is critical for addressing stagnation and preventing backsliding in the diffusion process. The leaping path, by contrast, was nearly absent. We also identify behavioral diversity within both front-runner and trailing groups. Differentiating among these groups can help tailor acceleration strategies. The analysis further reveals significant disparities in adoption levels across the region, with lagging clusters being widespread and overall adoption falling short of the region's potential."

the social interactions of individuals in a population. The Bass diffusion
model has been widely used to model the temporal evolution of adoption in such
social systems. In the model, the likelihood of a new adoption is proportional
to the number of previous adopters, implicitly assuming a global (or
homogeneous) interaction among all individuals in the network. Such global
interactions do not exist in many large social networks, however. Instead,
individuals typically interact with a small part of the larger population. To
quantify the growth rate (or equivalently the adoption timing) in networks with
limited interactions, we study a stochastic adoption process where the
likelihood that each individual adopts is proportional to the number of
adopters among the small group of persons he/she interacts with (and not the
entire population of adopters). When the underlying network of interactions is
a random $k$-regular graph, we compute the sample path limit of the fraction of
adopters. We show the limit coincides with the solution of a differential
equation which can viewed as a generalization of the Bass diffusion model. When
the degree $k$ is bounded, we show the adoption curve differs significantly
from the one corresponds to the Bass diffusion model. In particular, the
adoption grows more slowly than what the Bass model projects. In addition, the
adoption curve is asymmetric, unlike that of the Bass diffusion model. Such
asymmetry has important consequences for the estimation of market potential.
Finally, we calculate the timing of early adoptions at finer scales, e.g.,
logarithmic in the population size.

Before players bargain, the seller decides whether to adopt a new technology

observe the seller's adoption decision, players' reputational incentives can
lead to inefficient under-adoption and significant delays in reaching
agreement, and that these inefficiencies arise in equilibrium if and only if
the social benefit from adoption is large enough. Our result implies that an
increase in the benefit from adoption may lower the probability of adoption and
that the seller's opportunity to adopt a cost-saving technology may lower
social welfare.

adoption decisions based on several factors, including the technologies'
intrinsic qualities, negative congestion externalities from other subscribers,
and the flat access rates that a WSP charges. We then show how these user-level
decisions translate into aggregate adoption dynamics and prove that these
converge to a unique equilibrium for a given set of exogenously determined
system parameters. We fully characterize these equilibria and study adoption
behaviors of interest to a WSP. We then derive analytical expressions for the
revenue-maximizing prices and optimal coverage factor for the supplementary
technology and examine some resulting non-intuitive user adoption behaviors.
Finally, we develop a mobile app to collect empirical 3G/WiFi usage data and
numerically investigate the profit-maximizing adoption levels when a WSP
accounts for its cost of deploying the supplemental technology and savings from
offloading traffic onto this technology.

so-called complex threshold dynamics and a simple
Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model. Separately, these mechanisms
lead, respectively, to first order and continuous transitions between
non-adoption and adoption phases. We consider two interconnected layers. While
all nodes on the first layer follow the complex adoption process, all nodes on
the second layer follow the simple adoption process. Coupling between the two
adoption processes occurs as a result of the inclusion of some additional
interconnections between layers. We find that the transition points and also
the nature of the transitions are modified in the coupled dynamics. In the
complex adoption layer, the critical threshold required for extension of
adoption increases with interlayer connectivity whereas in the case of an
isolated single network it would decrease with average connectivity. In
addition, the transition can become continuous depending on the detailed inter
and intralayer connectivities. In the SIS layer, any interlayer connectivity
leads to the extension of the adopter phase. Besides, a new transition appears
as as sudden drop of the fraction of adopters in the SIS layer. The main
numerical findings are described by a mean-field type analytical approach
appropriately developed for the threshold-SIS coupled system.

  DevOps Adoption in Practice","  Background. DevOps is a set of practices and cultural values that aims to
reduce the barriers between development and operations teams. Due to its
increasing interest and imprecise definitions, existing research works have
tried to characterize DevOps---mainly using a set of concepts and related
practices. Aims. Nevertheless, little is known about thepractitioners
practitioners' understanding about successful paths for DevOps adoption. The
lack of such understanding might hinder institutions to adopt DevOps practices.
Therefore, our goal here is to present a theory about DevOps adoption,
highlighting the main related concepts that contribute to its adoption in
industry. Method. Our work builds upon Classic Grounded Theory. We interviewed
practitioners that contributed to DevOps adoption in 15 companies from
different domains and across 5 countries. We empirically evaluate our model
through a case study, whose goal is to increase the maturity level of DevOps
adoption at the Brazilian Federal Court of Accounts, a Brazilian Government
institution.Results. This paper presents a model to improve both the
understanding and guidance of DevOps adoption. The model increments the
existing view of DevOps by explaining the role and motivation of each category
(and their relationships) in the DevOps adoption process. We organize this
model in terms of DevOps enabler categories and DevOps outcome categories. We
provide evidence that collaboration is the core DevOps concern, contrasting
with an existing wisdom that implanting specific tools to automate building,
deployment, and infrastructure provisioning and management is enough to achieve
DevOps. Conclusions. Altogether, our results contribute to (a) generating an
adequate understanding of DevOps, from the perspective of practitioners; and
(b) assisting other institutions in the migration path towards DevOps adoption.

  Modelling","  The agricultural sector is facing mounting demands to enhance energy
efficiency within farm enterprises, concurrent with a steady escalation in
electricity costs. This paper focuses on modelling the adoption rate of
photovoltaic (PV) energy within the dairy sector in Ireland. An agent-based
modelling approach is introduced to estimate the adoption rate. The model
considers grid energy prices, revenue, costs, and maintenance expenses to
calculate the probability of PV adoption. The ABM outputs estimate that by year
2022, 2.45% of dairy farmers have installed PV. This is a 0.45% difference to
the actual PV adoption rate in year 2022. This validates the proposed ABM. The
paper demonstrates the increasing interest in PV systems as evidenced by the
rate of adoption, shedding light on the potential advantages of PV energy
adoption in agriculture. This study possesses the potential to forecast future
rates of PV energy adoption among dairy farmers. It establishes a groundwork
for further research on predicting and understanding the factors influencing
the adoption of renewable energy.

  Difference-in-Differences: The Effects of Adoption of an Online Consultation
  System on Prescribing Patterns of Antibiotics","  We use a recently proposed staggered difference-in-differences approach to
investigate effects of adoption of an online consultation system in English
general practice on antibiotic prescribing patterns. The target estimand is the
average effect for each group of practices (defined by year of adoption) in
each year, which we aggregate across all adopting practices, by group, and by
time since adoption. We find strong evidence of a positive effect of adoption
on antibiotic prescribing rates, though the magnitude of effect is relatively
small. As time since adoption increases, the effect size increases, while
effects vary across groups.

  factors associated with the adoption of photovoltaic systems by municipal
  authorities in Germany","  This research article explores potential influencing factors of solar
photovoltaic (PV) system adoption by municipal authorities in Germany in the
year 2019. We derive seven hypothesized relationships from the empirical
literature on residential PV adoption, organizational technology adoption, and
sustainability policy adoption by local governments, and apply a twofold
empirical approach to examine them. First, we explore the associations of a set
of explanatory variables on the installed capacity of adopter municipalities
(N=223) in an OLS model. Second, we use a logit model to analyze whether the
identified relationships are also apparent between adopter and non-adopter
municipalities (N=423). Our findings suggest that fiscal capacity (measured by
per capita debt and per capita tax revenue) and peer effects (measured by the
pre-existing installed capacity) are positively associated with both the
installed capacity and adoption. Furthermore, we find that institutional
capacity (measured by the presence of a municipal utility) and environmental
concern (measured by the share of green party votes) are positively associated
with municipal PV adoption. Economic factors (measured by solar irradiation)
show a significant positive but small effect in both regression models. No
evidence was found to support the influence of political will. Results for the
role of municipal characteristics are mixed, although the population size was
consistently positively associated with municipal PV adoption and installed
capacity. Our results support previous studies on PV system adoption
determinants and offer a starting point for additional research on
non-residential decision-making and PV adoption.

Adoption spreads through social contagion and perceived benefits, while opinions evolve via social interactions and feedback from adoption levels. Individuals may abandon adoption due to dissatisfaction or external constraints, potentially hindering diffusion. We analyze system equilibria and their stability, identifying conditions under which adoption persists. We introduce a Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy that dynamically adapts interventions to the predicted system evolution. Three types of control are compared: shaping opinions, acting on the adoption rate, and reducing dissatisfaction. Overall, MPC interventions outperform static constant control, achieving higher adoption at comparable or lower cost. These results highlight the potential of predictive, adaptive strategies to support sustainable behavior diffusion, offering policymakers scalable tools for effective interventions."

  In Somalia","  The use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) can advance the
Agricultural Business sector, particularly in a country seeking opportunities
to explore the sector. There is evidence that ICT has made significant
contributions to agribusiness because it allows enterprises to manage their
operations, and it has major impacts on the business. However, the critical
factors that motivate the adoption of new innovative technology by agribusiness
enterprises are underexplored. The literature has indicated ICT adoption among
small-scale agribusiness enterprises in Somalia is not fully understood.
Nevertheless, this study addresses this gap by investigating the adoption of
ICT among small-scale agribusiness enterprises in Somalia. The paper reports
the use of the Technology, Organization, Environment (TOE) framework. An online
survey has been conducted with random sampling for data collection, with 107
respondents. The respondents are from agribusiness staff and farmers from
various agricultural companies in Somalia. After quantitative data analysis,
the results indicated that relative advantage, complexity, top management
support, and competitive pressure factors are significant contributors to ICT
adoption in Somalian agribusiness enterprises, while ICT costs and vendor
support are not significantly related to the adoption of ICT in agricultural
business. This study concludes that ICT adoption in Somalia is inspired by
insight and motivation rather than financial and external support.
Understanding these factors leads to a better understanding of ICT adoption in
Somalia. Additionally, it enriches the literature about the agriculture
business on the African continent
