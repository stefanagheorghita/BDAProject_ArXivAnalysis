neutrinos and the details of the potentially new physics responsible for
neutrino decay. In the case where the decays involve active neutrinos in the
final state, the neutrino masses also qualitatively impact how these manifest
themselves experimentally. In order to further understand the impact of nonzero
neutrino masses, we explore how observations of solar neutrinos constrain a
very simple toy model. We assume that neutrinos are Dirac fermions and there is
a new massless scalar that couples to neutrinos such that a heavy neutrino -
$\nu_2$ with mass $m_2$ - can decay into a lighter neutrino - $\nu_1$ with mass
$m_1$ - and a massless scalar. We find that the constraints on the new physics
coupling depend, sometimes significantly, on the ratio of the
daughter-to-parent neutrino masses, and that, for large enough values of the
new physics coupling, the ""dark side"" of the solar neutrino parameter space -
$\sin^2\theta_{12}\sim 0.7$ - provides a reasonable fit to solar neutrino data.
Our results generalize to other neutrino-decay scenarios, including those that
mediate $\nu_2\to\nu_1\bar{\nu}_3\nu_3$ when the neutrino mass ordering is
inverted mass and $m_2>m_1\gg m_3$, the mass of $\nu_3$.

raises a number of questions, which we enumerate, about neutrinos. Then we
focus on one of these questions---the issue of the possible neutrino mass
spectra. In particular, we explain that one can have a four-neutrino spectrum
which does not require significant sterile-neutrino involvement in either the
atmospheric or solar neutrino oscillations.

probe of neutrino masses, it is in trouble with local direct measurements of
$H_0$, which is called the $H_0$ tension. Since neutrino masses are correlated
with $H_0$ in CMB, one can expect the cosmological bound on neutrino masses
would be much affected by the $H_0$ tension. We investigate what impact this
tension brings to cosmological bound on neutrino masses by assuming a model
with modified recombination which has been shown to resolve the tension. We
argue that constraints on neutrino masses become significantly weaker in models
where the $H_0$ tension can be resolved.

1705.03599,hep-ph hep-ex,0.6608510667365645,Neutrino decays as a natural explanation of the neutrino mass tension,Visible neutrino decay at DUNE,"  If the heaviest neutrino mass eigenstate is unstable, its decay modes could
include lighter neutrino eigenstates. In this case part of the decay products
could be visible, as they would interact at neutrino detectors via mixing. At
neutrino oscillation experiments, a characteristic signature of such
\emph{visible neutrino decay} would be an apparent excess of events at low
energies. We focus on a simple phenomenological model in which the heaviest
neutrino decays as $\nu_3 \rightarrow \nu_{1,2} + \phi$, where $\phi$ is a new
light scalar. If neutrinos are Majorana particles the helicity-flipping decays
would be observable (i.e., $\nu \to \bar\nu + \phi$), leading to interesting
observable consequences on the event rates. We compute the sensitivities of the
Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) to the couplings of the new scalar
as a function of the lightest neutrino mass. Under the assumption that only the
heaviest neutrino is unstable, and for a normal mass ordering, we find that
DUNE will be sensitive to values of $\tau_3/m_3 > 1.95 - 2.6\times
10^{-10}$~s/eV (90\% C.L.) (depending on the lightest neutrino mass), where
$\tau_3$ and $m_3$ are the lifetime and mass of $\nu_3$, respectively.

developed significantly due to the long-baseline measurements of muon-neutrino
disappearance and muon-to-electron-neutrino appearance at the T2K and NOvA
experiments. However, when interpreted under the
standard-three-massive-neutrinos paradigm, a tension has emerged between the
two experiments' data. Here, we examine whether this tension can be alleviated
when a fourth, very light neutrino is added to the picture. Specifically, we
focus on the scenario in which this new neutrino has a mass similar to, or even
lighter than, the three mostly-active neutrinos that have been identified to
date. We find that, for some regions of parameter space, the four-neutrino
framework is favored over the three-neutrino one with moderate (a little under
two sigma) significance. Interpreting these results, we provide future outlook
for near-term and long-term experiments if this four-neutrino framework is
indeed true.

topological formulation of gravitational anomaly. We first recapitulate how a
gravitational $\theta$-term leads to the emergence of a new bound neutrino
state analogous to the $\eta'$ meson of QCD. Then we show the consequent
formation of a neutrino vacuum condensate, which effectively generates small
neutrino masses. Afterwards we outline several phenomenological consequences of
our neutrino mass generation model. The cosmological neutrino mass bound
vanishes since we predict the neutrinos to be massless until the phase
transition in the late Universe, $T\sim {\rm meV}$. Deviations from an equal
flavor rate due to enhanced neutrino decays in extraterrestrial neutrino fluxes
can be observed in future IceCube data. The current cosmological neutrino
background only consists of the lightest neutrinos, which, due to enhanced
neutrino-neutrino interactions, either bind up, form a superfluid, or
completely annihilate into massless bosons. Strongly coupled relic neutrinos
could provide a contribution to cold dark matter in the late Universe, together
with the new proposed particles and topological defects, which may have formed
during neutrino condensation. These enhanced interactions could also be a
source of relic neutrino clustering in our Galaxy, which possibly makes the
overdense cosmic neutrino background detectable in the KATRIN experiment. The
neutrino condensate provides a mass for the hypothetical $B-L$ gauge boson,
leading to a gravity-competing force detectable in short-distance measurements.
Gravitational waves detections have the potential to probe our neutrino mass
generation mechanism.

0810.2297,hep-ph astro-ph,0.6432630633593006,Neutrino decays as a natural explanation of the neutrino mass tension,Nonstandard neutrino-neutrino refractive effects in dense neutrino gases,"  We investigate the effects of nonstandard four-fermion neutrino-neutrino
interactions on the flavor evolution of dense neutrino gases. We find that in
the regions where the neutrino-neutrino refractive index leads to collective
flavor oscillations, the presence of new neutrino interactions can produce
flavor equilibration in both normal and inverted neutrino mass hierarchy. In
realistic supernova environments, these effects are significant if the
nonstandard neutrino-neutrino interaction strength is comparable to the one
expected in the standard case, dominating the ordinary matter potential.
However, very small nonstandard neutrino-neutrino couplings are enough to
trigger the usual collective neutrino flavor transformations in the inverted
neutrino mass hierarchy, even if the mixing angle vanishes exactly.

into account are able to access the so far imperceptible absolute neutrino
masses at the electronvolt level. The neutrino mass spectrum derived in this
way is independent of the nature of neutrinos (Dirac or Majorana). Furthermore,
the lack of neutrinoless double beta decay gives additional constraints on the
Majorana neutrino mass spectrum. A case of three neutrinos is examined.
Influence of different solutions to the solar neutrino deficit problem on the
results is discussed. Apart from the present situation, four qualitatively
distinct experimental situations which are possible in the future are
investigated: when the two decay experiments give only upper bounds on
effective neutrino masses, when either one of them gives a positive result, and
when both give positive results. The discussion is carried out by taking into
account the present experimental errors of relevant neutrino parameters as well
as their much more precise expected estimations (e.g. by $\nu$ factories). It
is shown in which cases the upgraded decay experiments simultaneously with
neutrino oscillation data may be able to fix the absolute scale of the neutrino
mass spectrum, answer the question of the neutrino nature and put some light on
CP phases in the lepton sector.

2501.11336,hep-ex,0.6557627150263547,Neutrino decays as a natural explanation of the neutrino mass tension,"Probing invisible neutrino decay with the first six detection units of
  KM3NeT/ORCA","  In the era of precision measurements of neutrino oscillation parameters, it
is necessary for experiments to disentangle discrepancies that may indicate
physics beyond the Standard Model in the neutrino sector. KM3NeT/ORCA is a
water Cherenkov neutrino detector under construction and anchored at the bottom
of the Mediterranean Sea. The detector is designed to study the oscillations of
atmospheric neutrinos and determine the neutrino mass ordering. This paper
focuses on the initial configuration of ORCA, referred to as ORCA6, which
comprises six out of the foreseen 115 detection units of photosensors. A
high-purity neutrino sample was extracted during 2020 and 2021, corresponding
to an exposure of 433 kton-years. This sample is analysed following a binned
log-likelihood approach to search for invisible neutrino decay, in a
three-flavour neutrino oscillation scenario, where the third neutrino mass
state $\nu_3$ decays into an invisible state, e.g. a sterile neutrino. The
resulting best fit of the invisible neutrino decay parameter is $\alpha_3 =
0.92^{+1.08}_{-0.57}\times 10^{-4}~\mathrm{eV^2}$, corresponding to a scenario
with $\theta_{23}$ in the second octant and normal neutrino mass ordering. The
results are consistent with the Standard Model, within a $2.1\,\sigma$
interval.

1106.4479,hep-ph astro-ph.CO hep-ex,0.6468408626425911,Neutrino decays as a natural explanation of the neutrino mass tension,Sterile Neutrino Fits,"  After a brief review of the results of solar, atmospheric and long-baseline
neutrino oscillation experiments which led to the current three-neutrino mixing
paradigm, we discuss indications of neutrino oscillation experiments in favor
of short-baseline oscillations which require the existence of one or more
sterile neutrinos. We show that the simplest possibility of existence of one
sterile neutrino is not enough to fit all data of short-baseline neutrino
oscillation experiments because of two tensions: a tension between neutrino and
antineutrino data and a tension between appearance and disappearance data. The
tension between neutrino and antineutrino data is eliminated with the addition
of a second sterile neutrino which allows CP-violating effects in
short-baseline experiments. In this case the tension between appearance and
disappearance data is reduced, but cannot be eliminated.

2007.04994,hep-ph astro-ph.CO hep-ex,0.6449303261470383,Neutrino decays as a natural explanation of the neutrino mass tension,Relaxing Cosmological Neutrino Mass Bounds with Unstable Neutrinos,"  At present, cosmological observations set the most stringent bound on the
neutrino mass scale. Within the standard cosmological model ($\Lambda$CDM), the
Planck collaboration reports $\sum m_\nu < 0.12\,\text{eV}$ at 95% CL. This
bound, taken at face value, excludes many neutrino mass models. However,
unstable neutrinos, with lifetimes shorter than the age of the universe
$\tau_\nu \lesssim t_U$, represent a particle physics avenue to relax this
constraint. Motivated by this fact, we present a taxonomy of neutrino decay
modes, categorizing them in terms of particle content and final decay products.
Taking into account the relevant phenomenological bounds, our analysis shows
that 2-body decaying neutrinos into BSM particles are a promising option to
relax cosmological neutrino mass bounds. We then build a simple extension of
the type I seesaw scenario by adding one sterile state $\nu_4$ and a Goldstone
boson $\phi$, in which $\nu_i \to \nu_4 \, \phi$ decays can loosen the neutrino
mass bounds up to $\sum m_\nu \sim 1\,\text{eV}$, without spoiling the light
neutrino mass generation mechanism. Remarkably, this is possible for a large
range of the right-handed neutrino masses, from the electroweak up to the GUT
scale. We successfully implement this idea in the context of minimal neutrino
mass models based on a $U(1)_{\mu-\tau}$ flavor symmetry, which are otherwise
in tension with the current bound on $\sum m_\nu$.

hep-ph/9611465,hep-ph,0.6666738679302792,Neutrino decays as a natural explanation of the neutrino mass tension,Neutrino Masses and Oscillations,"  New effects related to refraction of neutrinos in different media are
reviewed and implication of the effects to neutrino mass and mixing are
discussed. Patterns of neutrino masses and mixing implied by existing
hints/bounds are described. Recent results on neutrino mass generation are
presented. They include neutrino masses in SO(10) GUT's and models with
anomalous $U(1)$, generation of neutrino mass via neutrino-neutralino mixing,
models of sterile neutrino.

1608.02358,astro-ph.CO gr-qc hep-ph,0.6646023894790838,Neutrino decays as a natural explanation of the neutrino mass tension,Dynamics of neutrino lumps in growing neutrino quintessence,"  We investigate the formation and dissipation of large scale neutrino
structures in cosmologies where the time evolution of dynamical dark energy is
stopped by a growing neutrino mass. In models where the coupling between
neutrinos and dark energy grows with the value of the scalar cosmon field, the
evolution of neutrino lumps depends on the neutrino mass. For small masses the
lumps form and dissolve periodically, leaving only a small backreaction of the
neutrino structures on the cosmic evolution. This process heats the neutrinos
to temperatures much above the photon temperature such that neutrinos acquire
again an almost relativistic equation of state. The present equation of state
of the combined cosmon-neutrino fluid is very close to -1. In contrast, for
larger neutrino masses the lumps become stable. The highly concentrated
neutrino structures entail a large backreaction similar to the case of a
constant neutrino-cosmon coupling. A present average neutrino mass of around
0.5 eV seems so far compatible with observation. For masses lower than this
value, neutrino induced gravitational potentials remain small, making the lumps
difficult to detect.

astro-ph/9602104,astro-ph hep-ph,0.669194384660305,Neutrino decays as a natural explanation of the neutrino mass tension,"Can a ``natural'' three-generation neutrino mixing scheme satisfy
  everything?","  We examine the potential for a ``natural'' three-neutrino mixing scheme to
satisfy available data and astrophysical arguments. By ``natural'' we mean no
sterile neutrinos, and a neutrino mass hierarchy similar to that of the charged
leptons. We seek to satisfy (or solve): 1. Accelerator and reactor neutrino
oscillation constraints, including LSND; 2. The atmospheric muon neutrino
deficit problem; 3. The solar neutrino problem; 4. Supernova $r$-process
nucleosynthesis in neutrino-heated supernova ejecta; 5. Cold+hot dark matter
models. We argue that putative supernova $r$-process nucleosynthesis bounds on
two-neutrino flavor mixing can be applied directly to three-neutrino mixing in
the case where one vacuum neutrino mass eigenvalue difference dominates the
others. We show that in this ``one mass scale dominance'' limit, a natural
three-neutrino oscillation solution meeting all the above constraints exists
only if the atmospheric neutrino data {\em and} the LSND data can be explained
with one neutrino mass difference. In this model, an explanation for the solar
neutrino data can be effected by employing the {\em other} independent neutrino
mass difference. Such a solution is only marginally allowed by the current
data, and proposed long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments can
definitively rule it out. If it were ruled out, the simultaneous solution of
the above constraints by neutrino oscillations would then require sterile
neutrinos and/or a neutrino mass hierarchy of a different nature than that of
the charged leptons.

2205.15350,hep-ph hep-ex,0.6534839728189566,Neutrino decays as a natural explanation of the neutrino mass tension,The physics case for neutrino-neutrino collisions,"  Addressing the mass origin and properties of neutrinos is of strong interest
to particle physics, baryogenesis and cosmology. Popular explanations involve
physics beyond the standard model, for example, the dimension-5 Weinberg
operator or heavy Majorana neutrinos arising from ``seesaw'' models. The
current best direct limits on the electron neutrino mass, derived from nuclei
beta decay or neutrinoless double beta decay processes, are at the
sub-electronvolt level. Here we propose a novel neutrino neutrino collider
where the neutrino beam is generated from TeV scale muon decays. Such
collisions can happen between either neutrinos and anti-neutrinos, or neutrinos
and neutrinos. We find that with a tiny integrated luminosity of about
$10^{-5}$/fb we can already expect to observe direct neutrino anti-neutrino
annihilation, $\nu\bar{\nu}\rightarrow {\rm Z}$, which also opens the door to
explore neutrino related resonances $\nu\bar{\nu}\rightarrow {\rm X}$. The low
luminosity requirement can accommodate a relatively large emittance muon beam.
Such a device would also allow for probing heavy Majorana neutrino and
effective Majorana neutrino mass through $\nu\nu\rightarrow {\rm H H}$ to a
competitive level, for both electron and muon types.

2302.02717,hep-ex,0.6803664139134572,Neutrino decays as a natural explanation of the neutrino mass tension,Probing invisible neutrino decay with KM3NeT-ORCA,"  In the era of precision measurements of the neutrino oscillation parameters,
upcoming neutrino experiments will also be sensitive to physics beyond the
Standard Model. KM3NeT/ORCA is a neutrino detector optimised for measuring
atmospheric neutrinos from a few GeV to around 100 GeV. In this paper, the
sensitivity of the KM3NeT/ORCA detector to neutrino decay has been explored. A
three-flavour neutrino oscillation scenario, where the third neutrino mass
state $\nu_3$ decays into an invisible state, e.g. a sterile neutrino, is
considered. We find that KM3NeT/ORCA would be sensitive to invisible neutrino
decays with $1/\alpha_3=\tau_3/m_3 < 180$~$\mathrm{ps/eV}$ at $90\%$ confidence
level, assuming true normal ordering. Finally, the impact of neutrino decay on
the precision of KM3NeT/ORCA measurements for $\theta_{23}$, $\Delta m^2_{31}$
and mass ordering have been studied. No significant effect of neutrino decay on
the sensitivity to these measurements has been found.

in two event topologies: tracks and cascades. Since the flavor composition of
each event topology differs, tracks and cascades can be used to test the
neutrino properties and the mechanisms behind the neutrino production in
astrophysical sources. Assuming a conventional model for the neutrino
production, the IceCube data sets related to the two channels are in $>3\sigma$
tension with each other. Invisible neutrino decay with lifetime $\tau/m=10^2$
s/eV solves this tension. Noticeably, it leads to an improvement over the
standard non-decay scenario of more than $3\sigma$ while remaining consistent
with all other multi-messenger observations. In addition, our invisible
neutrino decay model predicts a reduction of $59\%$ in the number of observed
$\nu_\tau$ events which is consistent with the current observational deficit.

neutrino oscillation. These tensions hint at the possible existence of sterile
neutrinos. We briefly describe some of the diverse ideas for probing the
existence of such neutrinos in a definitive way through future experiments.
