text,quantum field theory gauge symmetry,1,1702.02027,22.888735,Quantum gauge symmetry of reducible gauge theory,"  We derive the gaugeon formalism of the Kalb-Ramond field theory, a reducible
gauge theory, which discusses the quantum gauge freedom. In gaugeon formalism,
theory admits quantum gauge symmetry which leaves the action form-invariant.
The BRST symmetric gaugeon formalism is also studied which introduces the
gaugeon ghost fields and gaugeon ghosts of ghosts fields. To replace the
Yokoyama subsidiary conditions by a single Kugo-Ojima type condition the virtue
of BRST symmetry is utilized. Under generalized BRST transformations, we show
that the gaugeon fields appear naturally in the reducible gauge theory.

text,quantum field theory gauge symmetry,2,2012.00009,22.554634,Chern-Weil Global Symmetries and How Quantum Gravity Avoids Them,"  We draw attention to a class of generalized global symmetries, which we call
""Chern-Weil global symmetries,"" that arise ubiquitously in gauge theories. The
Noether currents of these Chern-Weil global symmetries are given by wedge
products of gauge field strengths, such as $F_2 \wedge H_3$ and
$\text{tr}(F_2^2)$, and their conservation follows from Bianchi identities. As
a result, they are not easy to break. However, it is widely believed that exact
global symmetries are not allowed in a consistent theory of quantum gravity. As
a result, any Chern-Weil global symmetry in a low-energy effective field theory
must be either broken or gauged when the theory is coupled to gravity. In this
paper, we explore the processes by which Chern-Weil symmetries may be broken or
gauged in effective field theory and string theory. We will see that many
familiar phenomena in string theory, such as axions, Chern-Simons terms,
worldvolume degrees of freedom, and branes ending on or dissolving in other
branes, can be interpreted as consequences of the absence of Chern-Weil
symmetries in quantum gravity, suggesting that they might be general features
of quantum gravity. We further discuss implications of breaking and gauging
Chern-Weil symmetries for particle phenomenology and for boundary CFTs of AdS
bulk theories. Chern-Weil global symmetries thus offer a unified framework for
understanding many familiar aspects of quantum field theory and quantum
gravity.

text,quantum field theory gauge symmetry,3,1608.01515,22.501614,Gauge symmetry from decoupling,"  Gauge symmetries emerge from a redundant description of the effective action
for light degrees of freedom after the decoupling of heavy modes. This
redundant description avoids the use of explicit constraints in configuration
space. For non-linear constraints the gauge symmetries are non-linear. In a
quantum field theory setting the gauge symmetries are local and can describe
Yang-Mills theories or quantum gravity. We formulate gauge invariant fields
that correspond to the non-linear light degrees of freedom. In the context of
functional renormalization gauge symmetries can emerge if the flow generates or
preserves large mass-like terms for the heavy degrees of freedom. They
correspond to a particular form of gauge fixing terms in quantum field
theories.

text,quantum field theory gauge symmetry,4,2208.05973,22.473652,Universal Non-Invertible Symmetries,"  It is well-known that gauging a finite 0-form symmetry in a quantum field
theory leads to a dual symmetry generated by topological Wilson line defects.
These are described by the representations of the 0-form symmetry group which
form a 1-category. We argue that for a d-dimensional quantum field theory the
full set of dual symmetries one obtains is in fact much larger and is described
by a (d-1)-category, which is formed out of lower-dimensional topological
quantum field theories with the same 0-form symmetry. We study in detail a
2-categorical piece of this (d-1)-category described by 2d topological quantum
field theories with 0-form symmetry. We further show that the objects of this
2-category are the recently discussed 2d condensation defects constructed from
higher-gauging of Wilson lines. Similarly, dual symmetries obtained by gauging
any higher-form or higher-group symmetry also form a (d-1)-category formed out
of lower-dimensional topological quantum field theories with that higher-form
or higher-group symmetry. A particularly interesting case is that of the
2-category of dual symmetries associated to gauging of finite 2-group
symmetries, as it describes non-invertible symmetries arising from gauging
0-form symmetries that act on (d-3)-form symmetries. Such non-invertible
symmetries were studied recently in the literature via other methods, and our
results not only agree with previous results, but our approach also provides a
much simpler way of computing various properties of these non-invertible
symmetries. We describe how our results can be applied to compute
non-invertible symmetries of various classes of gauge theories with continuous
disconnected gauge groups in various spacetime dimensions. We also discuss the
2-category formed by 2d condensation defects in any arbitrary quantum field
theory.

text,quantum field theory gauge symmetry,7,1704.02330,21.985012,On finite symmetries and their gauging in two dimensions,"  It is well-known that if we gauge a $\mathbb{Z}_n$ symmetry in two
dimensions, a dual $\mathbb{Z}_n$ symmetry appears, such that re-gauging this
dual $\mathbb{Z}_n$ symmetry leads back to the original theory. We describe how
this can be generalized to non-Abelian groups, by enlarging the concept of
symmetries from those defined by groups to those defined by unitary fusion
categories. We will see that this generalization is also useful when studying
what happens when a non-anomalous subgroup of an anomalous finite group is
gauged: for example, the gauged theory can have non-Abelian group symmetry even
when the original symmetry is an Abelian group. We then discuss the
axiomatization of two-dimensional topological quantum field theories whose
symmetry is given by a category. We see explicitly that the gauged version is a
topological quantum field theory with a new symmetry given by a dual category.

text,quantum field theory gauge symmetry,8,0905.2320,21.95376,Classical and Quantum Theory with a New Symmetry,"  A formal symmetry between generalized coordinates and momenta is postulated
to formulate classical and quantum theories of a particle coupled to an Abelian
gauge field. It is shown that the symmetry (a) requires the field to have
dynamic degrees of freedom and to be a connection in a non-flat space-time
manifold, and (b) leads to a quantum theory free of the measurement problem. It
is speculated that gravitomagnetism could be a possible source of the gauge
field.

text,quantum field theory gauge symmetry,9,1107.4664,21.879555,Gauge symmetry breaking in gauge theories---In search of clarification,"  The paper investigates the spontaneous breaking of gauge symmetries in gauge
theories from a philosophical angle, taking into account the fact that the
notion of a spontaneously broken local gauge symmetry, though widely employed
in textbook expositions of the Higgs mechanism, is not supported by our leading
theoretical frameworks of gauge quantum theories. In the context of lattice
gauge theory, the statement that local gauge symmetry cannot be spontaneously
broken can even be made rigorous in the form of Elitzur's theorem.
Nevertheless, gauge symmetry breaking does occur in gauge quantum field
theories in the form of the breaking of remnant subgroups of the original local
gauge group under which the theories typically remain invariant after gauge
fixing. The paper discusses the relation between these instances of symmetry
breaking and phase transitions and draws some more general conclusions for the
philosophical interpretation of gauge symmetries and their breaking.

text,quantum field theory gauge symmetry,10,2301.10207,21.852575,Robustness of Gauge Digitization to Quantum Noise,"  Quantum noise limits the use of quantum memory in high energy physics
simulations. In particular, it breaks the gauge symmetry of stored quantum
states. We examine this effect for abelian and nonabelian theories and
demonstrate that optimizing the digitization of gauge theories to quantum
memory to account for noise channels can extend the lifetime before complete
loss of gauge symmetry by $2-10\times$ over some other digitizations. These
constructions also allow for quantum error correction to integrate the
symmetries of quantum fields and prioritize the largest gauge violations.

text,quantum field theory gauge symmetry,11,hep-th/9307164,21.85036,Quantum Symmetry,"  The representations of the observable algebra of a low dimensional quantum
field theory form the objects of a braided tensor category. The search for
gauge symmetry in the theory amounts to finding an algebra which has the same
representation category. In this paper we try to establish that every quantum
field theory satisfying some basic axioms posseses a weak quasi Hopf algebra as
gauge symmetry. The first step is to construct a functor from the
representation category to the category of finite dimensional vector spaces.
Given such a functor we can use a generalized reconstruction theorem to find
the symmetry algebra. It is shown how this symmetry algebra is used to build a
gauge covariant field algebra and we investigate the question why this
generality is necessary.

text,quantum field theory gauge symmetry,12,1904.11550,21.814533,Symmetry-Enriched Quantum Spin Liquids in $(3+1)d$,"  We use the intrinsic one-form and two-form global symmetries of (3+1)$d$
bosonic field theories to classify quantum phases enriched by ordinary
($0$-form) global symmetry. Different symmetry-enriched phases correspond to
different ways of coupling the theory to the background gauge field of the
ordinary symmetry. The input of the classification is the higher-form
symmetries and a permutation action of the $0$-form symmetry on the lines and
surfaces of the theory. From these data we classify the couplings to the
background gauge field by the 0-form symmetry defects constructed from the
higher-form symmetry defects. For trivial two-form symmetry the classification
coincides with the classification for symmetry fractionalizations in $(2+1)d$.
We also provide a systematic method to obtain the symmetry protected
topological phases that can be absorbed by the coupling, and we give the
relative 't Hooft anomaly for different couplings. We discuss several examples
including the gapless pure $U(1)$ gauge theory and the gapped Abelian finite
group gauge theory. As an application, we discover a tension with a conjectured
duality in $(3+1)d$ for $SU(2)$ gauge theory with two adjoint Weyl fermions.

text,quantum field theory gauge symmetry,13,hep-th/0703189,21.783089,Quantum Effects in Softly Broken Gauge Theories in Curved Space-Times,"  The soft breaking of gauge or other symmetries is the typical Quantum Field
Theory phenomenon. In many cases one can apply the St$\ddot{\rm u}$ckelberg
procedure, which means introducing some additional field or fields and restore
the gauge symmetry. The original softly broken theory corresponds to a
particular choice of the gauge fixing condition. In this paper we use this
scheme for performing quantum calculations for some softly broken gauge
theories in an arbitrary curved space-time. The following examples are treated
in details: Proca field, massive QED and massive torsion coupled to fermion.
Furthermore we present a qualitative discussions of the discontinuity of
quantum effects in the massive spin-2 field theory, paying special attention to
the similarity and differences with the massless limit in the spin-1 case.

symmetry and gravitational field appears as gauge field. The problems on
quantization and renormalization of the theory are also discussed in this

gives out classical Newton's theory of gravity. In first order approximation
and for vacuum, the gravitational gauge field theory gives out Einstein's
general theory of relativity. This quantum gauge theory of gravity is a

text,quantum field theory gauge symmetry,15,hep-th/0206234,21.75781,"On quantum deformation of conformal symmetry: Gauge dependence via field
  redefinitions","  The effective action in gauge theories is known to depend on a choice of
gauge fixing conditions. This dependence is such that any change of gauge
conditions is equivalent to a field redefinition in the effective action. In
this sense, the quantum deformation of conformal symmetry in the N = 4 super
Yang-Mills theory, which was computed in 't Hooft gauge in hep-th/9808039 and
hep-th/0203236, is gauge dependent. The deformation is an intrinsic property of
the theory in that it cannot be eliminated by a local choice of gauge (although
we sketch a field redefinition induced by a nonlocal gauge which, on the
Coulomb branch of the theory, converts the one-loop quantum-corrected conformal
transformations to the classical ones). We explicitly compute the deformed
conformal symmetry in R_\xi gauge. The conformal transformation law of the
gauge field turns out to be \xi-independent. We construct the scalar field
redefinition which relates the 't Hooft and R_\xi gauge results. A unique
feature of 't Hooft gauge is that it makes it possible to consistently truncate
the one-loop conformal deformation to the terms of first order in derivatives
of the fields such that the corresponding transformations form a field
realization of the conformal algebra.

text,quantum field theory gauge symmetry,16,2503.04546,21.738684,Symmetry Topological Field Theory for Flavor Symmetry,"  In this Letter, we demonstrate that the Symmetry Topological Field Theory
(SymTFT) associated to a Quantum Field Theory (QFT) with continuous non-abelian
$G$-flavor symmetry is a $BF$-theory with gauge group $G$. We show that gauging
$G$-symmetry with a flat connection yields a theory with global symmetry
characterized by exchanging the conjugate variables in the quantization of
$BF$-theory. We construct the extended operators that generate the $G$-flavor
symmetry and the $(d-2)$-form $\text{Rep}(G)$-symmetry of the gauged QFT. We
demonstrate that $BF$-theory arises as the theory characterizing $G$-flavor
symmetry of a QFT in the AdS/CFT setup. 't Hooft anomalies of the $G$-flavor
symmetry are realized as extra terms in the action.

text,quantum field theory gauge symmetry,18,1011.5120,21.662767,Symmetries and Strings in Field Theory and Gravity,"  We discuss aspects of global and gauged symmetries in quantum field theory
and quantum gravity, focusing on discrete gauge symmetries. An effective
Lagrangian description of $\Z_p$ gauge theories shows that they are associated
with an emergent $\Z_p$ one-form (Kalb-Ramond) gauge symmetry. This
understanding leads us to uncover new observables and new phenomena in
nonlinear $\sigma$-models. It also allows us to expand on Polchinski's
classification of cosmic strings. We argue that in models of quantum gravity,
there are no global symmetries, all continuous gauge symmetries are compact,
and all charges allowed by Dirac quantization are present in the spectrum.
These conjectures are not new, but we present them from a streamlined and
unified perspective. Finally, our discussion about string charges and
symmetries leads to a more physical and more complete understanding of recently
found consistency conditions of supergravity.

text,quantum field theory gauge symmetry,19,2211.04461,21.651537,Lower-Form Symmetries,"  When gauging a $(d-1)$-form symmetry in $d$ spacetime dimensions, one
formally expects the gauged theory to carry a dual $-1$-form symmetry. This
work focuses on the study of such symmetries, in particular via the
spacetime-filling topological operators that implement them, in two-dimensional
field theory (with an eye towards general quantum field theory). As theories
with $(d-1)$-form symmetries are known to be equivalent to direct sums of local
theories, we review how gauging a $(d-1)$-form symmetry projects onto a single
component in this sum, and explain how gauging the resulting $-1$-form symmetry
restores the direct sum.

text,quantum field theory gauge symmetry,20,2103.01000,21.600487,Duality Symmetry of Quantum Electrodynamics and Magnetic Charges,"  The duality symmetry between electricity and magnetism hidden in classical
Maxwell equations suggests the existence of dual charges, which have usually
been interpreted as magnetic charges and have not been observed in experiments.
In quantum electrodynamics (QED), both the electric and magnetic fields have
been unified into one gauge field, which makes this symmetry inconspicuous.
Here, we recheck the duality symmetry of QED by introducing a dual gauge field
and a dual symmetric Lagrangian. Within the framework of gauge-field theory, we
show that the electric-magnetic duality symmetry cannot give any new
conservation law. By checking the charge-charge interaction and the quantum
Lorentz-force equation, we find that the introduced dual charges are electric
charges, not magnetic charges. More importantly, we show that true magnetic
charges are not compatible with the gauge-field theory of QED, because the
interaction between a magnetic charge and an electric charge cannot be mediated
via the exchange of gauge photons.
