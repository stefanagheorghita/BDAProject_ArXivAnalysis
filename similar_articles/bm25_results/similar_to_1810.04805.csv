broke through the limitation of only using one-way methods for language

bidirectional context information to predict the masked words in the sequence,
this can improve the feature extraction ability of the model. This makes the
model very useful for downstream tasks, especially for specialized

the domain knowledge and be better applied to these downstream tasks. So we
hope to help understand how this technology has evolved and improved model

",14,1909.12486,180.49284,Reweighted Proximal Pruning for Large-Scale Language Representation,"  Recently, pre-trained language representation flourishes as the mainstay of
the natural language understanding community, e.g., BERT. These pre-trained
language representations can create state-of-the-art results on a wide range of
downstream tasks. Along with continuous significant performance improvement,
the size and complexity of these pre-trained neural models continue to increase
rapidly. Is it possible to compress these large-scale language representation
models? How will the pruned language representation affect the downstream
multi-task transfer learning objectives? In this paper, we propose Reweighted
Proximal Pruning (RPP), a new pruning method specifically designed for a
large-scale language representation model. Through experiments on SQuAD and the
GLUE benchmark suite, we show that proximal pruned BERT keeps high accuracy for
both the pre-training task and the downstream multiple fine-tuning tasks at
high prune ratio. RPP provides a new perspective to help us analyze what
large-scale language representation might learn. Additionally, RPP makes it
possible to deploy a large state-of-the-art language representation model such
as BERT on a series of distinct devices (e.g., online servers, mobile phones,
and edge devices).

incorporating language structures into pre-training. Specifically, we pre-train
StructBERT with two auxiliary tasks to make the most of the sequential order of
words and sentences, which leverage language structures at the word and
sentence levels, respectively. As a result, the new model is adapted to
different levels of language understanding required by downstream tasks. The
StructBERT with structural pre-training gives surprisingly good empirical
results on a variety of downstream tasks, including pushing the
state-of-the-art on the GLUE benchmark to 89.0 (outperforming all published

results demonstrate that pre-training models using the proposed approach
followed by fine-tuning achieve significant improvements over previous
state-of-the-art models on two commonsense-related benchmarks, including
CommonsenseQA and Winograd Schema Challenge. We also observe that fine-tuned
models after the proposed pre-training approach maintain comparable performance
on other NLP tasks, such as sentence classification and natural language
inference tasks, compared to the original BERT models. These results verify
that the proposed approach, while significantly improving commonsense-related
NLP tasks, does not degrade the general language representation capabilities.

self-supervised VL pre-training at patches of different scale. Kaleido-BERT is
conceptually simple and easy to extend to the existing BERT framework, it
attains new state-of-the-art results by large margins on four downstream tasks,
including text retrieval (R@1: 4.03% absolute improvement), image retrieval

Methods: Bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) models
were trained with varying data sources to perform SQuAD 2.0 style why-question
answering (why-QA) on clinical notes. The evaluation focused on: 1) comparing
the merits from different training data, 2) error analysis. Results: The best
model achieved an accuracy of 0.707 (or 0.760 by partial match). Training
toward customization for the clinical language helped increase 6% in accuracy.
Discussion: The error analysis suggested that the model did not really perform
deep reasoning and that clinical why-QA might warrant more sophisticated
solutions. Conclusion: The BERT model achieved moderate accuracy in clinical
why-QA and should benefit from the rapidly evolving technology. Despite the
identified limitations, it could serve as a competent proxy for question-driven
clinical information extraction.
