text,graph neural networks for citation analysis,1,2104.02562,22.66139,Structured Citation Trend Prediction Using Graph Neural Networks,"  Academic citation graphs represent citation relationships between
publications across the full range of academic fields. Top cited papers
typically reveal future trends in their corresponding domains which is of
importance to both researchers and practitioners. Prior citation prediction
methods often require initial citation trends to be established and do not take
advantage of the recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs). We
present GNN-based architecture that predicts the top set of papers at the time
of publication. For experiments, we curate a set of academic citation graphs
for a variety of conferences and show that the proposed model outperforms other
classic machine learning models in terms of the F1-score.

text,graph neural networks for citation analysis,2,2305.01572,21.45781,H2CGL: Modeling Dynamics of Citation Network for Impact Prediction,"  The potential impact of a paper is often quantified by how many citations it
will receive. However, most commonly used models may underestimate the
influence of newly published papers over time, and fail to encapsulate this
dynamics of citation network into the graph. In this study, we construct
hierarchical and heterogeneous graphs for target papers with an annual
perspective. The constructed graphs can record the annual dynamics of target
papers' scientific context information. Then, a novel graph neural network,
Hierarchical and Heterogeneous Contrastive Graph Learning Model (H2CGL), is
proposed to incorporate heterogeneity and dynamics of the citation network.
H2CGL separately aggregates the heterogeneous information for each year and
prioritizes the highly-cited papers and relationships among references,
citations, and the target paper. It then employs a weighted GIN to capture
dynamics between heterogeneous subgraphs over years. Moreover, it leverages
contrastive learning to make the graph representations more sensitive to
potential citations. Particularly, co-cited or co-citing papers of the target
paper with large citation gap are taken as hard negative samples, while
randomly dropping low-cited papers could generate positive samples. Extensive
experimental results on two scholarly datasets demonstrate that the proposed
H2CGL significantly outperforms a series of baseline approaches for both
previously and freshly published papers. Additional analyses highlight the
significance of the proposed modules. Our codes and settings have been released
on Github (https://github.com/ECNU-Text-Computing/H2CGL)

text,graph neural networks for citation analysis,3,2202.11360,21.123756,Deep Graph Learning for Anomalous Citation Detection,"  Anomaly detection is one of the most active research areas in various
critical domains, such as healthcare, fintech, and public security. However,
little attention has been paid to scholarly data, i.e., anomaly detection in a
citation network. Citation is considered as one of the most crucial metrics to
evaluate the impact of scientific research, which may be gamed in multiple
ways. Therefore, anomaly detection in citation networks is of significant
importance to identify manipulation and inflation of citations. To address this
open issue, we propose a novel deep graph learning model, namely GLAD (Graph
Learning for Anomaly Detection), to identify anomalies in citation networks.
GLAD incorporates text semantic mining to network representation learning by
adding both node attributes and link attributes via graph neural networks. It
exploits not only the relevance of citation contents but also hidden
relationships between papers. Within the GLAD framework, we propose an
algorithm called CPU (Citation PUrpose) to discover the purpose of citation
based on citation texts. The performance of GLAD is validated through a
simulated anomalous citation dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of GLAD on the anomalous citation detection task.

  Top-m Attention Mechanism for Graph Representation Learning","  In the field of deep learning, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Graph
Transformer models, with their outstanding performance and flexible
architectural designs, have become leading technologies for processing
structured data, especially graph data. Traditional GNNs often face challenges
in capturing information from distant vertices effectively. In contrast, Graph
Transformer models are particularly adept at managing long-distance node

encounter issues with computational and storage efficiency when scaled to large

aggregation component and a neighborhood aggregation component, effectively
enhancing the model's ability to aggregate relevant information from both local

computational efficiency but also enriches the node features, facilitating a
deeper analysis of complex graph structures. Additionally, to assess the
effectiveness of our proposed model, we have applied it to citation sentiment
prediction, a novel task previously unexplored in the GNN field. Accordingly,
we constructed a dedicated citation network, ArXivNet. In this dataset, we
specifically annotated the sentiment polarity of the citations (positive,
neutral, negative) to enable in-depth sentiment analysis. Our approach has
shown superior performance across a variety of tasks including vertex
classification, link prediction, sentiment prediction, graph regression, and
visualization. It outperforms existing methods in terms of effectiveness, as
demonstrated by experimental results on multiple datasets.

  Relate Uncited Papers On Grounds of Citation Proximity","  Citation based approaches have seen good progress for recommending research
papers using citations in the paper. Citation proximity analysis which uses the
in-text citation proximity to find relatedness between two research papers is
better than co-citation analysis and bibliographic analysis. However, one
common problem which exists in each approach is that paper should be well
cited. If documents are not cited properly or not cited at all, then using
these approaches will not be helpful. To overcome the problem, this paper
discusses the approach Virtual Citation Proximity (VCP) which uses Siamese
Neural Network along with the notion of citation proximity analysis and
content-based filtering. To train this model, the actual distance between the
two citations in a document is used as ground truth, this distance is the word
count between the two citations. VCP is trained on Wikipedia articles for which
the actual word count is available which is used to calculate the similarity
between the documents. This can be used to calculate relatedness between two
documents in a way they would have been cited in the proximity even if the
documents are uncited. This approach has shown a great improvement in
predicting proximity with basic neural networks over the approach which uses
the Average Citation Proximity index value as the ground truth. This can be
improved by using a complex neural network and proper hyper tuning of
parameters.

We propose a Graph-Neural-Network (GNN) link prediction model that can identify Case-Law and Case-Case citations with high proficiency through fusion of semantic and topological information. We introduce adapted relational graph convolutions operating on an extended and enriched version of the original citation graph that allow the topological integration of semantic meta-information. This further improves prediction by 3.1 points of average precision and by 8.5 points in data sparsity as well as showing robust performance over time and in challenging fully inductive prediction.

theoretical analysis of how GraphMix improves the generalization bounds of the
underlying graph neural network, without making any assumptions about the
""aggregation"" layer or the depth of the graph neural networks. We
experimentally validate this analysis by applying GraphMix to various
architectures such as Graph Convolutional Networks, Graph Attention Networks
and Graph-U-Net. Despite its simplicity, we demonstrate that GraphMix can
consistently improve or closely match state-of-the-art performance using even

  Network Link Prediction","  Graph neural network (GNN) link prediction is increasingly deployed in
citation, collaboration, and online social networks to recommend academic
literature, collaborators, and friends. While prior research has investigated
the dyadic fairness of GNN link prediction, the within-group (e.g., queer
women) fairness and ""rich get richer"" dynamics of link prediction remain
underexplored. However, these aspects have significant consequences for degree
and power imbalances in networks. In this paper, we shed light on how degree
bias in networks affects Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) link prediction. In
particular, we theoretically uncover that GCNs with a symmetric normalized
graph filter have a within-group preferential attachment bias. We validate our
theoretical analysis on real-world citation, collaboration, and online social
networks. We further bridge GCN's preferential attachment bias with unfairness
in link prediction and propose a new within-group fairness metric. This metric
quantifies disparities in link prediction scores within social groups, towards
combating the amplification of degree and power disparities. Finally, we
propose a simple training-time strategy to alleviate within-group unfairness,
and we show that it is effective on citation, social, and credit networks.

text,graph neural networks for citation analysis,10,2012.05742,19.60185,Longitudinal Citation Prediction using Temporal Graph Neural Networks,"  Citation count prediction is the task of predicting the number of citations a
paper has gained after a period of time. Prior work viewed this as a static
prediction task. As papers and their citations evolve over time, considering
the dynamics of the number of citations a paper will receive would seem
logical. Here, we introduce the task of sequence citation prediction. The goal
is to accurately predict the trajectory of the number of citations a scholarly
work receives over time. We propose to view papers as a structured network of
citations, allowing us to use topological information as a learning signal.
Additionally, we learn how this dynamic citation network changes over time and
the impact of paper meta-data such as authors, venues and abstracts. To
approach the new task, we derive a dynamic citation network from Semantic
Scholar spanning over 42 years. We present a model which exploits topological
and temporal information using graph convolution networks paired with sequence
prediction, and compare it against multiple baselines, testing the importance
of topological and temporal information and analyzing model performance. Our
experiments show that leveraging both the temporal and topological information
greatly increases the performance of predicting citation counts over time.

However, effectively combining multiple data views requires fusion techniques that can capture complementary information while preserving the unique characteristics of each modality. We propose a novel citation recommendation algorithm that improves upon linear Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) methods by applying Deep CCA (DCCA), a neural network extension capable of capturing complex, non-linear relationships between distributed textual and graph-based representations of scientific articles. Experiments on the large-scale DBLP (Digital Bibliography & Library Project) citation network dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art CCA-based methods, achieving relative improvements of over 11% in Mean Average Precision@10, 5% in Precision@10, and 7% in Recall@10.

articles. Processing the data obtained from the Web of Science database,
metrics such as the type of the articles, funding availability, indexing type,
annual average number of citations and the number of access were analyzed to
quantitatively reveal the effects on the scientific audience. It's outlined
that deep learning-based studies gained momentum after year 2013, and the rate
of graph-based approaches in all deep learning studies increased linearly from
1% to 4% within the following 10 years. Conference publications scanned in the
Conference Proceeding Citation Index (CPCI) on the graph-based approaches
receive significantly more citations. The citation counts of the SCI-Expanded
and Emerging SCI indexed publications of the two streams are close to each
other. While the citation performances of the supported and unsupported
publications of the two sides were similar, pure deep learning studies received
more citations on the journal publication side and graph-based approaches
received more citations on the conference side. Despite their similar
performance in recent years, graph-based studies show twice more citation
performance as they get older, compared to traditional approaches. Annual
average citation performance per article for all deep learning studies is
11.051 in 2014, while it is 22.483 for graph-based studies. Also, despite

prior work as conventional or innovative and to derive features of highly cited
publications. Given the organization of science into disciplines, a key
question is the sensitivity of such analyses to frame of reference. Our study
examines this question using semantically-themed citation networks. We observe

text,graph neural networks for citation analysis,14,2007.09296,19.46412,Towards Deeper Graph Neural Networks,"  Graph neural networks have shown significant success in the field of graph
representation learning. Graph convolutions perform neighborhood aggregation
and represent one of the most important graph operations. Nevertheless, one
layer of these neighborhood aggregation methods only consider immediate
neighbors, and the performance decreases when going deeper to enable larger
receptive fields. Several recent studies attribute this performance
deterioration to the over-smoothing issue, which states that repeated
propagation makes node representations of different classes indistinguishable.
In this work, we study this observation systematically and develop new insights
towards deeper graph neural networks. First, we provide a systematical analysis
on this issue and argue that the key factor compromising the performance
significantly is the entanglement of representation transformation and
propagation in current graph convolution operations. After decoupling these two
operations, deeper graph neural networks can be used to learn graph node
representations from larger receptive fields. We further provide a theoretical
analysis of the above observation when building very deep models, which can
serve as a rigorous and gentle description of the over-smoothing issue. Based
on our theoretical and empirical analysis, we propose Deep Adaptive Graph
Neural Network (DAGNN) to adaptively incorporate information from large
receptive fields. A set of experiments on citation, co-authorship, and
co-purchase datasets have confirmed our analysis and insights and demonstrated
the superiority of our proposed methods.
