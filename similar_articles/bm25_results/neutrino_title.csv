exchange, which provide evidence for the Majorana nature of neutrinos. In
addition to the natural explanation of the small neutrino masses, Type-I seesaw
mechanism predicts the existence of Majorana neutrinos. The aim of this work is
to study the B meson rare decays $B^{+} \to K^{(*)+}\mu^+\mu^-$ in the standard
model and its extensions, and then to investigate the same-sign decay processes
$B^{+}\to K^{(*)-}\mu^{+}\mu^+$. The corresponding dilepton invariant mass
distributions are predicted. It is found that the dilepton angular
distributions illustrate the properties of new interactions induced by the
Majorana neutrinos.

  Hubble tension","  The Hubble tension can be significantly eased if there is an early component
of dark energy that becomes active around the time of matter-radiation
equality. Early dark energy models suffer from a coincidence problem -- the
physics of matter-radiation equality and early dark energy are completely
disconnected, so some degree of fine-tuning is needed in order for them to
occur nearly simultaneously. In this paper we propose a natural explanation for
this coincidence. If the early dark energy scalar couples to neutrinos then it
receives a large injection of energy around the time that neutrinos become
non-relativistic. This is precisely when their temperature is of order their
mass, which, coincidentally, occurs around the time of matter-radiation
equality. Neutrino decoupling therefore provides a natural trigger for early
dark energy by displacing the field from its minimum just before
matter-radiation equality. We discuss various theoretical aspects of this
proposal, potential observational signatures, and future directions for its
study.

the rare kaon decay $K\to\pi\nu\nu$, and its consequences for radiative
neutrino mass generation and the washout of Lepton asymmetry in high-scale
leptogenesis scenarios. We perform the analysis in a model-independent
framework, the Standard Model effective field theory (SMEFT), and discuss the
possible LNV nature of the rare kaon decay in the context of the currently
operating NA62 experiment at CERN. We find that, in case of a LNV interaction,
its detection would put high-scale leptogenesis under tension and would hint to
small radiatively generated neutrino masses.

text,Neutrino decays as a natural explanation of the neutrino mass tension,4,1707.01725,32.121326,Searching for heavy sterile neutrinos in kaon decays,"  We present here a study of the impact of a heavy neutrino (or heavy neutral
lepton) on leptonic and semileptonic kaon decays. We used a simplified model
consisting of 3 light neutrinos responsible for neutrino oscillations and a
heavy sterile neutrino. We found that it can lead to large deviations from the
Standard Model predictions for leptonic decays, in conflict with experimental
measurements of $K_{e2}$ and the lepton universality test $R_K$. This allows to
derive new constraints on the leptonic mixing for heavy sterile neutrinos. No
tension was found when considering the semileptonic decays. Finally, we point
out the potential of the decay $K_L \rightarrow \nu \nu$ as a clear signature
of physics beyond the Standard Model.

recently proposed explanation of the LSND and MiniBooNE anomalies, given in
terms of a sterile neutrino $N$ whose decay is dominated by a radiative mode.
We find that current experimental data on $\tau\rightarrow \mu\nu\nu\gamma$
decays are compatible with the sterile neutrino parameters required for the
explanation of the anomalies, but $K\rightarrow \mu\nu\gamma$ shows a marginal
tension with those parameters. We also propose experimental cuts on radiative
$K$ decays that could test the sterile neutrino hypothesis better. Finally, we
study the contribution of this sterile neutrino to $K\to\mu\nu e e$, and find
that measurements of this process would provide powerful tests for the sterile
neutrino explanation of the LSND and MiniBooNE anomalies, if the experimental
cut on the invariant mass of the $e^{+}e^{-}$ pair could be reduced from its
current value of 145 MeV to a value below 40 MeV.

hierarchy problem and (ii) an explanation of both the atmospheric and solar
neutrino problems, lead to an essentially unique picture of neutrino masses and
mixing angles. The electron and muon neutrinos are quasi-degenerate in mass
with maximal mixing, giving $\nu_e - \nu_{\mu}$ vacuum oscillations. The
overall neutrino mass scale is set by the atmospheric neutrino requirement
$\Delta m^2 \sim 10^{-2}$ eV$^2$, implying a mass for $\nu_e$ and $\nu_{\mu}$
of order 1 eV in models with a natural mass hierarchy, whilst the tau neutrino
is expected to be much lighter than this and only weakly mixed. We present an
explicit example based on the anti-grand unification model of fermion masses.

text,Neutrino decays as a natural explanation of the neutrino mass tension,7,2209.13455,31.458288,Testing Explanations of Short Baseline Neutrino Anomalies,"  The experimental observation of neutrino oscillations profoundly impacted the
physics of neutrinos, from being well understood theoretically to requiring new
physics beyond the standard model of particle physics. Indeed, the mystery of
neutrino masses implies the presence of new particles never observed before,
often called sterile neutrinos, as they would not undergo standard weak
interactions. And while neutrino oscillation measurements entered the precision
era, reaching percent-level precision, many experimental results show
significant discrepancies with the standard model, at baselines much shorter
than typical oscillation baselines, like LSND, MiniBooNE, gallium experiments,
and reactor antineutrino measurements. These short baseline anomalies could be
explained by the addition of a light sterile neutrino, with mass in the
$1-10~\text{eV}$ range, however, in strong tension with many null experimental
observations. Other explanations that rely on sterile neutrinos with masses in
the $1-500~\text{MeV}$ could resolve the tension. Here we test both classes of
models. On the one hand, we look for datasets collected at a short baseline
which can constrain heavy sterile neutrino models. We find that the minimal
model is fully constrained, but several extensions of this model could weaken
the current constraint and be tested with current and future datasets. On the
other hand, we test the presence of neutrino oscillations at short baselines,
induced by a light sterile state, with the data collected by the MicroBooNE
experiment, a liquid argon time projection chamber specifically designed to
resolve the details of each neutrino interaction. We report null results from
both analyses, further constraining the space of possible explanations for the
short baseline anomalies. If new physics lies behind the short baseline anomaly
puzzle, it is definitely not described by a simple model.

text,Neutrino decays as a natural explanation of the neutrino mass tension,8,2011.14481,31.445885,Cosmological bound on neutrino masses in the light of $H_0$ tension,"  Although cosmic microwave background (CMB) is the most powerful cosmological
probe of neutrino masses, it is in trouble with local direct measurements of
$H_0$, which is called the $H_0$ tension. Since neutrino masses are correlated
with $H_0$ in CMB, one can expect the cosmological bound on neutrino masses
would be much affected by the $H_0$ tension. We investigate what impact this
tension brings to cosmological bound on neutrino masses by assuming a model
with modified recombination which has been shown to resolve the tension. We
argue that constraints on neutrino masses become significantly weaker in models
where the $H_0$ tension can be resolved.

text,Neutrino decays as a natural explanation of the neutrino mass tension,9,1604.06099,30.984724,Shedding Light on Neutrino Masses with Dark Forces,"  Heavy right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) provide the simplest explanation for the
origin of light neutrino masses and mixings. If the RHN masses are at or below
the weak scale, direct experimental discovery of these states is possible at
accelerator experiments such as the LHC or new dedicated beam dump experiments;
in such experiments, the RHN decays after traversing a macroscopic distance
from the collision point. The experimental sensitivity to RHNs is significantly
enhanced if there is a new ""dark"" gauge force connecting them to the Standard
Model (SM), and detection of RHNs can be the primary discovery mode for the new
dark force itself. We take the well-motivated example of a B-L gauge symmetry
and analyze the sensitivity to displaced decays of the RHNs produced via the
new gauge interaction in two experiments: the LHC and the proposed SHiP beam
dump experiment. In the most favorable case in which the mediator can be
produced on-shell and decays to RHNs, the sensitivity reach is controlled by
the square of the B-L gauge coupling. We demonstrate that these experiments
could access neutrino parameters responsible for the observed SM neutrino
masses and mixings in the most straightforward implementation of the see-saw
mechanism.

  natural grand unified theories","  The natural grand unified theories solve various problems of the
supersymmetric grand unified theory and give realistic quark and lepton mass
matrices under the natural assumption that all terms allowed by the symmetry
are introduced with O(1) coefficients. However, because of the natural
assumption, it is difficult to achieve the gauge coupling unification without
tuning, while keeping neutrino masses at realistic values. In this paper, we
try to avoid this tension between the neutrino masses and the gauge coupling
unification, by introducing suppression factors for several terms. These
suppression factors can be understood by approximate symmetries in some of the
solutions. We show that one of the most important results in the natural GUT
scenario, that the nucleon decay mediated by superheavy gauge fields is
enhanced due to smaller unification scale while the nucleon decay mediated by
superheavy colored Higgs is suppressed, can change in those models proposed in
this paper.

  everything?","  We examine the potential for a ``natural'' three-neutrino mixing scheme to
satisfy available data and astrophysical arguments. By ``natural'' we mean no
sterile neutrinos, and a neutrino mass hierarchy similar to that of the charged
leptons. We seek to satisfy (or solve): 1. Accelerator and reactor neutrino
oscillation constraints, including LSND; 2. The atmospheric muon neutrino
deficit problem; 3. The solar neutrino problem; 4. Supernova $r$-process
nucleosynthesis in neutrino-heated supernova ejecta; 5. Cold+hot dark matter
models. We argue that putative supernova $r$-process nucleosynthesis bounds on
two-neutrino flavor mixing can be applied directly to three-neutrino mixing in
the case where one vacuum neutrino mass eigenvalue difference dominates the
others. We show that in this ``one mass scale dominance'' limit, a natural
three-neutrino oscillation solution meeting all the above constraints exists
only if the atmospheric neutrino data {\em and} the LSND data can be explained
with one neutrino mass difference. In this model, an explanation for the solar
neutrino data can be effected by employing the {\em other} independent neutrino
mass difference. Such a solution is only marginally allowed by the current
data, and proposed long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments can
definitively rule it out. If it were ruled out, the simultaneous solution of
the above constraints by neutrino oscillations would then require sterile
neutrinos and/or a neutrino mass hierarchy of a different nature than that of
the charged leptons.

on the pion, kaon and lepton decays that if three generations of neutrinos are
assumed to be massive and mixed, the heaviest neutrino, $\nu_3$, could have a
mass in the range, $155~\mbox{MeV} \lsim m_3 \lsim 225~\mbox{MeV}$, we have
analyzed the latest 1995 data on the leptonic decays of pion, $\mu$ and $\tau$
with the assumption that three generations of neutrinos are massive and mixed.
It is shown that when the radiative corrections are included and the constraint
{}from partial decay widths is imposed, the 1995 data are consistent with three
massless neutrinos with no mixing. Various limits on the neutrino mass and
mixing angle implied by the 1995 data are presented together with a critique of
the previous analysis.

text,Neutrino decays as a natural explanation of the neutrino mass tension,13,1205.1791,30.702211,Neutrino Phenomenology in a 3+1+1 Framework,"  Evidence continues to grow in the MiniBooNE (MB) antineutrino mode supporting
a low-energy excess compatible with the MB neutrino mode and possibly also
confirming the results of the LSND experiment. At least one sterile neutrino is
required to explain the anomalies consistent with the observations of other
experiments. At the same time, there is a strong tension between the positive
signals of LSND and MB and the null results of nu_e and nu_mu disappearance
experiments. We explore a scenario, first proposed in \cite{Nelson:2010hz},
where the presence of an additional heavy sterile neutrino (with mass well
above an eV) can alleviate tension between LSND, MB and the null results of
disappearance experiments. We compare and contrast this 3+1+1 scenario with the
more standard 3+1 scenario and carry out global fits to all oscillation data
including new 2011 MB anti-nu data. We find that the tension can be somewhat
alleviated and that a phenomenologically viable window for the heavy neutrino,
consistent with rare decays and BBN constraints, can be found if the fifth
neutrino has a mass of order 0.3 - 10 GeV. We also find, however, that the 2011
MB anti-nu data exacerbates the tension with null experiments in both the 3+1
and 3+1+1 models when the lowest energy bins are included, resulting in little
improvement in the global fit. We also discuss the implications of an
additional neutrino for the reactor and gallium anomalies, and show that an
oscillation explanation of the anomalies is disfavored by cosmological
considerations, direct searches, and precision electroweak tests.

investigated in the context of global neutrino oscillation data including short
and long-baseline accelerator, reactor, and radioactive source experiments, as
well as atmospheric and solar neutrinos. We consider sterile neutrino mass
schemes involving one or two mass-squared differences at the eV^2 scale denoted
by 3+1, 3+2, and 1+3+1. We discuss the hints for eV-scale neutrinos from nu_e
disappearance (reactor and Gallium anomalies) and nu_mu->nu_e appearance (LSND
and MiniBooNE) searches, and we present constraints on sterile neutrino mixing
from nu_mu and neutral-current disappearance data. An explanation of all hints
in terms of oscillations suffers from severe tension between appearance and
disappearance data. The best compatibility is obtained in the 1+3+1 scheme with
a p-value of 0.2% and exceedingly worse compatibilities in the 3+1 and 3+2

  and Independent of the Right-Handed Neutrino Mass","  The common lore in the literature of neutrino mass generation is that the
canonical see-saw mechanism beautifully offers an explanation for the tiny
neutrino mass but at the cost of introducing right-handed neutrinos at a scale
that is out of range for the current experiments. The inverse see-saw mechanism
is an interesting alternative to the canonical one once it leads to tiny
neutrino masses with the advantage of being testable at TeV scale. However,
this last mechanism suffers from an issue of naturalness concerning the scale
responsible for such small masses, namely, the parameter $\mu$ that is related
to lepton number violation and is supposed to be at the keV scale, much lower
than the electroweak one. However, no theoretical framework was built that
offers an explanation for obtaining this specific scale. In this work we
propose a variation of the inverse see-saw mechanism by assuming a minimal
scalar and fermionic set of singlet fields, along with a $Z_5\otimes Z_2$
symmetry, that allows a dynamical explanation for the smallness of $\mu$,
recovering the neat canonical see-saw formula and with right-handed (RH)
neutrinos free to be at the electroweak scale, thus testable at LHC and current
neutrino experiments.

  mass","  We reconsider a model introducing a scalar leptoquark $\phi \sim (\mathbf{3},
\mathbf{1}, -1/3)$ to explain recent deviations from the standard model in
semileptonic $B$ decays. The leptoquark can accommodate the persistent tension
in the decays $\bar{B}\rightarrow D^{(*)}\tau \bar{\nu}$ as long as its mass is
lower than approximately $10 \text{ TeV}$, and we show that a sizeable Yukawa
coupling to the right-chiral tau lepton is necessary for an acceptable
explanation. Agreement with the measured $\bar{B}\rightarrow D^{(*)}\tau
\bar{\nu}$ rates is mildly compromised for parameter choices addressing the
tensions in $b \to s \mu \mu$, where the model can significantly reduce the
discrepancies in angular observables, branching ratios and the
lepton-flavor-universality observables $R_K$ and $R_{K^*}$. The leptoquark can
also reconcile the predicted and measured value of the anomalous magnetic
moment of the muon and appears naturally in models of radiative neutrino mass
derived from lepton-number violating effective operators. As a representative
example, we incorporate the particle into an existing two-loop neutrino mass
scenario derived from a dimension-nine operator. In this specific model, the
structure of the neutrino mass matrix provides enough freedom to explain the
small masses of the neutrinos in the region of parameter space dictated by
agreement with the anomalies in $\bar{B}\rightarrow D^{(*)}\tau \bar{\nu}$, but
not the $b \to s$ transition. This is achieved without excessive fine-tuning in
the parameters important for neutrino mass.
