simulations. In particular, it breaks the gauge symmetry of stored quantum
states. We examine this effect for abelian and nonabelian theories and
demonstrate that optimizing the digitization of gauge theories to quantum
memory to account for noise channels can extend the lifetime before complete
loss of gauge symmetry by $2-10\times$ over some other digitizations. These
constructions also allow for quantum error correction to integrate the
symmetries of quantum fields and prioritize the largest gauge violations.","hep-lat quant-ph"

gauge theory, which discusses the quantum gauge freedom. In gaugeon formalism,
theory admits quantum gauge symmetry which leaves the action form-invariant.
The BRST symmetric gaugeon formalism is also studied which introduces the
gaugeon ghost fields and gaugeon ghosts of ghosts fields. To replace the
Yokoyama subsidiary conditions by a single Kugo-Ojima type condition the virtue
of BRST symmetry is utilized. Under generalized BRST transformations, we show
that the gaugeon fields appear naturally in the reducible gauge theory.","physics.gen-ph hep-th"

""Chern-Weil global symmetries,"" that arise ubiquitously in gauge theories. The
Noether currents of these Chern-Weil global symmetries are given by wedge
products of gauge field strengths, such as $F_2 \wedge H_3$ and
$\text{tr}(F_2^2)$, and their conservation follows from Bianchi identities. As
a result, they are not easy to break. However, it is widely believed that exact
global symmetries are not allowed in a consistent theory of quantum gravity. As
a result, any Chern-Weil global symmetry in a low-energy effective field theory
must be either broken or gauged when the theory is coupled to gravity. In this
paper, we explore the processes by which Chern-Weil symmetries may be broken or
gauged in effective field theory and string theory. We will see that many
familiar phenomena in string theory, such as axions, Chern-Simons terms,
worldvolume degrees of freedom, and branes ending on or dissolving in other
branes, can be interpreted as consequences of the absence of Chern-Weil
symmetries in quantum gravity, suggesting that they might be general features
of quantum gravity. We further discuss implications of breaking and gauging
Chern-Weil symmetries for particle phenomenology and for boundary CFTs of AdS
bulk theories. Chern-Weil global symmetries thus offer a unified framework for
understanding many familiar aspects of quantum field theory and quantum
gravity.","hep-th hep-ph"

that the classical massive Yang-Mills theory and the pure Yang-Mills theory
whose gauge symmetry is broken by a gauge fixing term are identical from the
view point of quantum gauge symmetry. The explicit infinitesimal
transformations which leave the massive Yang-Mills theory BRST invariant are
given.","hep-th quant-ph"
"quantum_field","quantum field theory gauge symmetry","4","22.473652","2208.05973","Universal Non-Invertible Symmetries","It is well-known that gauging a finite 0-form symmetry in a quantum field
theory leads to a dual symmetry generated by topological Wilson line defects.
These are described by the representations of the 0-form symmetry group which
form a 1-category. We argue that for a d-dimensional quantum field theory the
full set of dual symmetries one obtains is in fact much larger and is described
by a (d-1)-category, which is formed out of lower-dimensional topological
quantum field theories with the same 0-form symmetry. We study in detail a
2-categorical piece of this (d-1)-category described by 2d topological quantum
field theories with 0-form symmetry. We further show that the objects of this
2-category are the recently discussed 2d condensation defects constructed from
higher-gauging of Wilson lines. Similarly, dual symmetries obtained by gauging
any higher-form or higher-group symmetry also form a (d-1)-category formed out
of lower-dimensional topological quantum field theories with that higher-form
or higher-group symmetry. A particularly interesting case is that of the
2-category of dual symmetries associated to gauging of finite 2-group
symmetries, as it describes non-invertible symmetries arising from gauging
0-form symmetries that act on (d-3)-form symmetries. Such non-invertible
symmetries were studied recently in the literature via other methods, and our
results not only agree with previous results, but our approach also provides a
much simpler way of computing various properties of these non-invertible
symmetries. We describe how our results can be applied to compute
non-invertible symmetries of various classes of gauge theories with continuous
disconnected gauge groups in various spacetime dimensions. We also discuss the
2-category formed by 2d condensation defects in any arbitrary quantum field
theory.","hep-th cond-mat.str-el math.CT"
"quantum_field","quantum field theory gauge symmetry","9","21.879555","1107.4664","Gauge symmetry breaking in gauge theories---In search of clarification","The paper investigates the spontaneous breaking of gauge symmetries in gauge
theories from a philosophical angle, taking into account the fact that the
notion of a spontaneously broken local gauge symmetry, though widely employed
in textbook expositions of the Higgs mechanism, is not supported by our leading
theoretical frameworks of gauge quantum theories. In the context of lattice
gauge theory, the statement that local gauge symmetry cannot be spontaneously
broken can even be made rigorous in the form of Elitzur's theorem.
Nevertheless, gauge symmetry breaking does occur in gauge quantum field
theories in the form of the breaking of remnant subgroups of the original local
gauge group under which the theories typically remain invariant after gauge
fixing. The paper discusses the relation between these instances of symmetry
breaking and phase transitions and draws some more general conclusions for the
philosophical interpretation of gauge symmetries and their breaking.","physics.hist-ph"

for light degrees of freedom after the decoupling of heavy modes. This
redundant description avoids the use of explicit constraints in configuration
space. For non-linear constraints the gauge symmetries are non-linear. In a
quantum field theory setting the gauge symmetries are local and can describe
Yang-Mills theories or quantum gravity. We formulate gauge invariant fields
that correspond to the non-linear light degrees of freedom. In the context of
functional renormalization gauge symmetries can emerge if the flow generates or
preserves large mass-like terms for the heavy degrees of freedom. They
correspond to a particular form of gauge fixing terms in quantum field
theories.","hep-th cond-mat.stat-mech gr-qc"

to formulate classical and quantum theories of a particle coupled to an Abelian
gauge field. It is shown that the symmetry (a) requires the field to have
dynamic degrees of freedom and to be a connection in a non-flat space-time
manifold, and (b) leads to a quantum theory free of the measurement problem. It
is speculated that gravitomagnetism could be a possible source of the gauge
field.","quant-ph gr-qc"

dimensions, a dual $\mathbb{Z}_n$ symmetry appears, such that re-gauging this
dual $\mathbb{Z}_n$ symmetry leads back to the original theory. We describe how
this can be generalized to non-Abelian groups, by enlarging the concept of
symmetries from those defined by groups to those defined by unitary fusion
categories. We will see that this generalization is also useful when studying
what happens when a non-anomalous subgroup of an anomalous finite group is
gauged: for example, the gauged theory can have non-Abelian group symmetry even
when the original symmetry is an Abelian group. We then discuss the
axiomatization of two-dimensional topological quantum field theories whose
symmetry is given by a category. We see explicitly that the gauged version is a
topological quantum field theory with a new symmetry given by a dual category.","hep-th math.CT"
