Building on our previous studies, which establish Navier-Stokes-based approaches to spatial treatment effects and financial network fragility, we demonstrate that technology adoption spreads simultaneously through both geographic proximity and supply chain connections. Using comprehensive data on six technologies adopted by 500 firms over 2010-2023, we document three key findings. First, technology adoption exhibits strong exponential geographic decay with spatial decay rate $\kappa \approx 0.043$ per kilometer, implying a spatial boundary of $d^* \approx 69$ kilometers beyond which spillovers are negligible (R-squared = 0.99). Second, supply chain connections create technology-specific networks whose algebraic connectivity ($\lambda_2$) increases 300-380 percent as adoption spreads, with correlation between $\lambda_2$ and adoption exceeding 0.95 across all technologies. Third, traditional difference-in-differences methods that ignore spatial and network structure exhibit 61 percent bias in estimated treatment effects. An event study around COVID-19 reveals that network fragility increased 24.5 percent post-shock, amplifying treatment effects through supply chain spillovers in a manner analogous to financial contagion documented in our recent study. Our framework provides micro-foundations for technology policy: interventions have spatial reach of 69 kilometers and network amplification factor of 10.8, requiring coordinated geographic and supply chain targeting for optimal effectiveness.",econ.EM econ.TH stat.AP stat.ME

geographical extensions of social influence modelling. Improved understanding
of innovation diffusion across locations and through social connections can
provide us with new insights into the spread of information, technological
progress and economic development. In this work, we analyze the spatial
adoption dynamics of iWiW, an Online Social Network (OSN) in Hungary and
uncover empirical features about the spatial adoption in social networks.
During its entire life cycle from 2002 to 2012, iWiW reached up to 300 million
friendship ties of 3 million users. We find that the number of adopters as a
function of town population follows a scaling law that reveals a strongly
concentrated early adoption in large towns and a less concentrated late
adoption. We also discover a strengthening distance decay of spread over the
life-cycle indicating high fraction of distant diffusion in early stages but
the dominance of local diffusion in late stages. The spreading process is
modelled within the Bass diffusion framework that enables us to compare the
differential equation version with an agent-based version of the model run on
the empirical network. Although both models can capture the macro trend of
adoption, they have limited capacity to describe the observed trends of urban
scaling and distance decay. We find, however that incorporating adoption
thresholds, defined by the fraction of social connections that adopt a
technology before the individual adopts, improves the network model fit to the
urban scaling of early adopters. Controlling for the threshold distribution
enables us to eliminate the bias induced by local network structure on
predicting local adoption peaks. Finally, we show that geographical features
such as distance from the innovation origin and town size influence prediction
of adoption peak at local scales.

contagion processes on social networks. We consider asymmetric individual
interactions in social networks and introduce a persuasion mechanism into the
threshold model. Specifically, we study a combination of adoption and
persuasion in cascading processes on complex networks. It is found that with
the introduction of the persuasion mechanism, the system may become more
vulnerable to global cascades, and the effects of persuasion tend to be more
significant in heterogeneous networks than those in homogeneous networks: a
comparison between heterogeneous and homogeneous networks shows that under weak
persuasion, heterogeneous networks tend to be more robust against random shocks
than homogeneous networks; whereas under strong persuasion, homogeneous
networks are more stable. Finally, we study the effects of adoption and
persuasion threshold heterogeneity on systemic stability. Though both
heterogeneities give rise to global cascades, the adoption heterogeneity has an
overwhelmingly stronger impact than the persuasion heterogeneity when the
network connectivity is sufficiently dense.

  temporal networks","  A person's decision to adopt an idea or product is often driven by the
decisions of peers, mediated through a network of social ties. A common way of
modeling adoption dynamics is to use threshold models, where a node may become
an adopter given a high enough rate of contacts with adopted neighbors. We
study the dynamics of threshold models that take both the network topology and
the timings of contacts into account, using empirical contact sequences as
substrates. The models are designed such that adoption is driven by the number
of contacts with different adopted neighbors within a chosen time. We find that
while some networks support cascades leading to network-level adoption, some do
not: the propagation of adoption depends on several factors from the frequency
of contacts to burstiness and timing correlations of contact sequences. More
specifically, burstiness is seen to suppress cascades sizes when compared to
randomised contact timings, while timing correlations between contacts on
adjacent links facilitate cascades.

firms who have budgets to ""seed"" the initial adoption of their products by
consumers located in a social network. The payoffs to the firms are the
eventual number of adoptions of their product through a competitive stochastic
diffusion process in the network. This framework yields a rich class of
competitive strategies, which depend in subtle ways on the stochastic dynamics
of adoption, the relative budgets of the players, and the underlying structure
of the social network.
  We identify a general property of the adoption dynamics --- namely,
decreasing returns to local adoption --- for which the inefficiency of resource
use at equilibrium (the Price of Anarchy) is uniformly bounded above, across
all networks. We also show that if this property is violated the Price of
Anarchy can be unbounded, thus yielding sharp threshold behavior for a broad
class of dynamics.
  We also introduce a new notion, the Budget Multiplier, that measures the
extent that imbalances in player budgets can be amplified at equilibrium. We
again identify a general property of the adoption dynamics --- namely,
proportional local adoption between competitors --- for which the (pure
strategy) Budget Multiplier is uniformly bounded above, across all networks. We
show that a violation of this property can lead to unbounded Budget Multiplier,
again yielding sharp threshold behavior for a broad class of dynamics.

Our central research question addresses the role of executive characteristics in technology adoption, finding that CEO age and technical background significantly predict AI investment propensity. Employing these demographic characteristics as instrumental variables to address endogeneity concerns, we identify a statistically significant 2.4% increase in total factor productivity attributable to AI investment adoption. Our novel mechanism decomposition framework reveals that productivity gains operate through three distinct channels: cost reduction (40% of total effect), revenue enhancement (35%), and innovation acceleration (25%). The results demonstrate that younger executives (below 50 years) are 23% more likely to adopt AI technologies, while firm size significantly moderates this relationship. Aggregate projections suggest potential GDP impacts of 1.15 trillion JPY from widespread AI adoption across the Japanese economy.

  exogenous effects, and unconcerned behaviour govern online adoption spreading","  Adoption of innovations, products or online services is commonly interpreted
as a spreading process driven to large extent by social influence and
conditioned by the needs and capacities of individuals. To model this process
one usually introduces behavioural threshold mechanisms, which can give rise to
the evolution of global cascades if the system satisfies a set of conditions.
However, these models do not address temporal aspects of the emerging cascades,
which in real systems may evolve through various pathways ranging from slow to
rapid patterns. Here we fill this gap through the analysis and modelling of
product adoption in the world's largest voice over internet service, the social
network of Skype. We provide empirical evidence about the heterogeneous
distribution of fractional behavioural thresholds, which appears to be
independent of the degree of adopting egos. We show that the structure of
real-world adoption clusters is radically different from previous theoretical
expectations, since vulnerable adoptions --induced by a single adopting
neighbour-- appear to be important only locally, while spontaneous adopters
arriving at a constant rate and the involvement of unconcerned individuals
govern the global emergence of social spreading.

the social interactions of individuals in a population. The Bass diffusion
model has been widely used to model the temporal evolution of adoption in such
social systems. In the model, the likelihood of a new adoption is proportional
to the number of previous adopters, implicitly assuming a global (or
homogeneous) interaction among all individuals in the network. Such global
interactions do not exist in many large social networks, however. Instead,
individuals typically interact with a small part of the larger population. To
quantify the growth rate (or equivalently the adoption timing) in networks with
limited interactions, we study a stochastic adoption process where the
likelihood that each individual adopts is proportional to the number of
adopters among the small group of persons he/she interacts with (and not the
entire population of adopters). When the underlying network of interactions is
a random $k$-regular graph, we compute the sample path limit of the fraction of
adopters. We show the limit coincides with the solution of a differential
equation which can viewed as a generalization of the Bass diffusion model. When
the degree $k$ is bounded, we show the adoption curve differs significantly
from the one corresponds to the Bass diffusion model. In particular, the
adoption grows more slowly than what the Bass model projects. In addition, the
adoption curve is asymmetric, unlike that of the Bass diffusion model. Such
asymmetry has important consequences for the estimation of market potential.
Finally, we calculate the timing of early adoptions at finer scales, e.g.,
logarithmic in the population size.

certain social behavior requires verification of its credibility and

reinforcement, which so far has eluded theoretical analysis. We first propose a
general social contagion model with reinforcement derived from non-redundant
information memory. Then, we develop a unified edge-based compartmental theory
to analyze this model, and a remarkable agreement with numerics is obtained on
some specific models. Using a spreading threshold model as a specific example
to understand the memory effect, in which each individual adopts a social
behavior only when the cumulative pieces of information that the individual
received from his/her neighbors exceeds an adoption threshold. Through analysis
and numerical simulations, we find that the memory characteristic markedly
affects the dynamics as quantified by the final adoption size. Strikingly, we
uncover a transition phenomenon in which the dependence of the final adoption
size on some key parameters, such as the transmission probability, can change
from being discontinuous to being continuous. The transition can be triggered
by proper parameters and structural perturbations to the system, such as
decreasing individuals' adoption threshold, increasing initial seed size, or
enhancing the network heterogeneity.

integrating discrete choice and technology adoption models to address the
aforementioned issue. In order to do so, we build on the formulation of
discrete mixture models and specifically Latent Class Choice Models (LCCMs),
which were integrated with a network effect model. The network effect model
quantifies the impact of the spatial/network effect of the new technology on
the utility of adoption. We adopted a confirmatory approach to estimating our
dynamic LCCM based on findings from the technology diffusion literature that
focus on defining two distinct types of adopters: innovator/early adopters and
imitators. LCCMs allow for heterogeneity in the utility of adoption for the
various market segments i.e. innovators/early adopters, imitators and
non-adopters. We make use of revealed preference (RP) time series data from a
one-way carsharing system in a major city in the United States to estimate
model parameters. The data entails a complete set of member enrollment for the
carsharing service for a time period of 2.5 years after being launched.
Consistent with the technology diffusion literature, our model identifies three
latent classes whose utility of adoption have a well-defined set of preferences
that are significant and behaviorally consistent. The technology adoption model
predicts the probability that a certain individual will adopt the service at a
certain time period, and is explained by social influences, network effect,
socio-demographics and level-of-service attributes. Finally, the model was
calibrated and then used to forecast adoption of the carsharing system for
potential investment strategy scenarios.

Existing research predominantly focuses on static factor analyses, failing to adequately capture the dynamic evolutionary mechanisms of farmer strategic interactions and the impacts of information asymmetries in agricultural markets. This study constructs an evolutionary game model integrating heterogeneous time preferences and lemon market effects to reveal the dynamic equilibrium of technology adoption within farmer groups operating under bounded rationality. Key findings indicate that farmers with high time preferences significantly impede CTT adoption due to the excessive discounting of long-term benefits. Furthermore, the lemon market effect dictates the system's equilibrium states: 1) When the lemon market benefit ($P$) exceeds the lemon market loss ($Q$) ($P > Q$), stable tripartite coexistence of adoption strategies emerges; 2) When $P < Q$, the system evolves unpredictably, exhibiting dynamics characterized by heteroclinic cycles; 3) At the critical threshold $P = Q$, the system transforms into a conservative Hamiltonian system, yielding stable periodic oscillation solutions. Based on these insights, policy recommendations are proposed: implementing ecological certification schemes to mitigate information asymmetry, offering subsidies and insurance to reduce adoption risks, and utilizing environmental taxes to internalize the negative externalities associated with conventional tillage.

However, the role of macro-level social influence -- where widespread adoption enhances further adoption -- remains understudied. Here, we focus on a contagion process that incorporates both pairwise interactions and macro-level reinforcement. We show that the contagion undergoes a shift from continuous to mixed-order transition as macro-level influence exceeds a reinforcement threshold. Simulations on various real-world networks indicate that network localization governs the contagion outcomes by determining the critical point and the reinforcement threshold. Building on this insight, we develop a structural metric linking network localization to contagion dynamics, revealing a key trade-off: networks that facilitate weak contagion tend to experience slower diffusion and lower adoption rates, while networks that suppress weak contagions enable faster and more widespread adoption.

social entity will adopt a product, service, or opinion in the foreseeable
future. Such probabilities are central to fundamental issues in social network
analysis, including the influence maximization problem. In practice, adoption
probabilities have significant implications for applications ranging from
social network-based target marketing to political campaigns; yet, predicting
adoption probabilities has not received sufficient research attention. Building
on relevant social network theories, we identify and operationalize key factors
that affect adoption decisions: social influence, structural equivalence,
entity similarity, and confounding factors. We then develop the
locally-weighted expectation-maximization method for Na\""ive Bayesian learning
to predict adoption probabilities on the basis of these factors. The principal
challenge addressed in this study is how to predict adoption probabilities in
the presence of confounding factors that are generally unobserved. Using data
from two large-scale social networks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method. The empirical results also suggest that cascade methods
primarily using social influence to predict adoption probabilities offer
limited predictive power, and that confounding factors are critical to adoption
probability predictions.

so-called complex threshold dynamics and a simple
Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model. Separately, these mechanisms
lead, respectively, to first order and continuous transitions between
non-adoption and adoption phases. We consider two interconnected layers. While
all nodes on the first layer follow the complex adoption process, all nodes on
the second layer follow the simple adoption process. Coupling between the two
adoption processes occurs as a result of the inclusion of some additional
interconnections between layers. We find that the transition points and also
the nature of the transitions are modified in the coupled dynamics. In the
complex adoption layer, the critical threshold required for extension of
adoption increases with interlayer connectivity whereas in the case of an
isolated single network it would decrease with average connectivity. In
addition, the transition can become continuous depending on the detailed inter
and intralayer connectivities. In the SIS layer, any interlayer connectivity
leads to the extension of the adopter phase. Besides, a new transition appears
as as sudden drop of the fraction of adopters in the SIS layer. The main
numerical findings are described by a mean-field type analytical approach
appropriately developed for the threshold-SIS coupled system.

behaviors are adopted in a population. These models typically lead to a
continuous or a discontinuous phase transition of the number of adopters as a
function of a control parameter. We explore a simple model of social adoption
where the agents can be in two states, either adopters or non-adopters, and can
switch between these two states interacting with other agents through a
network. The probability of an agent to switch from non-adopter to adopter
depends on the number of adopters in her network neighborhood, the adoption
threshold $T$ and the adoption coefficient $a$, two parameters defining a Hill
function. In contrast, the transition from adopter to non-adopter is
spontaneous at a certain rate $\mu$. In a mean-field approach, we derive the
governing ordinary differential equations and show that the nature of the
transition between the global non-adoption and global adoption regimes depends
mostly on the balance between the probability to adopt with one and two
adopters. The transition changes from continuous, via a transcritical
bifurcation, to discontinuous, via a combination of a saddle-node and a
transcritical bifurcation, through a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation. We
characterize the full parameter space. Finally, we compare our analytical
results with Montecarlo simulations on annealed and quenched degree regular
networks, showing a better agreement for the annealed case. Our results show
how a simple model is able to capture two seemingly very different types of
transitions, i.e., continuous and discontinuous and thus unifies underlying
dynamics for different systems. Furthermore the form of the adoption
probability used here is based on empirical measurements.

  Security Innovations","  Information System (IS) Security threats is still a major concern for many
organisations. However, most organisations fall short in achieving a successful
adoption and implementation of IS security measures. In this paper, we
developed a theoretical model for the adoption process of IS Security
innovations in organisations. The model was derived by combining four
theoretical models of innovation adoption, namely: Diffusion of Innovation
theory (DOI), the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the Theory of Planned
Behaviour (TPB) and the Technology-Organisation-Environment (TOE) framework.
The model depicts IS security innovation adoption in organisations, as two
decision proceedings. The adoption process from the initiation stage until the
acquisition of innovation is considered as a decision made by organisation
while the process of innovation assimilation is assumed as a result of the user
acceptance of innovation within the organisation. In addition, the model
describes the IS Security adoption process progressing in three sequential
stages, i.e. pre-adoption, adoption- decision and post-adoption phases. The
model also introduces several factors that influence the different stages of IS
Security innovation adoption process. This study contributes to IS security
literature by proposing an overall model of IS security adoption that includes
organisational adoption and user acceptance of innovation in a single
illustration. Also, IS security adoption model proposed in this study provides
important practical implications for research and practice.

It establishes five results: (i) positive interactions guarantee nonnegative amplification, (ii) perceived utility saturates after $\approx\!3$ complementary additions (Weber--Fechner), (iii) frequency of comparable introductions dominates incremental quality improvements, (iv) reinforcing interactions yields monotone gains while decay control gives ambiguous effects, and (v) long-run retention under SIS-type dynamics is bounded by the inverse spectral radius of the adoption graph.

Adoption rates vary significantly across regions and sectors: some states are emerging as early adopters, while others lag, and knowledge-intensive industries (such as information technology and professional services) along with larger firms show higher openness to AI adoption compared to sectors like construction or small businesses.

but the impacts of opinion leaders on social behavior contagions are still not
fully understood, especially by using a mathematical model. Here we generalize
the classical Watts threshold model and address the influences of the opinion
leaders, where an individual adopts a new behavior if one of his/her opinion
leaders adopts the behavior. First, we choose the opinion leaders randomly from
all individuals in the network and find the impacts of opinion leaders make
other individuals adopt the behavior more easily. Specifically, the existence
of opinion leaders reduces the lowest mean degree of the network required for
the global behavior adoption, and increases the highest mean degree of the
network that the global behavior adoption can occur. Besides, the introduction
of opinion leaders accelerates the behavior adoption, but does not change the
adoption order of individuals. The developed theoretical predictions agree with
the simulation results. Second, we randomly choose the opinion leaders from the
top h% of the highest degree individuals, and find an optimal h% for the
network with the lowest mean degree that the global behavior adoption can
occur. Meanwhile, the influences of opinion leaders on accelerating the
adoption of behaviors become less significant and can even be ignored when
reducing the value of h%.
