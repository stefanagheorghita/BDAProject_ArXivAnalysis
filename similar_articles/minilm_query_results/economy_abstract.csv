social networks and cascades of default in financial networks. In some cases,
these networks may have multiple kinds of interactions, such as distinct types
of social ties or distinct types of financial liabilities; furthermore, nodes
may respond in different ways to in influence from their neighbors of multiple
types. To start to capture such settings in a stylized way, we generalize a
threshold cascade model to a multiplex network in which nodes follow one of two
response rules: some nodes activate when, in at least one layer, a large enough
fraction of neighbors are active, while the other nodes activate when, in all
layers, a large enough fraction of neighbors are active. Varying the fractions
of nodes following either rule facilitates or inhibits cascades. Near the
inhibition regime, global cascades appear discontinuously as the network
density increases; however, the cascade grows more slowly over time. This
behavior suggests a way in which various collective phenomena in the real world
could appear abruptly yet slowly.

  localization in regulating innovation diffusion","  The macro social influence is recognized as a non-negligible ingredient in
innovation propagation: more adopters in the network lead to a higher adoption
tendency for the rest individuals. A recent study to incorporate such a crucial
mechanism shows that sufficient intensity of macro-level social influence can
cause a change from a continuous to discontinuous transition, further
indicating the existence of a tricritical point. Although network localization
strength determines the tricritical point, it remains unclear what network
quantities govern the performance of localization in regulating innovation
diffusion. To address this issue, we herein consider the model incorporating
both the micro- and macro-levels social influence. We present a dynamic
message-passing method to analytically treat both the outbreak threshold and
recovered population, and validate the predictions through agent-based
simulations. Extensive analysis on the classical synthetic networks shows that
sparsely available connections, and relatively heterogeneous degree
distribution, either assortative or extremely disassortative configurations are
favorable for continuous transition. In such cases, the employed network can
yield a strong localization effect so that the innovation is trapped in the
configurations composed of the hubs with high non-backtracking centrality. We
further explore the dependence of both tricritical point and localization
strength on three structural quantities: network density, heterogeneity, and
assortativity, which gives a clear physical picture of the joint effects of the
three structure quantities on the localization strength. Finally, we conclude
that the core-periphery structure, being sensitive to the change of the three
structure quantities, essentially determines localization strength, and further
regulates the phase transition.

geographical extensions of social influence modelling. Improved understanding
of innovation diffusion across locations and through social connections can
provide us with new insights into the spread of information, technological
progress and economic development. In this work, we analyze the spatial
adoption dynamics of iWiW, an Online Social Network (OSN) in Hungary and
uncover empirical features about the spatial adoption in social networks.
During its entire life cycle from 2002 to 2012, iWiW reached up to 300 million
friendship ties of 3 million users. We find that the number of adopters as a
function of town population follows a scaling law that reveals a strongly
concentrated early adoption in large towns and a less concentrated late
adoption. We also discover a strengthening distance decay of spread over the
life-cycle indicating high fraction of distant diffusion in early stages but
the dominance of local diffusion in late stages. The spreading process is
modelled within the Bass diffusion framework that enables us to compare the
differential equation version with an agent-based version of the model run on
the empirical network. Although both models can capture the macro trend of
adoption, they have limited capacity to describe the observed trends of urban
scaling and distance decay. We find, however that incorporating adoption
thresholds, defined by the fraction of social connections that adopt a
technology before the individual adopts, improves the network model fit to the
urban scaling of early adopters. Controlling for the threshold distribution
enables us to eliminate the bias induced by local network structure on
predicting local adoption peaks. Finally, we show that geographical features
such as distance from the innovation origin and town size influence prediction
of adoption peak at local scales.

combination of illiquid investments and random withdrawals by depositors. But
it also creates the potential for one bank's failure to trigger off avalanches
of further failures. We simulate a model of interbank lending to study the
interplay of these two effects. We show that when banks are similar in size and
exposure to risk, avalanche effects are small so that widening the interbank
market leads to more stability. But as heterogeneity increases, avalanche
effects become more important. By varying the heterogeneity and connectivity
across banks, the system enters a critical regime with a power law distribution
of avalanche sizes.

We extend the Navier-Stokes-based approach from our previous studies to characterize contagion dynamics in the European banking system through the spectral properties of network evolution operators. Using high-quality bilateral exposure data from the European Banking Authority Transparency Exercise (2014-2023), we estimate the causal impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on network fragility using spatial difference-in-differences methods adapted from our previous studies. Our empirical analysis reveals that COVID-19 elevated network fragility, measured by the algebraic connectivity $\lambda_2$ of the system Laplacian, by 26.9% above pre-pandemic levels (95% CI: [7.4%, 46.5%], p<0.05), with effects persisting through 2023. Paradoxically, this occurred despite a 46% reduction in the number of banks, demonstrating that consolidation increased systemic vulnerability by intensifying interconnectedness-consistent with theoretical predictions from continuous spatial dynamics. Our findings validate the key predictions from \citet{kikuchi2024dynamical}: treatment effects amplify over time through spatial spillovers, consolidation increases fragility when coupling strength rises, and systems exhibit structural hysteresis preventing automatic reversion to pre-shock equilibria. The results demonstrate the empirical relevance of continuous functional methods for financial stability analysis and provide new insights for macroprudential policy design. We propose network-based capital requirements targeting spectral centrality and stress testing frameworks incorporating diffusion dynamics to address the coupling externalities identified in our analysis."

  diffusion and emerging macro-level adoption patterns","  A micro-level agent-based model of innovation diffusion was developed that
explicitly combines (a) an individual's perception of the advantages or
relative utility derived from adoption, and (b) social influence from members
of the individual's social network. The micro-model was used to simulate
macro-level diffusion patterns emerging from different configurations of
micro-model parameters. Micro-level simulation results matched very closely the
adoption patterns predicted by the widely-used Bass macro-level model (Bass,
1969). For a portion of the domain, results from micro-simulations were
consistent with aggregate-level adoption patterns reported in the literature.
Induced Bass macro-level parameters and responded to changes in
micro-parameters: (1) increased with the number of innovators and with the rate
at which innovators are introduced; (2) increased with the probability of
rewiring in small-world networks, as the characteristic path length decreases;
and (3) an increase in the overall perceived utility of an innovation caused a
corresponding increase in induced and values. Understanding micro to macro
linkages can inform the design and assessment of marketing interventions on
micro-variables - or processes related to them - to enhance adoption of future
products or technologies.

  temporal networks","  A person's decision to adopt an idea or product is often driven by the
decisions of peers, mediated through a network of social ties. A common way of
modeling adoption dynamics is to use threshold models, where a node may become
an adopter given a high enough rate of contacts with adopted neighbors. We
study the dynamics of threshold models that take both the network topology and
the timings of contacts into account, using empirical contact sequences as
substrates. The models are designed such that adoption is driven by the number
of contacts with different adopted neighbors within a chosen time. We find that
while some networks support cascades leading to network-level adoption, some do
not: the propagation of adoption depends on several factors from the frequency
of contacts to burstiness and timing correlations of contact sequences. More
specifically, burstiness is seen to suppress cascades sizes when compared to
randomised contact timings, while timing correlations between contacts on
adjacent links facilitate cascades.

social and economic networks are often driven by cascading mechanisms, and so
are contagion dynamics in financial networks. Global behaviors generally emerge
from the interplay between the structure of the interconnection topology and
the local agents' interactions. We focus on the Linear Threshold Model (LTM) of
cascades first introduced by Granovetter (1978). This can be interpreted as the
best response dynamics in a network game whereby agents choose strategically
between two actions and their payoff is an increasing function of the number of
their neighbors choosing the same action. Each agent is equipped with an
individual threshold representing the number of her neighbors who must have
adopted a certain action for that to become the agent's best response. We
analyze the LTM dynamics on large-scale networks with heterogeneous agents.
Through a local mean-field approach, we obtain a nonlinear, one-dimensional,
recursive equation that approximates the evolution of the LTM dynamics on most
of the networks of a given size and distribution of degrees and thresholds.
Specifically, we prove that, on all but a fraction of networks with given
degree and threshold statistics that is vanishing as the network size grows
large, the actual fraction of adopters of a given action in the LTM dynamics is
arbitrarily close to the output of the aforementioned recursion. We then
analyze the dynamic behavior of this recursion and its bifurcations from a
dynamical systems viewpoint. Applications of our findings to some real network
testbeds show good adherence of the theoretical predictions to numerical
simulations.

in order to study the diffusion times of innovation or information in networks
with a scale-free structure, typical of regions where diffusion is sensitive to
geographic and logistic influences (like for instance Alpine regions). We
consider both the diffusion peak times of the total population and of the link
classes. In the familiar trickle-down processes the adoption curve of the hubs
is found to anticipate the total adoption in a predictable way. In a major
departure from the standard model, we model a trickle-up process by introducing
heterogeneous publicity coefficients (which can also be negative for the hubs,
thus turning them into stiflers) and a stochastic term which represents the
erratic generation of innovation at the periphery of the network. The results
confirm the robustness of the Bass model and expand considerably its range of
applicability.

the social interactions of individuals in a population. The Bass diffusion
model has been widely used to model the temporal evolution of adoption in such
social systems. In the model, the likelihood of a new adoption is proportional
to the number of previous adopters, implicitly assuming a global (or
homogeneous) interaction among all individuals in the network. Such global
interactions do not exist in many large social networks, however. Instead,
individuals typically interact with a small part of the larger population. To
quantify the growth rate (or equivalently the adoption timing) in networks with
limited interactions, we study a stochastic adoption process where the
likelihood that each individual adopts is proportional to the number of
adopters among the small group of persons he/she interacts with (and not the
entire population of adopters). When the underlying network of interactions is
a random $k$-regular graph, we compute the sample path limit of the fraction of
adopters. We show the limit coincides with the solution of a differential
equation which can viewed as a generalization of the Bass diffusion model. When
the degree $k$ is bounded, we show the adoption curve differs significantly
from the one corresponds to the Bass diffusion model. In particular, the
adoption grows more slowly than what the Bass model projects. In addition, the
adoption curve is asymmetric, unlike that of the Bass diffusion model. Such
asymmetry has important consequences for the estimation of market potential.
Finally, we calculate the timing of early adoptions at finer scales, e.g.,
logarithmic in the population size.

  Crossover phenomena in phase transition","  Heterogeneous adoption thresholds exist widely in social contagions, but were
always neglected in previous studies. We first propose a non-Markovian
spreading threshold model with general adoption threshold distribution. In
order to understand the effects of heterogeneous adoption thresholds
quantitatively, an edge-based compartmental theory is developed for the
proposed model. We use a binary spreading threshold model as a specific
example, in which some individuals have a low adoption threshold (i.e.,
activists) while the remaining ones hold a relatively high adoption threshold
(i.e., bigots), to demonstrate that heterogeneous adoption thresholds markedly
affect the final adoption size and phase transition. Interestingly, the
first-order, second-order and hybrid phase transitions can be found in the
system. More importantly, there are two different kinds of crossover phenomena
in phase transition for distinct values of bigots' adoption threshold: a change
from first-order or hybrid phase transition to the second-order phase
transition. The theoretical predictions based on the suggested theory agree
very well with the results of numerical simulations.

We model financial distress propagation as a diffusion process on weighted networks, deriving a network diffusion equation from first principles that predicts contagion decay depends on the network's algebraic connectivity through the relation $\kappa = \sqrt{\lambda_2/D}$, where $\lambda_2$ is the second-smallest eigenvalue of the graph Laplacian and $D$ is the diffusion coefficient. Applying this framework to European banking data from the EBA stress tests (2018, 2021, 2023), we estimate interbank exposure networks using maximum entropy methods and track the evolution of systemic risk through the COVID-19 crisis. Our key finding is that network connectivity declined by 45\% from 2018 to 2023, implying a 26\% reduction in the contagion decay parameter. Difference-in-differences analysis reveals this structural change was driven by regulatory-induced deleveraging of systemically important banks, which experienced differential asset reductions of 17\% relative to smaller institutions. The networks exhibit lognormal rather than scale-free degree distributions, suggesting greater resilience than previously assumed in the literature. Extensive robustness checks across parametric and non-parametric estimation methods confirm declining systemic risk, with cross-method correlations exceeding 0.95. These findings demonstrate that post-COVID-19 regulatory reforms effectively reduced network interconnectedness and systemic vulnerability in the European banking system."

  exogenous effects, and unconcerned behaviour govern online adoption spreading","  Adoption of innovations, products or online services is commonly interpreted
as a spreading process driven to large extent by social influence and
conditioned by the needs and capacities of individuals. To model this process
one usually introduces behavioural threshold mechanisms, which can give rise to
the evolution of global cascades if the system satisfies a set of conditions.
However, these models do not address temporal aspects of the emerging cascades,
which in real systems may evolve through various pathways ranging from slow to
rapid patterns. Here we fill this gap through the analysis and modelling of
product adoption in the world's largest voice over internet service, the social
network of Skype. We provide empirical evidence about the heterogeneous
distribution of fractional behavioural thresholds, which appears to be
independent of the degree of adopting egos. We show that the structure of
real-world adoption clusters is radically different from previous theoretical
expectations, since vulnerable adoptions --induced by a single adopting
neighbour-- appear to be important only locally, while spontaneous adopters
arriving at a constant rate and the involvement of unconcerned individuals
govern the global emergence of social spreading.

differential equations coupled by their drift. We assume a core-periphery
structure, and that the banks in the core hold a bubbly asset. The banks in the
periphery have not direct access to the bubble, but can take initially
advantage from its increase by investing on the banks in the core. Investments
are modeled by the weight of the links, which is a function of the robustness
of the banks. In this way, a preferential attachment mechanism towards the core
takes place during the growth of the bubble. We then investigate how the bubble
distort the shape of the network, both for finite and infinitely large systems,
assuming a non vanishing impact of the core on the periphery. Due to the
influence of the bubble, the banks are no longer independent, and the law of
large numbers cannot be directly applied at the limit. This results in a term
in the drift of the diffusions which does not average out, and that increases
systemic risk at the moment of the burst. We test this feature of the model by
numerical simulations.

This paper develops a unified spatial-network framework to analyze systemic risk dynamics, revealing three critical findings that challenge conventional wisdom. First, banking consolidation paradoxically increased systemic fragility: while bank numbers declined 47.3% from 2007 to 2023, network fragility measured by algebraic connectivity rose 315.8%, demonstrating that interconnectedness intensity dominates institutional count. Second, financial contagion propagates globally with negligible spatial decay (boundary d* = 47,474 km), contrasting sharply with localized technology diffusion (d* = 69 km)--a scale difference of 688 times. Third, traditional difference-in-differences methods overestimate crisis impacts by 73.2% when ignoring network structure, producing severely biased policy assessments. Using bilateral exposure data from 156 institutions across 28 countries (2007-2023) and employing spectral analysis of network Laplacian operators combined with spatial difference-in-differences identification, we document that crisis effects amplified over time rather than dissipating, increasing fragility 68.4% above pre-crisis levels with persistent effects through 2023. The consolidation paradox exhibits near-perfect correlation (R = 0.97) between coupling strength and systemic vulnerability, validating theoretical predictions from continuous spatial dynamics. Policy simulations demonstrate network-targeted capital requirements achieve 11.3x amplification effects versus uniform regulations. These findings establish that accurate systemic risk assessment and macroprudential policy design require explicit incorporation of both spatial propagation and network topology."

  seeding strategies","  The well-known Ising model used in statistical physics was adapted to a
social dynamics context to simulate the adoption of a technological innovation.
The model explicitly combines (a) an individual's perception of the advantages
of an innovation and (b) social influence from members of the decision-maker's
social network. The micro-level adoption dynamics are embedded into an
agent-based model that allows exploration of macro-level patterns of technology
diffusion throughout systems with different configurations (number and
distributions of early adopters, social network topologies). In the present
work we carry out many numerical simulations. We find that when the gap between
the individual's perception of the options is high, the adoption speed
increases if the dispersion of early adopters grows. Another test was based on
changing the network topology by means of stochastic connections to a common
opinion reference (hub), which resulted in an increment in the adoption speed.
Finally, we performed a simulation of competition between options for both
regular and small world networks.

New banks can emerge,
and existing banks can default, creating a birth-and-death setup.
Microscopically, banks evolve as independent geometric Brownian motions.
Systemic effects are captured through default contagion: as one bank defaults,
reserves of other banks are reduced by a random proportion. After examining the
long-term stability of this system, we investigate mean-field limits as the
number of banks tends to infinity. Our main results concern the measure-valued
scaling limit which is governed by a McKean-Vlasov jump-diffusion. The default
impact creates a mean-field drift, while the births and defaults introduce jump
terms tied to the current distribution of the process. Individual dynamics in
the limit is described by the propagation of chaos phenomenon. In certain
cases, we explicitly characterize the limiting average reserves.

behaviors are adopted in a population. These models typically lead to a
continuous or a discontinuous phase transition of the number of adopters as a
function of a control parameter. We explore a simple model of social adoption
where the agents can be in two states, either adopters or non-adopters, and can
switch between these two states interacting with other agents through a
network. The probability of an agent to switch from non-adopter to adopter
depends on the number of adopters in her network neighborhood, the adoption
threshold $T$ and the adoption coefficient $a$, two parameters defining a Hill
function. In contrast, the transition from adopter to non-adopter is
spontaneous at a certain rate $\mu$. In a mean-field approach, we derive the
governing ordinary differential equations and show that the nature of the
transition between the global non-adoption and global adoption regimes depends
mostly on the balance between the probability to adopt with one and two
adopters. The transition changes from continuous, via a transcritical
bifurcation, to discontinuous, via a combination of a saddle-node and a
transcritical bifurcation, through a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation. We
characterize the full parameter space. Finally, we compare our analytical
results with Montecarlo simulations on annealed and quenched degree regular
networks, showing a better agreement for the annealed case. Our results show
how a simple model is able to capture two seemingly very different types of
transitions, i.e., continuous and discontinuous and thus unifies underlying
dynamics for different systems. Furthermore the form of the adoption
probability used here is based on empirical measurements.

Building on our previous studies, which establish Navier-Stokes-based approaches to spatial treatment effects and financial network fragility, we demonstrate that technology adoption spreads simultaneously through both geographic proximity and supply chain connections. Using comprehensive data on six technologies adopted by 500 firms over 2010-2023, we document three key findings. First, technology adoption exhibits strong exponential geographic decay with spatial decay rate $\kappa \approx 0.043$ per kilometer, implying a spatial boundary of $d^* \approx 69$ kilometers beyond which spillovers are negligible (R-squared = 0.99). Second, supply chain connections create technology-specific networks whose algebraic connectivity ($\lambda_2$) increases 300-380 percent as adoption spreads, with correlation between $\lambda_2$ and adoption exceeding 0.95 across all technologies. Third, traditional difference-in-differences methods that ignore spatial and network structure exhibit 61 percent bias in estimated treatment effects. An event study around COVID-19 reveals that network fragility increased 24.5 percent post-shock, amplifying treatment effects through supply chain spillovers in a manner analogous to financial contagion documented in our recent study. Our framework provides micro-foundations for technology policy: interventions have spatial reach of 69 kilometers and network amplification factor of 10.8, requiring coordinated geographic and supply chain targeting for optimal effectiveness."
