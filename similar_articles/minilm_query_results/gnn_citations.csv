  A Bibliometric Comparison","  Applying graph-based approaches in deep learning receives more attention over
time. This study presents statistical analysis on the use of graph-based
approaches in deep learning and examines the scientific impact of the related
articles. Processing the data obtained from the Web of Science database,
metrics such as the type of the articles, funding availability, indexing type,
annual average number of citations and the number of access were analyzed to
quantitatively reveal the effects on the scientific audience. It's outlined
that deep learning-based studies gained momentum after year 2013, and the rate
of graph-based approaches in all deep learning studies increased linearly from
1% to 4% within the following 10 years. Conference publications scanned in the
Conference Proceeding Citation Index (CPCI) on the graph-based approaches
receive significantly more citations. The citation counts of the SCI-Expanded
and Emerging SCI indexed publications of the two streams are close to each
other. While the citation performances of the supported and unsupported
publications of the two sides were similar, pure deep learning studies received
more citations on the journal publication side and graph-based approaches
received more citations on the conference side. Despite their similar
performance in recent years, graph-based studies show twice more citation
performance as they get older, compared to traditional approaches. Annual
average citation performance per article for all deep learning studies is
11.051 in 2014, while it is 22.483 for graph-based studies. Also, despite
receiving 16% more access, graph-based papers get almost the same overall
citation over time with the pure counterpart. This is an indication that
graph-based approaches need a greater bunch of attention to follow, while pure
deep learning counterpart is relatively simpler to get inside.

Practitioners, novices and legal AI systems need access to these relevant data to inform appraisals and judgments. We propose a Graph-Neural-Network (GNN) link prediction model that can identify Case-Law and Case-Case citations with high proficiency through fusion of semantic and topological information. We introduce adapted relational graph convolutions operating on an extended and enriched version of the original citation graph that allow the topological integration of semantic meta-information. This further improves prediction by 3.1 points of average precision and by 8.5 points in data sparsity as well as showing robust performance over time and in challenging fully inductive prediction. Jointly learning and predicting case and norm citations achieves a large synergistic effect that improves case citation prediction by up to 4.7 points, at almost doubled efficiency."

the content of the input document, but seldom considering its citation network.
However, scientific papers are full of uncommon domain-specific terms, making
it almost impossible for the model to understand its true meaning without the
help of the relevant research community. In this paper, we redefine the task of
scientific papers summarization by utilizing their citation graph and propose a
citation graph-based summarization model CGSum which can incorporate the
information of both the source paper and its references. In addition, we
construct a novel scientific papers summarization dataset Semantic Scholar
Network (SSN) which contains 141K research papers in different domains and 661K
citation relationships. The entire dataset constitutes a large connected
citation graph. Extensive experiments show that our model can achieve
competitive performance when compared with the pretrained models even with a
simple architecture. The results also indicates the citation graph is crucial
to better understand the content of papers and generate high-quality summaries.

  Analysis in Scholarly Publication","  Citation function and citation sentiment are two essential aspects of
citation content analysis (CCA), which are useful for influence analysis, the
recommendation of scientific publications. However, existing studies are mostly
traditional machine learning methods, although deep learning techniques have

due to insufficient training data, which brings difficulties to applications.
In this paper, we propose to fine-tune pre-trained contextual embeddings
ULMFiT, BERT, and XLNet for the task. Experiments on three public datasets show
that our strategy outperforms all the baselines in terms of the F1 score. For
citation function identification, the XLNet model achieves 87.2%, 86.90%, and
81.6% on DFKI, UMICH, and TKDE2019 datasets respectively, while it achieves
91.72% and 91.56% on DFKI and UMICH in term of citation sentiment

  embeddings","  Introduction: Tracing the spread of ideas and the presence of influence is a
question of special importance across a wide range of disciplines, ranging from
intellectual history to cultural analytics, computational social science, and
the science of science.
  Method: We collect a corpus of open source journal articles, generate
Knowledge Graph representations using the Gemini LLM, and attempt to predict
the existence of citations between sampled pairs of articles using previously
published methods and a novel Graph Neural Network based embedding model.
  Results: We demonstrate that our knowledge graph embedding method is superior
at distinguishing pairs of articles with and without citation. Once trained, it
runs efficiently and can be fine-tuned on specific corpora to suit individual
researcher needs.
  Conclusion(s): This experiment demonstrates that the relationships encoded in
a knowledge graph, especially the types of concepts brought together by
specific relations can encode information capable of revealing intellectual
influence. This suggests that further work in analyzing document level
knowledge graphs to understand latent structures could provide valuable
insights.

of science field. While many studies have probed the link problem in citation
networks, only a few works have analyzed the temporal nature of link prediction
in author citation networks. In this study we compared the performance of 10
well-known local network similarity measurements to predict future links in
author citations networks. Differently from traditional link prediction
methods, the temporal nature of the predict links is relevant for our approach.
Our analysis revealed interesting results. The Jaccard coefficient was found to
be among the most relevant measurements. The preferential attachment
measurement, conversely, displayed the worst performance. We also found that
the extension of local measurements to their weighted version do not
significantly improved the performance of predicting citations. Finally, we
also found that a neural network approach summarizing the information from all

  Citation Prediction","  Accurate citation count prediction of newly published papers could help
editors and readers rapidly figure out the influential papers in the future.
Though many approaches are proposed to predict a paper's future citation, most
ignore the dynamic heterogeneous graph structure or node importance in academic
networks. To cope with this problem, we propose a Dynamic heterogeneous Graph
and Node Importance network (DGNI) learning framework, which fully leverages
the dynamic heterogeneous graph and node importance information to predict
future citation trends of newly published papers. First, a dynamic
heterogeneous network embedding module is provided to capture the dynamic
evolutionary trends of the whole academic network. Then, a node importance
embedding module is proposed to capture the global consistency relationship to
figure out each paper's node importance. Finally, the dynamic evolutionary
trend embeddings and node importance embeddings calculated above are combined
to jointly predict the future citation counts of each paper, by a log-normal
distribution model according to multi-faced paper node representations.
Extensive experiments on two large-scale datasets demonstrate that our model
significantly improves all indicators compared to the SOTA models.

network analysis called new node prediction. More technically, the task can be
categorized as zero-shot out-of-graph all-links prediction. This challenging
problem aims to predict all links from a new, isolated, and unobserved node
that was previously disconnected from the graph. Unlike classic approaches to
link prediction (including few-shot out-of-graph link prediction), this problem
presents two key differences: (1) the new node has no existing links from which
to extract patterns for new predictions; and (2) the goal is to predict not
just one, but all the links of this new node, or at least a significant part of
them. Experiments demonstrate that an architecture based on Deep Graph Neural

comparison of the overall structure of the graph and text embeddings for

  Citation Networks","  Due to the rapid growth of scientific publications, identifying all related
reference articles in the literature has become increasingly challenging yet
highly demanding. Existing methods primarily assess candidate publications from
a static perspective, focusing on the content of articles and their structural
information, such as citation relationships. There is a lack of research
regarding how to account for the evolving impact among papers on their
embeddings. Toward this goal, this paper introduces a temporal dimension to
paper recommendation strategies. The core idea is to continuously update a
paper's embedding when new citation relationships appear, enhancing its
relevance for future recommendations. Whenever a citation relationship is added
to the literature upon the publication of a paper, the embeddings of the two
related papers are updated through a Temporal Graph Neural Network (TGN). A
learnable memory update module based on a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is
utilized to study the evolution of the embedding of a paper in order to predict
its reference impact in a future timestamp. Such a TGN-based model learns a
pattern of how people's views of the paper may evolve, aiming to guide paper
recommendations more precisely. Extensive experiments on an open citation
network dataset, including 313,278 articles from

effectiveness of the proposed approach.

paper has gained after a period of time. Prior work viewed this as a static
prediction task. As papers and their citations evolve over time, considering
the dynamics of the number of citations a paper will receive would seem
logical. Here, we introduce the task of sequence citation prediction. The goal
is to accurately predict the trajectory of the number of citations a scholarly
work receives over time. We propose to view papers as a structured network of
citations, allowing us to use topological information as a learning signal.
Additionally, we learn how this dynamic citation network changes over time and
the impact of paper meta-data such as authors, venues and abstracts. To
approach the new task, we derive a dynamic citation network from Semantic
Scholar spanning over 42 years. We present a model which exploits topological
and temporal information using graph convolution networks paired with sequence
prediction, and compare it against multiple baselines, testing the importance
of topological and temporal information and analyzing model performance. Our
experiments show that leveraging both the temporal and topological information
greatly increases the performance of predicting citation counts over time.

will receive. However, most commonly used models may underestimate the
influence of newly published papers over time, and fail to encapsulate this
dynamics of citation network into the graph. In this study, we construct
hierarchical and heterogeneous graphs for target papers with an annual
perspective. The constructed graphs can record the annual dynamics of target
papers' scientific context information. Then, a novel graph neural network,
Hierarchical and Heterogeneous Contrastive Graph Learning Model (H2CGL), is
proposed to incorporate heterogeneity and dynamics of the citation network.
H2CGL separately aggregates the heterogeneous information for each year and
prioritizes the highly-cited papers and relationships among references,
citations, and the target paper. It then employs a weighted GIN to capture
dynamics between heterogeneous subgraphs over years. Moreover, it leverages
contrastive learning to make the graph representations more sensitive to
potential citations. Particularly, co-cited or co-citing papers of the target
paper with large citation gap are taken as hard negative samples, while
randomly dropping low-cited papers could generate positive samples. Extensive
experimental results on two scholarly datasets demonstrate that the proposed
H2CGL significantly outperforms a series of baseline approaches for both
previously and freshly published papers. Additional analyses highlight the
