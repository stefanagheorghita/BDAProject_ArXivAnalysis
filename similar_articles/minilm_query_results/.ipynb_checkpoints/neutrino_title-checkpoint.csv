text,Neutrino decays as a natural explanation of the neutrino mass tension,1,1601.06929,hep-ph,0.47395995259284973,Recent developments in Neutrino Physics,"  We discuss the recent progress in neutrino physics in the following fields:
(i) interpretation of the short and long neutrino oscillation data in terms of
neutrino flavor transitions; (ii) models for neutrino masses and mixings.

text,Neutrino decays as a natural explanation of the neutrino mass tension,2,1201.6158,hep-ph,0.48010900616645813,Neutrino Physics,"  These lectures aim at providing a pedagogical overview of neutrino physics.
We will mostly deal with standard neutrinos, the ones that are part of the
Standard Model of particle physics, and with their standard dynamics, which is
enough to understand in a coherent picture most of the rich data available.
After introducing the basic theoretical framework, we will illustrate the
experimental determination of the neutrino parameters and their theoretical
implications, in particular for the origin of neutrino masses.

text,Neutrino decays as a natural explanation of the neutrino mass tension,4,0808.0812,hep-ph,0.4874705672264099,Theory of the Neutrino Mass,"  Theoretical aspects of neutrino physics are reviewed, with emphasis on
possible explanations of the smallness of neutrino masses and of the peculiar
mixing pattern observed in the lepton sector. Some theoretically motivated
frameworks, such as those based on spontaneously broken discrete flavour
symmetries, are discussed, stressing the importance of low-energy observables,
like anomalous magnetic moments, electric dipole moments and lepton flavour
violating transitions, to test further features of these models.

physics. The neutrinos are fantastically numerous in the universe and as such
they have bearing on our understanding of the universe. Therefore, we must
understand the neutrinos, particularly their mass. There is compelling evidence
from solar and atmospheric neutrinos and those from reactors for neutrino
oscillations implying that neutrinos mix and have nonzero mass but without
pinning down their absolute mass. This is reviewed. The implications of
neutrino oscillations and mass squared splitting between neutrinos of different
flavor on pattern of neutrino mass matrix is discussed. In particular, a
neutrino mass matrix, which shows approximate flavor symmetry where the
neutrino mass differences arise from flavor violation in off-diagonal Yukawa
couplings is elaborated on. The implications in double beta decay are also
discussed.

physics and outline possible lines of developement.
  The main topics covered are: neutrino masses, oscillations, solar and
atmospheric evidences, the LSND/MiniBoone, HM, NuTeV anomalies, future
oscillation experiments, beta and 0nu2beta decays, leptogenesis, supernovae,
astrophysics, cosmology, flavour models, RGE corrections, violations of lepton
flavor in charged leptons, statistics.

particle physics. It can be mediated by light massive Majorana neutrinos
(standard interpretation) or by something else (non-standard interpretations).
We review its dependence on the neutrino parameters, its complementarity to
other observables sensitive to neutrino mass, and emphasize its ability to
distinguish different neutrino mass models. Then we discuss mechanisms
different from light Majorana neutrino exchange, and show what can be learned
from those and how they could be tested.

the weak interaction and the nature of neutrinos. Many recent and current
experiments have been focused on the elucidation of neutrino oscillations and
neutrino mass. The quest for the absolute value of neutrino mass continues with
higher precision studies of the tritium beta decay spectrum near the endpoint.
Neutrino oscillations are studied through measurements of reactor neutrinos as
a function of baseline and energy. And experiments searching for neutrinoless
double beta decay seek to discover violation of lepton number and establish the
Majorana nature of neutrino masses.

text,Neutrino decays as a natural explanation of the neutrino mass tension,10,hep-ph/0305245,hep-ph,0.5144410133361816,TASI 2002 lectures on neutrinos,"  We present a pedagogical review of neutrino physics. In the first lecture we
describe the theoretical motivation for neutrino masses, and explain how
neutrino flavor oscillation experiments can probe neutrino masses. In the
second lecture we review the experimental data, and show that it is best
explained if neutrinos are massive. In the third lecture we explain what are
the theoretical implications of the data, in particular, what are the
challenges they impose on models of physics beyond the SM. We give examples of
theoretical models that cope with some of these challenges.

neutrino masses and mixing. This report gives an overview of what we are
learning from the neutrino oscillation experiments, the prospects for the near
term, and the bright future of neutrino mass studies.

text,Neutrino decays as a natural explanation of the neutrino mass tension,12,1408.2864,hep-ph,0.5165497064590454,Neutrino oscillations: brief history and present status,"  A brief review of the problem of neutrino masses and oscillations is given.
In the beginning we present an early history of neutrino masses, mixing and
oscillations. Then we discuss all possibilities of neutrino masses and mixing
(neutrino mass terms). The phenomenology of neutrino oscillations in vacuum is
considered in some details. We present also the neutrino oscillation data and
the seesaw mechanism of the neutrino mass generation.

text,Neutrino decays as a natural explanation of the neutrino mass tension,13,1502.04530,hep-ph,0.5214786529541016,Riddle of the Neutrino Mass,"  We discuss some known approaches and results as well as few new ideas
concerning origins and nature of neutrino mass. The key issues include (i)
connections of neutrino and charged fermions masses, relation between masses
and mixing, energy scale of new physics behind neutrino mass where
possibilities spread from the Planck and GUT masses down to a sub-eV scale. The
data hint two different new physics involved in generation of neutrino mass.
Determination of the CP phase as well as mass hierarchy can play important role
in identification of new physics. It may happen that sterile neutrinos provide
the key to resolve the riddle.

physics beyond the Standard Model of elementary particles. To date, we still do
not know how neutrinos get mass and why their mass is much smaller than that of
their charged fermion cousins. The precise determination of the neutrino mass
spectrum has become one of the central tasks of neutrino physics, providing
critical input for understanding the nature of neutrino mass and extending our
model. The present landscape of the neutrino mass spectrum is reviewed and
explored in this article using data from the neutrino oscillation, cosmology,
and beta decay. In addition, we discuss the possibility of relevant programs
elucidating the neutrino mass spectrum in the coming decades.

text,Neutrino decays as a natural explanation of the neutrino mass tension,16,1505.06254,hep-ph hep-ex,0.5231490135192871,Non standard neutrino interactions,"  Neutrino oscillations have become well-known phenomenon; the measurements of
neutrino mixing angles and mass squared differences are continuously improving.
Future oscillation experiments will eventually determine the remaining unknown
neutrino parameters, namely, the mass ordering, normal or inverted, and the
CP-violating phase. On the other hand, the absolute mass scale of neutrinos
could be probed by cosmological observations, single beta decay as well as by
neutrinoless double beta decay experiments. Furthermore, the last one may shed
light on the nature of neutrinos, Dirac or Majorana, by measuring the effective
Majorana mass of neutrinos. However, the neutrino mass generation mechanism
remains unknown. A well-motivated phenomenological approach to search for new
physics, in the neutrino sector, is that of non-standard interactions. In this
short review, the current constraints in this picture, as well as the
perspectives from future experiments, are discussed.

text,Neutrino decays as a natural explanation of the neutrino mass tension,17,1404.3859,hep-ph,0.5255051851272583,Status of Neutrino Mass and Mixing,"  In the last two decades experiments have established the existence of
neutrino oscillations and most of the related parameters have by now been
measured with reasonable accuracy. These results have accomplished a major
progress for particle physics and cosmology. At present neutrino physics is a
most vital domain of particle physics and cosmology and the existing open
questions are of crucial importance. We review the present status of the
subject, the main lessons that we have learnt so far and discuss the great
challenges that remain in this field.
