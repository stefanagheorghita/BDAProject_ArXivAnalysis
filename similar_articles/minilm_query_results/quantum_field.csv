known that when certain quantities are calculated using perturbation theory the
results are not gauge invariant. The non-gauge invariant terms have to be
removed in order to obtain a physically correct result. In this paper we will
examine this problem and determine why a theory that is supposed to be gauge
invariant produces non-gauge invariant results.

supergravity with cosmological term in 2+1 dimensions, we construct a gauge
theory with many characteristics of Yang-Mills theory. The gauge transformation
mixes two Bosonic fields and one Fermionic field.

text,quantum field theory gauge symmetry,3,1403.6194,hep-th math-ph math.MP,0.6630984544754028,Gaugeon formalism in the framework of generalized BRST symmetry,"  We consider gaugeon formulations which discuss the quantum gauge freedom
covariantly in the framework of generalized BRST transformation for the
Yang-Mills theory as well as the BRST invariant Higgs model. We generalize the
BRST symmetries of both the Yang-Mills theory and the Higgs model by making the
transformation parameter finite and field-dependent. Remarkably, we observe
that the gaugeon Lagrangian which describe the quantum gauge freedom appear
automatically in the effective theories along with the natural shift in gauge
parameters under specific finite field-dependent parameters.

A set of vector gaugeon fields is introduced as a quantum gauge freedom. One of
the gaugeon fields satisfies a higher derivative field equation; this property
is necessary to change the gauge-fixing parameter of the two-form gauge field.
A naive Lagrangian for the vector gaugeon fields is itself invariant under a
gauge transformation for the vector gaugeon field. The Lagrangian of our theory
includes the gauge-fixing terms for the gaugeon fields and corresponding
Faddeev--Popov ghosts terms.

  Augmented Superfield Formalism","  We derive the local, covariant, continuous, anticommuting and off-shell
nilpotent (anti-)BRST symmetry transformations for the interacting U(1) gauge
theory of quantum electrodynamics (QED) in the framework of augmented
superfield approach to BRST formalism. In addition to the horizontality
condition, we invoke another gauge invariant condition on the six (4,
2)-dimensional supermanifold to obtain the exact and unique nilpotent symmetry
transformations for all the basic fields, present in the (anti-)BRST invariant
Lagrangian density of the physical four (3 + 1)-dimensional QED. The above
supermanifold is parametrized by four even spacetime variables x^\mu (with \mu
= 0, 1, 2, 3) and a couple of odd variables (\theta and \bar\theta) of the
Grassmann algebra. The new gauge invariant condition on the supermanifold owes
its origin to the (super) covariant derivatives and leads to the derivation of
unique nilpotent symmetry transformations for the matter fields. The
geometrical interpretations for all the above off-shell nilpotent
transformations are discussed, too.

gauge group, a compact symmetry group and a base manifold which is regularly
foliated by the orbits of the symmetry group is derived. A generalization of
Wang's theorem (classifying the invariant connections) is proven and local
expressions for the gauge potential of an invariant connection are given.

modification of the Polchinski proof based on the introduction of a cutoff
function. We work with a Poincare' invariant deformation of the ordinary
point-wise product of fields introduced by Ardalan, Arfaei, Ghasemkhani and
Sadooghi, and show that it yields, through a limiting procedure of the cutoff
functions, to a regularized theory, preserving all symmetries at every stage.
The new gauge symmetry yields a new Hopf algebra with deformed co-structures,
which is inequivalent to the standard one.

  field theory","  We investigate various aspects of invariance under local symmetries in the
framework of perturbative algebraic quantum field theory (pAQFT). Our main
result is the proof that the quantum Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) operator,
on-shell, can be written as the commutator with the interacting BRST charge. Up
to now, this was proven only for a certain class of fields in quantum
electrodynamics and in Yang-Mills theory. Our result is more general and it
holds in a wide class of theories with local symmetries, including general
relativity and the bosonic string. We also comment on other issues related to
local gauge invariance and, using the language of homological algebra, we
compare different approaches to quantization of gauge theories in the pAQFT
framework.

text,quantum field theory gauge symmetry,11,2511.23350,hep-th,0.6346856355667114,Generalised Symmetries and Manifest Duality I: Flat Spacetime,"We present a novel, manifestly Lorentz-invariant, polynomial, and straightforwardly quantisable action for duality-symmetric gauge theories formulated using gauge potentials. Central to our construction is the identification of a harmonic higher-form symmetry which uniquely determines the field-strength and resolves the tension between Bianchi identities and dynamical equations of motion. Gauging this symmetry reproduces the flux-based description due to Sen and shows that the quantum consistency checks established for Sen's formalism are automatically subsumed by our action. Unlike Sen's flux-based formalism, our framework admits a simple minimal coupling to matter, the Witten effect, and extends readily to non-Abelian gauge fields. The new action admits remarkably simple supersymmetrisation. Using this action, we derive self-dual Yang-Mills equations from first principles and demonstrate the formalism explicitly for quantum electro-magnetodynamics in $D=4$. We also present a proof of charge quantisation that applies equally to ours and Sen's formulations."

  examples","  Gauge symmetries are a cornerstone of modern physics but they come with
technical difficulties when it comes to quantization, to accurately describe
particles phenomenology or to extract observables in general. These
shortcomings must be met by essentially finding a way to effectively reduce
gauge symmetries. We propose a review of a way to do so which we call the
dressing field method. We show how the BRST algebra satisfied by gauge fields,
encoding their gauge transformations, is modified. We outline noticeable
applications of the method, such as the electroweak sector of the Standard
Model and the local twistors of Penrose.

(SymTFT) associated to a Quantum Field Theory (QFT) with continuous non-abelian
$G$-flavor symmetry is a $BF$-theory with gauge group $G$. We show that gauging
$G$-symmetry with a flat connection yields a theory with global symmetry
characterized by exchanging the conjugate variables in the quantization of
$BF$-theory. We construct the extended operators that generate the $G$-flavor
symmetry and the $(d-2)$-form $\text{Rep}(G)$-symmetry of the gauged QFT. We
demonstrate that $BF$-theory arises as the theory characterizing $G$-flavor
symmetry of a QFT in the AdS/CFT setup. 't Hooft anomalies of the $G$-flavor
symmetry are realized as extra terms in the action.

Schr\""odinger representation formulation of quantum field theory. The analysis
is presented for three-dimensional space-time abelian gauge theories with
either Maxwell, Maxwell-Chern-Simons, or pure Chern-Simons terms as the gauge
field contribution to the action, each of which leads to a different form of
mass generation for the gauge fields.

that the classical massive Yang-Mills theory and the pure Yang-Mills theory
whose gauge symmetry is broken by a gauge fixing term are identical from the
view point of quantum gauge symmetry. The explicit infinitesimal
transformations which leave the massive Yang-Mills theory BRST invariant are
given.

text,quantum field theory gauge symmetry,17,1608.01515,hep-th cond-mat.stat-mech gr-qc,0.5866187810897827,Gauge symmetry from decoupling,"  Gauge symmetries emerge from a redundant description of the effective action
for light degrees of freedom after the decoupling of heavy modes. This
redundant description avoids the use of explicit constraints in configuration
space. For non-linear constraints the gauge symmetries are non-linear. In a
quantum field theory setting the gauge symmetries are local and can describe
Yang-Mills theories or quantum gravity. We formulate gauge invariant fields
that correspond to the non-linear light degrees of freedom. In the context of
functional renormalization gauge symmetries can emerge if the flow generates or
preserves large mass-like terms for the heavy degrees of freedom. They
correspond to a particular form of gauge fixing terms in quantum field
theories.

with respect to different gauge fixing mechanisms.

text,quantum field theory gauge symmetry,20,1702.02027,physics.gen-ph hep-th,0.5566954016685486,Quantum gauge symmetry of reducible gauge theory,"  We derive the gaugeon formalism of the Kalb-Ramond field theory, a reducible
gauge theory, which discusses the quantum gauge freedom. In gaugeon formalism,
theory admits quantum gauge symmetry which leaves the action form-invariant.
The BRST symmetric gaugeon formalism is also studied which introduces the
gaugeon ghost fields and gaugeon ghosts of ghosts fields. To replace the
Yokoyama subsidiary conditions by a single Kugo-Ojima type condition the virtue
of BRST symmetry is utilized. Under generalized BRST transformations, we show
that the gaugeon fields appear naturally in the reducible gauge theory.
