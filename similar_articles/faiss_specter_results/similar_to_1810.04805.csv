understanding (NLU), and achieved state-of-the-art accuracy in various NLU
tasks, such as sentiment classification, natural language inference, semantic

exploration work of Elman [8], we extend BERT to a new model, StructBERT, by
incorporating language structures into pre-training. Specifically, we pre-train
StructBERT with two auxiliary tasks to make the most of the sequential order of
words and sentences, which leverage language structures at the word and
sentence levels, respectively. As a result, the new model is adapted to
different levels of language understanding required by downstream tasks. The
StructBERT with structural pre-training gives surprisingly good empirical
results on a variety of downstream tasks, including pushing the
state-of-the-art on the GLUE benchmark to 89.0 (outperforming all published

primarily based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with attention. Despite
their success, these models are often slow for both training and inference due
to the sequential nature of RNNs. We propose a new Q\&A architecture called
QANet, which does not require recurrent networks: Its encoder consists
exclusively of convolution and self-attention, where convolution models local
interactions and self-attention models global interactions. On the SQuAD
dataset, our model is 3x to 13x faster in training and 4x to 9x faster in
inference, while achieving equivalent accuracy to recurrent models. The
speed-up gain allows us to train the model with much more data. We hence
combine our model with data generated by backtranslation from a neural machine
translation model. On the SQuAD dataset, our single model, trained with
augmented data, achieves 84.6 F1 score on the test set, which is significantly
better than the best published F1 score of 81.8.

separate perspectives of data processing, pre-training tasks, neural network

corpora, only very light supervised fine-tuning is needed to learn a task: the
number of fine-tuning steps is typically five orders of magnitude lower than
the total parameter count. Does this mean that fine-tuning only introduces
small differences from the pre-trained model in the parameter space? If so, can
one avoid storing and computing an entire model for each task? In this work, we
address these questions by using Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers (BERT) as an example. As expected, we find that the fine-tuned
models are close in parameter space to the pre-trained one, with the closeness
varying from layer to layer. We show that it suffices to fine-tune only the
most critical layers. Further, we find that there are surprisingly many good
solutions in the set of sparsified versions of the pre-trained model. As a
result, fine-tuning of huge language models can be achieved by simply setting a

id,1810.04805,"BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language
  Understanding","  We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands
for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent
language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep
bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on
both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT
model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create
state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering
and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture
modifications.
  BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new
state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including
pushing the GLUE score to 80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI
accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering
Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1
(5.1 point absolute improvement).
",15,1901.11504,0.9431511163711548,Multi-Task Deep Neural Networks for Natural Language Understanding,cs.CL,"  In this paper, we present a Multi-Task Deep Neural Network (MT-DNN) for
learning representations across multiple natural language understanding (NLU)
tasks. MT-DNN not only leverages large amounts of cross-task data, but also
benefits from a regularization effect that leads to more general
representations in order to adapt to new tasks and domains. MT-DNN extends the
model proposed in Liu et al. (2015) by incorporating a pre-trained
bidirectional transformer language model, known as BERT (Devlin et al., 2018).
MT-DNN obtains new state-of-the-art results on ten NLU tasks, including SNLI,
SciTail, and eight out of nine GLUE tasks, pushing the GLUE benchmark to 82.7%
(2.2% absolute improvement). We also demonstrate using the SNLI and SciTail
datasets that the representations learned by MT-DNN allow domain adaptation
with substantially fewer in-domain labels than the pre-trained BERT
representations. The code and pre-trained models are publicly available at
https://github.com/namisan/mt-dnn.

  Multi-Task Learning",cs.LG cs.CL stat.ML,"  Multi-task learning shares information between related tasks, sometimes
reducing the number of parameters required. State-of-the-art results across
multiple natural language understanding tasks in the GLUE benchmark have
previously used transfer from a single large task: unsupervised pre-training
with BERT, where a separate BERT model was fine-tuned for each task. We explore
multi-task approaches that share a single BERT model with a small number of
additional task-specific parameters. Using new adaptation modules, PALs or
`projected attention layers', we match the performance of separately fine-tuned
models on the GLUE benchmark with roughly 7 times fewer parameters, and obtain
state-of-the-art results on the Recognizing Textual Entailment dataset.

  Generation, Translation, and Comprehension",cs.CL cs.LG stat.ML,"  We present BART, a denoising autoencoder for pretraining sequence-to-sequence
models. BART is trained by (1) corrupting text with an arbitrary noising
function, and (2) learning a model to reconstruct the original text. It uses a
standard Tranformer-based neural machine translation architecture which,
despite its simplicity, can be seen as generalizing BERT (due to the
bidirectional encoder), GPT (with the left-to-right decoder), and many other
more recent pretraining schemes. We evaluate a number of noising approaches,
finding the best performance by both randomly shuffling the order of the
original sentences and using a novel in-filling scheme, where spans of text are
replaced with a single mask token. BART is particularly effective when fine
tuned for text generation but also works well for comprehension tasks. It
matches the performance of RoBERTa with comparable training resources on GLUE
and SQuAD, achieves new state-of-the-art results on a range of abstractive
dialogue, question answering, and summarization tasks, with gains of up to 6
ROUGE. BART also provides a 1.1 BLEU increase over a back-translation system
for machine translation, with only target language pretraining. We also report
ablation experiments that replicate other pretraining schemes within the BART
framework, to better measure which factors most influence end-task performance.

in various natural language processing tasks, such as machine translation,
language modeling, and question answering. These models contain hundreds of
millions of parameters, necessitating a large amount of computation and making
them prone to overfitting. In this work, we explore LayerDrop, a form of
structured dropout, which has a regularization effect during training and
allows for efficient pruning at inference time. In particular, we show that it
is possible to select sub-networks of any depth from one large network without
having to finetune them and with limited impact on performance. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach by improving the state of the art on machine
translation, language modeling, summarization, question answering, and language
understanding benchmarks. Moreover, we show that our approach leads to small
BERT-like models of higher quality compared to training from scratch or using
distillation.

",19,1912.07076,0.9397298693656921,Multilingual is not enough: BERT for Finnish,cs.CL,"  Deep learning-based language models pretrained on large unannotated text
corpora have been demonstrated to allow efficient transfer learning for natural
language processing, with recent approaches such as the transformer-based BERT
model advancing the state of the art across a variety of tasks. While most work
on these models has focused on high-resource languages, in particular English,
a number of recent efforts have introduced multilingual models that can be
fine-tuned to address tasks in a large number of different languages. However,
we still lack a thorough understanding of the capabilities of these models, in
particular for lower-resourced languages. In this paper, we focus on Finnish
and thoroughly evaluate the multilingual BERT model on a range of tasks,
comparing it with a new Finnish BERT model trained from scratch. The new
language-specific model is shown to systematically and clearly outperform the
multilingual. While the multilingual model largely fails to reach the
performance of previously proposed methods, the custom Finnish BERT model
establishes new state-of-the-art results on all corpora for all reference
tasks: part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and dependency
parsing. We release the model and all related resources created for this study

",20,2205.11726,0.9393975734710693,On the Role of Bidirectionality in Language Model Pre-Training,cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG,"  Prior work on language model pre-training has explored different
architectures and learning objectives, but differences in data, hyperparameters
and evaluation make a principled comparison difficult. In this work, we focus
on bidirectionality as a key factor that differentiates existing approaches,
and present a comprehensive study of its role in next token prediction, text
infilling, zero-shot priming and fine-tuning. We propose a new framework that
generalizes prior approaches, including fully unidirectional models like GPT,
fully bidirectional models like BERT, and hybrid models like CM3 and prefix LM.
Our framework distinguishes between two notions of bidirectionality
(bidirectional context and bidirectional attention) and allows us to control
each of them separately. We find that the optimal configuration is largely
application-dependent (e.g., bidirectional attention is beneficial for
fine-tuning and infilling, but harmful for next token prediction and zero-shot
priming). We train models with up to 6.7B parameters, and find differences to
remain consistent at scale. While prior work on scaling has focused on
left-to-right autoregressive models, our results suggest that this approach
comes with some trade-offs, and it might be worthwhile to develop very large
bidirectional models.
