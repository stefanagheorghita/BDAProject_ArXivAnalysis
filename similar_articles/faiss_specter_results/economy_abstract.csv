Building on our previous studies, which establish Navier-Stokes-based approaches to spatial treatment effects and financial network fragility, we demonstrate that technology adoption spreads simultaneously through both geographic proximity and supply chain connections. Using comprehensive data on six technologies adopted by 500 firms over 2010-2023, we document three key findings. First, technology adoption exhibits strong exponential geographic decay with spatial decay rate $\kappa \approx 0.043$ per kilometer, implying a spatial boundary of $d^* \approx 69$ kilometers beyond which spillovers are negligible (R-squared = 0.99). Second, supply chain connections create technology-specific networks whose algebraic connectivity ($\lambda_2$) increases 300-380 percent as adoption spreads, with correlation between $\lambda_2$ and adoption exceeding 0.95 across all technologies. Third, traditional difference-in-differences methods that ignore spatial and network structure exhibit 61 percent bias in estimated treatment effects. An event study around COVID-19 reveals that network fragility increased 24.5 percent post-shock, amplifying treatment effects through supply chain spillovers in a manner analogous to financial contagion documented in our recent study. Our framework provides micro-foundations for technology policy: interventions have spatial reach of 69 kilometers and network amplification factor of 10.8, requiring coordinated geographic and supply chain targeting for optimal effectiveness."

social and economic networks are often driven by cascading mechanisms, and so
are contagion dynamics in financial networks. Global behaviors generally emerge
from the interplay between the structure of the interconnection topology and
the local agents' interactions. We focus on the Linear Threshold Model (LTM) of
cascades first introduced by Granovetter (1978). This can be interpreted as the
best response dynamics in a network game whereby agents choose strategically
between two actions and their payoff is an increasing function of the number of
their neighbors choosing the same action. Each agent is equipped with an
individual threshold representing the number of her neighbors who must have
adopted a certain action for that to become the agent's best response. We
analyze the LTM dynamics on large-scale networks with heterogeneous agents.
Through a local mean-field approach, we obtain a nonlinear, one-dimensional,
recursive equation that approximates the evolution of the LTM dynamics on most
of the networks of a given size and distribution of degrees and thresholds.
Specifically, we prove that, on all but a fraction of networks with given
degree and threshold statistics that is vanishing as the network size grows
large, the actual fraction of adopters of a given action in the LTM dynamics is
arbitrarily close to the output of the aforementioned recursion. We then
analyze the dynamic behavior of this recursion and its bifurcations from a
dynamical systems viewpoint. Applications of our findings to some real network
testbeds show good adherence of the theoretical predictions to numerical
simulations.

Previous studies have extensively examined pairwise transmission and local reinforcement. However, the role of macro-level social influence -- where widespread adoption enhances further adoption -- remains understudied. Here, we focus on a contagion process that incorporates both pairwise interactions and macro-level reinforcement. We show that the contagion undergoes a shift from continuous to mixed-order transition as macro-level influence exceeds a reinforcement threshold. Simulations on various real-world networks indicate that network localization governs the contagion outcomes by determining the critical point and the reinforcement threshold. Building on this insight, we develop a structural metric linking network localization to contagion dynamics, revealing a key trade-off: networks that facilitate weak contagion tend to experience slower diffusion and lower adoption rates, while networks that suppress weak contagions enable faster and more widespread adoption. These findings challenge the conventional belief that stronger local connectivity uniformly promotes contagion."

Development (R&D) networks. Empirical evidence has shown that the growth of
these networks is driven by mechanisms which are both endogenous to the system
(that is, depending on existing alliances patterns) and exogenous (that is,
driven by an exploratory search for newcomer firms). Extant research to date
has not investigated both mechanisms simultaneously in a comparative manner. To
overcome this limitation, we develop a general modeling framework to shed light
on the relative importance of these two mechanisms. We test our model against a
comprehensive dataset, listing cross-country and cross-sectoral R&D alliances
from 1984 to 2009. Our results show that by fitting only three macroscopic
properties of the network topology, this framework is able to reproduce a
number of micro-level measures, including the distributions of degree, local
clustering, path length and component size, and the emergence of network
clusters. Furthermore, by estimating the link probabilities towards newcomers
and established firms from the data, we find that endogenous mechanisms are
predominant over the exogenous ones in the network formation, thus quantifying
the importance of existing structures in selecting partner firms.

We derive a master equation governing propagation from three economic foundations -- heterogeneous agent aggregation, market equilibrium, and cost minimization -- establishing that the framework rests on fundamental principles rather than ad hoc specifications.

The Feynman-Kac representation decomposes effects into inherited and accumulated components along stochastic paths representing economic linkages. The framework nests the no-spillover case as a testable restriction. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that conventional estimators -- two-way fixed effects, difference-in-differences, and generalized propensity score -- exhibit 25-38% bias and severe undercoverage when spillovers exist, while our estimator maintains correct inference regardless of whether spillovers are present. Applying the framework to U.S. minimum wage policy, we reject the no-spillover null and find total effects at state borders four times larger than direct effects -- conventional methods capture only one-quarter of policy impact.

I develop an econometric framework that rationalizes the dynamics of cross-sectional variables as the innovation transmission along fixed bilateral links and that can accommodate rich patterns of how network effects of higher order accumulate over time. The proposed Network-VAR (NVAR) can be used to estimate dynamic network effects, with the network given or inferred from dynamic cross-correlations in the data. In the latter case, it also offers a dimensionality-reduction technique for modeling high-dimensional (cross-sectional) processes, owing to networks' ability to summarize complex relations among variables (units) by relatively few bilateral links. In a first application, I show that sectoral output growth in an RBC economy with lagged input-output conversion follows an NVAR. I characterize impulse-responses to TFP shocks in this environment, and I estimate that the lagged transmission of productivity shocks along supply chains can account for a third of the persistence in aggregate output growth. The remainder is due to persistence in the aggregate TFP process, leaving a negligible role for persistence in sectoral TFP. In a second application, I forecast macroeconomic aggregates across OECD countries by assuming and estimating a network that underlies the dynamics. In line with an equivalence result I provide, this reduces out-of-sample mean squared errors relative to a dynamic factor model. The reductions range from -12% for quarterly real GDP growth to -68% for monthly CPI inflation."

as a spreading process driven to large extent by social influence and
conditioned by the needs and capacities of individuals. To model this process
one usually introduces behavioural threshold mechanisms, which can give rise to
the evolution of global cascades if the system satisfies a set of conditions.
However, these models do not address temporal aspects of the emerging cascades,
which in real systems may evolve through various pathways ranging from slow to
rapid patterns. Here we fill this gap through the analysis and modelling of
product adoption in the world's largest voice over internet service, the social
network of Skype. We provide empirical evidence about the heterogeneous
distribution of fractional behavioural thresholds, which appears to be
independent of the degree of adopting egos. We show that the structure of
real-world adoption clusters is radically different from previous theoretical
expectations, since vulnerable adoptions --induced by a single adopting
neighbour-- appear to be important only locally, while spontaneous adopters
arriving at a constant rate and the involvement of unconcerned individuals
govern the global emergence of social spreading.

robustness of a large set of network indicators, thus providing a more complete
description of R&D networks with respect to the existing literature. We find
that most network properties are not only invariant across sectors, but also
independent of the scale of aggregation at which they are observed, and we
highlight the presence of core-periphery architectures in explaining some
properties emphasized in previous empirical studies (e.g. asymmetric degree
distributions and small worlds). In addition, we show that many properties of
R&D networks are characterized by a rise-and-fall dynamics with a peak in the
mid-nineties. We find that such dynamics is driven by mechanisms of
accumulative advantage, structural homophily and multiconnectivity. In
particular, the change from the ""rise"" to the ""fall"" phase is associated to a

We extend the Navier-Stokes-based approach from our previous studies to characterize contagion dynamics in the European banking system through the spectral properties of network evolution operators. Using high-quality bilateral exposure data from the European Banking Authority Transparency Exercise (2014-2023), we estimate the causal impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on network fragility using spatial difference-in-differences methods adapted from our previous studies. Our empirical analysis reveals that COVID-19 elevated network fragility, measured by the algebraic connectivity $\lambda_2$ of the system Laplacian, by 26.9% above pre-pandemic levels (95% CI: [7.4%, 46.5%], p<0.05), with effects persisting through 2023. Paradoxically, this occurred despite a 46% reduction in the number of banks, demonstrating that consolidation increased systemic vulnerability by intensifying interconnectedness-consistent with theoretical predictions from continuous spatial dynamics. Our findings validate the key predictions from \citet{kikuchi2024dynamical}: treatment effects amplify over time through spatial spillovers, consolidation increases fragility when coupling strength rises, and systems exhibit structural hysteresis preventing automatic reversion to pre-shock equilibria. The results demonstrate the empirical relevance of continuous functional methods for financial stability analysis and provide new insights for macroprudential policy design.

dependent on network topology. To study this, we choose economic production
networks as a paradigm. An economic network can be examined at many levels:
linkages among individual agents (microscopic), among firms/sectors
(mesoscopic) or among countries (macroscopic). New emergent dynamical
properties appear at every level, so the granularity matters. For viral
epidemics, even an individual node may act as an epicenter of distress and
potentially affect the entire network. Economic networks, however, are known to
be immune at the micro-levels and more prone to failure in the
meso/macro-levels. We propose a dynamical interaction model to characterize the
mechanism of distress propagation, across different modules of a network,
initiated at different epicenters. Vulnerable modules often lead to large
degrees of destabilization. We demonstrate our methodology using a unique
empirical data-set of input-output linkages across 0.14 million firms in one
administrative state of India, a developing economy. The network has multiple
hub-and-spoke structures that exhibits moderate disassortativity, which varies
with the level of coarse-graining. The novelty lies in characterizing the
production network at different levels of granularity or modularity, and
finding `too-big-to-fail' modules supersede `too-central-to-fail' modules in
distress propagation.

time-dependent probabilities of firms leaving the network and simulate drop-out

deviations from these expectations result from the adaptivity of the network,
which mitigates the decline. These deviations can be used as a measure of

This paper develops a unified spatial-network framework to analyze systemic risk dynamics, revealing three critical findings that challenge conventional wisdom. First, banking consolidation paradoxically increased systemic fragility: while bank numbers declined 47.3% from 2007 to 2023, network fragility measured by algebraic connectivity rose 315.8%, demonstrating that interconnectedness intensity dominates institutional count. Second, financial contagion propagates globally with negligible spatial decay (boundary d* = 47,474 km), contrasting sharply with localized technology diffusion (d* = 69 km)--a scale difference of 688 times. Third, traditional difference-in-differences methods overestimate crisis impacts by 73.2% when ignoring network structure, producing severely biased policy assessments. Using bilateral exposure data from 156 institutions across 28 countries (2007-2023) and employing spectral analysis of network Laplacian operators combined with spatial difference-in-differences identification, we document that crisis effects amplified over time rather than dissipating, increasing fragility 68.4% above pre-crisis levels with persistent effects through 2023. The consolidation paradox exhibits near-perfect correlation (R = 0.97) between coupling strength and systemic vulnerability, validating theoretical predictions from continuous spatial dynamics. Policy simulations demonstrate network-targeted capital requirements achieve 11.3x amplification effects versus uniform regulations.

Intertwined nature of the dynamics of nodes in such network makes it difficult
to disentangle the source and destination of a shock that percolates through
the network, a property known as reflexivity. In this article, a novel
methodology is proposed which combines vector autoregression model with an
unique identification restrictions obtained from the topological structure of
the network to uniquely characterize cascades. In particular, we show that
planarity of the network allows us to statistically estimate a dynamical
process consistent with the observed network and thereby uniquely identify a
path for shock propagation from any chosen epicenter to all other nodes in the
network. We analyze the distress propagation mechanism in closed loops giving
rise to a detailed picture of the effect of feedback loops in transmitting
shocks. We show usefulness and applications of the algorithm in two networks
with dynamics at different time-scales: worldwide GDP growth network and stock
network. In both cases, we observe that the model predicts the impact of the
shocks emanating from the US would be concentrated within the cluster of
developed countries and the developing countries show very muted response,
which is consistent with empirical observations over the past decade.

  financial networks",q-fin.GN physics.soc-ph,"  The 2008 financial crisis illustrated the need for a thorough, functional
understanding of systemic risk in strongly interconnected financial structures.
Dynamic processes on complex networks being intrinsically difficult, most
recent studies of this problem have relied on numerical simulations. Here we
report analytical results in a network model of interbank lending based on
directly relevant financial parameters, such as interest rates and leverage
ratios. Using a mean-field approach, we obtain a closed-form formula for the
""critical degree"", viz. the number of creditors per bank below which an
individual shock can propagate throughout the network. We relate the failures
distribution (probability that a single shock induces $F$ failures) to the
degree distribution (probability that a bank has $k$ creditors), showing in
particular that the former is fat-tailed whenever the latter is. Our criterion
for the onset of contagion turns out to be isomorphic to the condition for
cooperation to evolve on graphs and social networks, as recently formulated in
evolutionary game theory. This remarkable connection supports recent calls for
a methodological rapprochement between finance and ecology.

  Multivariate Financial Time Series",stat.AP,"  Current understanding holds that financial contagion is driven mainly by the
system-wide interconnectedness of institutions. A distinction has been made
between systematic and idiosyncratic channels of contagion, with shocks
transmitted through the latter expected to be substantially more likely to lead
to systemic crisis than through the former. Idiosyncratic connectivity is
thought to be driven not simply by obviously shared characteristics among
institutions, but more by latent characteristics that lead to the holding of
related securities. We develop a graphical model for multivariate financial
time series with interest in uncovering the latent positions of nodes in a
network intended to capture idiosyncratic relationships. We propose a
hierarchical model consisting of a VAR, a covariance graphical model (CGM) and
a latent position model (LPM). The VAR enables us to extract useful information
on the idiosyncratic components, which are used by the CGM to model the network
and the LPM uncovers the spatial position of the nodes. We also develop a
Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm that iterates between sampling parameters of
the CGM and the LPM, using samples from the latter to update prior information
for covariance graph selection. We show empirically that modeling the
idiosyncratic channel of contagion using our approach can relate latent
institutional features to systemic vulnerabilities prior to a crisis.

We model financial distress propagation as a diffusion process on weighted networks, deriving a network diffusion equation from first principles that predicts contagion decay depends on the network's algebraic connectivity through the relation $\kappa = \sqrt{\lambda_2/D}$, where $\lambda_2$ is the second-smallest eigenvalue of the graph Laplacian and $D$ is the diffusion coefficient. Applying this framework to European banking data from the EBA stress tests (2018, 2021, 2023), we estimate interbank exposure networks using maximum entropy methods and track the evolution of systemic risk through the COVID-19 crisis. Our key finding is that network connectivity declined by 45\% from 2018 to 2023, implying a 26\% reduction in the contagion decay parameter. Difference-in-differences analysis reveals this structural change was driven by regulatory-induced deleveraging of systemically important banks, which experienced differential asset reductions of 17\% relative to smaller institutions. The networks exhibit lognormal rather than scale-free degree distributions, suggesting greater resilience than previously assumed in the literature. Extensive robustness checks across parametric and non-parametric estimation methods confirm declining systemic risk, with cross-method correlations exceeding 0.95. These findings demonstrate that post-COVID-19 regulatory reforms effectively reduced network interconnectedness and systemic vulnerability in the European banking system."

  formation in economic networks",stat.ME stat.AP,"  Networks are ubiquitous in economic research on organizations, trade, and
many other areas. However, while economic theory extensively considers
networks, no general framework for their empirical modeling has yet emerged. We
thus introduce two different statistical models for this purpose -- the
Exponential Random Graph Model (ERGM) and the Additive and Multiplicative
Effects network model (AME). Both model classes can account for network
interdependencies between observations, but differ in how they do so. The ERGM
allows one to explicitly specify and test the influence of particular network
structures, making it a natural choice if one is substantively interested in
estimating endogenous network effects. In contrast, AME captures these effects
by introducing actor-specific latent variables affecting their propensity to
form ties. This makes the latter a good choice if the researcher is interested
in capturing the effect of exogenous covariates on tie formation without having
a specific theory on the endogenous dependence structures at play. After
introducing the two model classes, we showcase them through real-world
applications to networks stemming from international arms trade and foreign
exchange activity. We further provide full replication materials to facilitate
the adoption of these methods in empirical economic research.

default contagion in the interbank market. We model the market as a random
directed network, where the vertices represent financial institutions and the
weighted edges monetary exposures between them. Our model captures the strong
degree of heterogeneity observed in empirical data and the parameters can
easily be fitted to real data sets. One of our main results allows us to
determine the impact of local shocks, where initially some banks default, to
the entire system and the wider economy. Here the impact is measured by some
index of total systemic importance of all eventually defaulted institutions. As
a central application, we characterize resilient and non-resilient cases. In
particular, for the prominent case where the network has a degree sequence
without second moment, we show that a small number of initially defaulted banks
can trigger a substantial default cascade. Our results complement and extend
significantly earlier findings derived in the configuration model where the
existence of a second moment of the degree distribution is assumed. As a second
main contribution, paralleling regulatory discussions, we determine minimal
capital requirements for financial institutions sufficient to make the network
resilient to small shocks. An appealing feature of these capital requirements
is that they can be determined locally by each institution without knowing the
complete network structure as they basically only depend on the institution's
exposures to its counterparties.

  Innovation",physics.soc-ph cs.SI econ.GN q-fin.EC,"  When multiple innovations compete for adoption, historical chance leading to
early advantage can generate lock-in effects that allow suboptimal innovations
to succeed at the expense of superior alternatives. Research on the diffusion
of innovafacetion has identified many possible sources of early advantage, but
these mechanisms can benefit both optimal and suboptimal innovations. This
paper moves beyond chance-as-explanation to identify structural principles that
systematically impact the likelihood that the optimal strategy will spread. A
formal model of innovation diffusion shows that the network structure of
organizational relationships can systematically impact the likelihood that
widely adopted innovations will be payoff optimal. Building on prior diffusion
research, this paper focuses on the role of central actors i.e. well-connected
people or firms. While contagion models of diffusion highlight the benefits of
central actors for spreading innovations further and faster, the present
analysis reveals a dark side to this influence: the mere presence of central
actors in a network increases rates of adoption but also increases the
likelihood of suboptimal outcomes. This effect, however, does not represent a
speed-optimality tradeoff, as dense networks are both fast and optimal. This
finding is consistent with related research showing that network centralization
undermines collective intelligence.
