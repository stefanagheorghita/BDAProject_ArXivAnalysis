text,quantum field theory gauge symmetry,1,hep-th/0602185,0.829078197479248,Twist to close,hep-th,"  It has been proposed that the Poincare and some other symmetries of
noncommutative field theories should be twisted. Here we extend this idea to
gauge transformations and find that twisted gauge symmetries close for
arbitrary gauge group. We also analyse twisted-invariant actions in
noncommutative theories.

text,quantum field theory gauge symmetry,2,q-alg/9611007,0.826947808265686,Weak C* Hopf Symmetry,q-alg hep-th math.QA,"  Weak C* Hopf algebras can act as global symmetries in low-dimensional quantum
field theories, when braid group statistics prevents group symmetries.
Possibilities to construct field algebras with weak C* Hopf symmetry from a
given theory of local observables are discussed.

A basic introduction to noncommutative geometry and noncommutative field theory
is given. Background invariant formulation of Wilson lines is proposed. Duality
symmetries relating various noncommutative gauge models are being discussed.

gauge invariant and independent of the choice of gauge breaking terms and the
ghost determinant.

text,quantum field theory gauge symmetry,7,1310.8164,0.8200099468231201,Gauge fields beyond perturbation theory,hep-th,"  A new formulation of nonabelian gauge theories, introducing new ghost fields
and new symmetry is proposed. This formulation does not suffer from Gribov
ambiguity and allows to quantize nonabelian gauge fields beyond perturbation
theory.

text,quantum field theory gauge symmetry,8,1302.3183,0.8184289932250977,Lattice BRST without Neuberger 0/0 problem,hep-th hep-lat,"  We illustrate in a simple toy model how the methods of SUSY quantum mechanics
and topological quantum field theory can be used for covariant gauge-fixing
with unbroken BRST symmetry on a finite lattice.

text,quantum field theory gauge symmetry,9,hep-th/0209005,0.8163421750068665,A Map between q-deformed and ordinary Gauge Theories,hep-th,"  In complete analogy with Seiberg-Witten map defined in noncommutative
geometry we introduce a new map between a q-deformed gauge theory and an
ordinary gauge theory. The construction of this map is elaborated in order to
fit the Hopf algebra structure.

text,quantum field theory gauge symmetry,10,0711.4091,0.8154104351997375,Symmetries in noncommutative field theories: Hopf versus Lie,hep-th,"  I discuss motivations for introducing Hopf algebra symmetries in
noncommutative field theories and briefly describe twisting of main symmetry
transformations. New results include an extended list of twisted gauge
invariants (which may help to overcome the problem of inconsistency of
equations of motion) and a gauge-covariant twist operator (leading to a
gauge-covariant star product).

text,quantum field theory gauge symmetry,11,hep-th/9710224,0.8149499893188477,BRST-co-BRST Quantization of Reparametrization Invariant Theories,hep-th,"  We study some reparametrization invariant theories in context of the
BRST-co-BRST quantization method. The method imposes restrictions on the
possible gauge fixing conditions and leads to well defined inner product states
through a gauge regularisation procedure. Two explicit examples are also
treated in detail.

text,quantum field theory gauge symmetry,12,1205.3293,0.8145594596862793,BRST Symmetry and Cohomology,hep-th,"  We present the mathematical considerations which determine all gauge
invariant actions and anomaly candidates in gauge theories of standard type
such as ordinary or gravitational Yang Mills theories. Starting from elementary
concepts of field theory the discussion tries to be explicit and complete, only
the cohomology of simple Lie algebras it quoted from the literature.

anomalies. It renders gauge fixing unobservable in physical states and is
required if negative norm states are to decouple also in interacting models.
The relevant mathematical structures and the elementary cohomological
investigations are presented.

spin-3/2 Rarita-Schwinger gauge field. The theory admits a quantum gauge
transformation by which we can shift the gauge fixing parameter. The quantum
gauge transformation does not change the BRST charge. Thus, the physical
Hilbert space is trivially independent of the gauge fixing parameter.
