alternative mechanism that may explain current data. In this work, we discuss
possible signals of Lorentz violation in neutrino-oscillation experiments.

the phenomenological V-A theory and the standard model are discussed. The
problem of neutrino masses and mixing is reviewed.

and LSND) which go beyond the ``conventional'' neutrino oscillations induced by
mass-mixing. Several of these require non-zero neutrino masses as well.
"
text,Neutrino decays as a natural explanation of the neutrino mass tension,13,1001.5189,0.9040198922157288,Status of Neutrino Theory,hep-ph,"  A summary of neutrino oscillation results is given along with a discussion of
neutrino mass generation mechanisms, including high and low-scale seesaw, with
and without supersymmetry, as well as recent attempts to understand flavor. I
argue that if the origin of neutrino masses is intrinsically supersymmetric, it
may lead to clear tests at the LHC. Finally, I briefly discuss thermal
leptogenesis and dark matter.
"
text,Neutrino decays as a natural explanation of the neutrino mass tension,14,hep-ph/0506165,0.9033095836639404,Neutrino Physics,hep-ph,"  Thanks to compelling evidence that neutrinos can change flavor, we now know
that they have nonzero masses, and that leptons mix. In these lectures, we
explain the physics of neutrino flavor change, both in vacuum and in matter.
Then, we describe what the flavor-change data have taught us about neutrinos.
Finally, we consider some of the questions raised by the discovery of neutrino
mass, explaining why these questions are so interesting, and how they might be
answered experimentally,

neutrino mixing and oscillation, first in vacuum and then its matter
enhancement. Then the solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillation data are
briefly reviewed. Finally I discuss the problem of reconciling hierarchical
neutrino masses with at least one large mixing, as implied by these data. A
minimal see-saw model for reconciling the two is discussed.

mixing and its A_4 realization, variations of the seesaw mechanism allowing for
observable deviations from unitarity of the neutrino mixing matrix, and the

masses and mixing including a survey of theoretical motivations and models,
experimental searches and implications of recently appeared solar and

addition to the three active ones and two-generation nearly maximal mixing.

text,Neutrino decays as a natural explanation of the neutrino mass tension,20,2310.17685,0.8996760249137878,Neutrino Oscillations and Mass Models,hep-ph,"  These notes provide a review of various neutrino mass model and their
implications for particle physics and the Standard Model. We discuss how mass
terms are incorporated into the Standard Model, including the Dirac mass term
and the Majorana mechanism. We explore experimental evidence supporting the
existence of non-zero neutrino mass and develop the formalism of neutrino
oscillations. Additionally, we provide a brief overview of some famous
radiative neutrino mass models. This notes draws heavily from the references
given below and can serve as a valuable resource for students and new
researchers interested in the field of neutrino physics.
