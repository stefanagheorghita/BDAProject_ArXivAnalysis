  embeddings",cs.CL,"  Introduction: Tracing the spread of ideas and the presence of influence is a
question of special importance across a wide range of disciplines, ranging from
intellectual history to cultural analytics, computational social science, and
the science of science.
  Method: We collect a corpus of open source journal articles, generate
Knowledge Graph representations using the Gemini LLM, and attempt to predict
the existence of citations between sampled pairs of articles using previously
published methods and a novel Graph Neural Network based embedding model.
  Results: We demonstrate that our knowledge graph embedding method is superior
at distinguishing pairs of articles with and without citation. Once trained, it
runs efficiently and can be fine-tuned on specific corpora to suit individual
researcher needs.
  Conclusion(s): This experiment demonstrates that the relationships encoded in
a knowledge graph, especially the types of concepts brought together by
specific relations can encode information capable of revealing intellectual
influence. This suggests that further work in analyzing document level
knowledge graphs to understand latent structures could provide valuable
insights.

In scientometrics, they are also central to the construction of quantitative indicators. Not all citations, however, serve the same function: some provide background, others introduce methods, or compare results. Therefore, understanding citation intent allows for a more nuanced interpretation of scientific impact. In this paper, we adopted a GAN-based method to classify citation intents. Our results revealed that the proposed method achieves competitive classification performance, closely matching state-of-the-art results with substantially fewer parameters. This demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of leveraging GAN architectures combined with contextual embeddings in intent classification task. We also investigated whether filtering citation intents affects the centrality of papers in citation networks. Analyzing the network constructed from the unArXiv dataset, we found that paper rankings can be significantly influenced by citation intent. All four centrality metrics examined- degree, PageRank, closeness, and betweenness - were sensitive to the filtering of citation types. The betweenness centrality displayed the greatest sensitivity, showing substantial changes in ranking when specific citation intents were removed."

Language Processing. While numerous recent text classification models applied
the sequential deep learning technique, graph neural network-based models can
directly deal with complex structured text data and exploit global information.
Many real text classification applications can be naturally cast into a graph,
which captures words, documents, and corpus global features. In this survey, we
bring the coverage of methods up to 2023, including corpus-level and
document-level graph neural networks. We discuss each of these methods in
detail, dealing with the graph construction mechanisms and the graph-based
learning process. As well as the technological survey, we look at issues behind
and future directions addressed in text classification using graph neural
networks. We also cover datasets, evaluation metrics, and experiment design and
present a summary of published performance on the publicly available
benchmarks. Note that we present a comprehensive comparison between different
techniques and identify the pros and cons of various evaluation metrics in this
survey.

publications across the full range of academic fields. Top cited papers
typically reveal future trends in their corresponding domains which is of
importance to both researchers and practitioners. Prior citation prediction
methods often require initial citation trends to be established and do not take
advantage of the recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs). We
present GNN-based architecture that predicts the top set of papers at the time
of publication. For experiments, we curate a set of academic citation graphs
for a variety of conferences and show that the proposed model outperforms other
classic machine learning models in terms of the F1-score.

text,graph neural networks for citation analysis,6,1904.09981,0.7608433961868286,GraphNAS: Graph Neural Architecture Search with Reinforcement Learning,cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML,"  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been popularly used for analyzing
non-Euclidean data such as social network data and biological data. Despite
their success, the design of graph neural networks requires a lot of manual
work and domain knowledge. In this paper, we propose a Graph Neural
Architecture Search method (GraphNAS for short) that enables automatic search
of the best graph neural architecture based on reinforcement learning.
Specifically, GraphNAS first uses a recurrent network to generate
variable-length strings that describe the architectures of graph neural
networks, and then trains the recurrent network with reinforcement learning to
maximize the expected accuracy of the generated architectures on a validation
data set. Extensive experimental results on node classification tasks in both
transductive and inductive learning settings demonstrate that GraphNAS can
achieve consistently better performance on the Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed citation
network, and protein-protein interaction network. On node classification tasks,
GraphNAS can design a novel network architecture that rivals the best
human-invented architecture in terms of test set accuracy.

text,graph neural networks for citation analysis,8,1910.08144,0.7597841024398804,"Explainable Authorship Verification in Social Media via Attention-based
  Similarity Learning",cs.CL,"  Authorship verification is the task of analyzing the linguistic patterns of
two or more texts to determine whether they were written by the same author or
not. The analysis is traditionally performed by experts who consider linguistic
features, which include spelling mistakes, grammatical inconsistencies, and
stylistics for example. Machine learning algorithms, on the other hand, can be
trained to accomplish the same, but have traditionally relied on so-called
stylometric features. The disadvantage of such features is that their
reliability is greatly diminished for short and topically varied social media
texts. In this interdisciplinary work, we propose a substantial extension of a
recently published hierarchical Siamese neural network approach, with which it
is feasible to learn neural features and to visualize the decision-making
process. For this purpose, a new large-scale corpus of short Amazon reviews for
text comparison research is compiled and we show that the Siamese network
topologies outperform state-of-the-art approaches that were built up on
stylometric features. Our linguistic analysis of the internal attention weights
of the network shows that the proposed method is indeed able to latch on to
some traditional linguistic categories.

reflecting how authors frame their work, and influencing uptake by future
scholars. However, our understanding of citation behavior has been limited to
small-scale manual citation analysis. We perform the largest behavioral study
of citations to date, analyzing how citations are both framed and taken up by
scholars in one entire field: natural language processing. We introduce a new
dataset of nearly 2,000 citations annotated for function and centrality, and
use it to develop a state-of-the-art classifier and label the entire ACL
Reference Corpus. We then study how citations are framed by authors and use
both papers and online traces to track how citations are followed by readers.
We demonstrate that authors are sensitive to discourse structure and
publication venue when citing, that online readers follow temporal links to
previous and future work rather than methodological links, and that how a paper
cites related work is predictive of its citation count. Finally, we use changes
in citation roles to show that the field of NLP is undergoing a significant
increase in consensus.

  Evaluation of Graph and Text Embedding Methods",cs.SI physics.soc-ph,"  Recent advances in machine learning offer new ways to represent and study
scholarly works and the space of knowledge. Graph and text embeddings provide a
convenient vector representation of scholarly works based on citations and
text. Yet, it is unclear whether their representations are consistent or
provide different views of the structure of science. Here, we compare graph and
text embedding by testing their ability to capture the hierarchical structure
of the Physics and Astronomy Classification Scheme (PACS) of papers published
by the American Physical Society (APS). We also provide a qualitative
comparison of the overall structure of the graph and text embeddings for
reference. We find that neural network-based methods outperform traditional
methods and graph embedding methods such as node2vec are better than other
methods at capturing the PACS structure. Our results call for further
investigations into how different contexts of scientific papers are captured by
different methods, and how we can combine and leverage such information in an
interpretable manner.

  Learning",cs.LG cs.SI,"  There has been rapid growth in biomedical literature, yet capturing the
heterogeneity of the bibliographic information of these articles remains
relatively understudied. Although graph mining research via heterogeneous graph
neural networks has taken center stage, it remains unclear whether these
approaches capture the heterogeneity of the PubMed database, a vast digital
repository containing over 33 million articles. We introduce PubMed Graph
Benchmark (PGB), a new benchmark dataset for evaluating heterogeneous graph
embeddings for biomedical literature. The benchmark contains rich metadata
including abstract, authors, citations, MeSH terms, MeSH hierarchy, and some
other information. The benchmark contains three different evaluation tasks
encompassing systematic reviews, node classification, and node clustering. In
PGB, we aggregate the metadata associated with the biomedical articles from
PubMed into a unified source and make the benchmark publicly available for any
future works.

  Long Document Extractive Summarization",cs.CL cs.AI,"  Heterogeneous graph neural networks have recently gained attention for long
document summarization, modeling the extraction as a node classification task.
Although effective, these models often require external tools or additional
machine learning models to define graph components, producing highly complex
and less intuitive structures. We present GraphLSS, a heterogeneous graph
construction for long document extractive summarization, incorporating Lexical,
Structural, and Semantic features. It defines two levels of information (words
and sentences) and four types of edges (sentence semantic similarity, sentence
occurrence order, word in sentence, and word semantic similarity) without any
need for auxiliary learning models. Experiments on two benchmark datasets show
that GraphLSS is competitive with top-performing graph-based methods,
outperforming recent non-graph models. We release our code on GitHub.

  review",cs.DL cs.AI,"  This literature review identifies indicators that associate with higher
impact or higher quality research from article text (e.g., titles, abstracts,
lengths, cited references and readability) or metadata (e.g., the number of
authors, international or domestic collaborations, journal impact factors and
authors' h-index). This includes studies that used machine learning techniques
to predict citation counts or quality scores for journal articles or conference
papers. The literature review also includes evidence about the strength of
association between bibliometric indicators and quality score rankings from
previous UK Research Assessment Exercises (RAEs) and REFs in different subjects
and years and similar evidence from other countries (e.g., Australia and
Italy). In support of this, the document also surveys studies that used public
datasets of citations, social media indictors or open review texts (e.g.,
Dimensions, OpenCitations, Altmetric.com and Publons) to help predict the
scholarly impact of articles. The results of this part of the literature review
were used to inform the experiments using machine learning to predict REF
journal article quality scores, as reported in the AI experiments report for
this project. The literature review also covers technology to automate
editorial processes, to provide quality control for papers and reviewers'
suggestions, to match reviewers with articles, and to automatically categorise
journal articles into fields. Bias and transparency in technology assisted
assessment are also discussed.

semi-supervised object classification, whereby we propose to train a
fully-connected network jointly with the graph neural network via parameter
sharing and interpolation-based regularization. Further, we provide a
theoretical analysis of how GraphMix improves the generalization bounds of the
underlying graph neural network, without making any assumptions about the
""aggregation"" layer or the depth of the graph neural networks. We
experimentally validate this analysis by applying GraphMix to various
architectures such as Graph Convolutional Networks, Graph Attention Networks
and Graph-U-Net. Despite its simplicity, we demonstrate that GraphMix can
consistently improve or closely match state-of-the-art performance using even
simpler architectures such as Graph Convolutional Networks, across three
established graph benchmarks: Cora, Citeseer and Pubmed citation network
datasets, as well as three newly proposed datasets: Cora-Full, Co-author-CS and
Co-author-Physics.

challenging and relevant downstream task, given the volume of existing and
newly published articles. We propose a method to enhance the performance of
article classification by enriching simple Graph Neural Network (GNN) pipelines
with multi-graph representations that simultaneously encode multiple signals of
article relatedness, e.g. references, co-authorship, shared publication source,
shared subject headings, as distinct edge types. Fully supervised transductive
node classification experiments are conducted on the Open Graph Benchmark
OGBN-arXiv dataset and the PubMed diabetes dataset, augmented with additional
metadata from Microsoft Academic Graph and PubMed Central, respectively. The
results demonstrate that multi-graphs consistently improve the performance of a
variety of GNN models compared to the default graphs. When deployed with SOTA
textual node embedding methods, the transformed multi-graphs enable simple and
shallow 2-layer GNN pipelines to achieve results on par with more complex
architectures.

This study introduces CiteFusion, an ensemble framework designed to address the multi-class Citation Intent Classification task on two benchmark datasets: SciCite and ACL-ARC. The framework employs a one-vs-all decomposition of the multi-class task into class-specific binary subtasks, leveraging complementary pairs of SciBERT and XLNet models, independently tuned, for each citation intent. The outputs of these base models are aggregated through a feedforward neural network meta-classifier to reconstruct the original classification task. To enhance interpretability, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is employed to analyze token-level contributions, and interactions among base models, providing transparency into the classification dynamics of CiteFusion, and insights about the kind of misclassifications of the ensemble. In addition, this work investigates the semantic role of structural context by incorporating section titles, as framing devices, into input sentences, assessing their positive impact on classification accuracy. CiteFusion ultimately demonstrates robust performance in imbalanced and data-scarce scenarios: experimental results show that CiteFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, with Macro-F1 scores of 89.60% on SciCite, and 76.24% on ACL-ARC. Furthermore, to ensure interoperability and reusability, citation intents from both datasets schemas are mapped to Citation Typing Ontology (CiTO) object properties, highlighting some overlaps. Finally, we describe and release a web-based application that classifies citation intents leveraging the CiteFusion models developed on SciCite."

Since this browsing process resembles a walk in a citation network, we operationalize the concept using the transition probability (TP) of random walkers. The proposed measures are continuous, symmetric, and can be implemented on any citation network. We conduct validation tests of the TP concept and other extant alternatives to gauge which metric can classify papers and predict future co-authors most consistently across different scales of analysis (co-authorships, journals, and disciplines). Our results show that the proposed basic TP measure outperforms alternative metrics such as personalized PageRank and the Node2vec machine-learning technique in classification tasks at various scales. Additionally, we discuss how publication-level data can be leveraged to approximate the research interest similarity of individual scientists. This paper is accompanied by a Python package that implements all the tested metrics."

to measure the degree of similarity between scientific papers. These approaches
are intuitive, easy to put into practice, and computationally cheap. Moreover,
they have been used to generate a map of science, allowing visualizing research
field interactions. Nonetheless, these methods do not work unless two papers
share a standard reference, limiting the two papers usability with no direct
